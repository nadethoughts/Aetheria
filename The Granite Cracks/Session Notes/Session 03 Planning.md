## 🧭 Scene 3: The Decision Point (45 min)

**Options Presented to Players:**

### 🛡️ Option 1: Rescue the Captives

- Leads to a tense extraction mission
- Risk of alerting reinforcements
- Survivors may offer fragmented intel: “They spoke of a second force… but not from here.”

### 🏰 Option 2: Return to Ironhold

- Allows them to report findings directly
- [[Varric Silvervein]] uses the report to push for southern reinforcements
- The king sends trusted subordinates south, leaving the north exposed

### 🧭 Option 3: Pursue Another Lead

- Investigate the battlefield further
- Follow ogre tracks deeper into the wilds
- Seek out a dwarven hermit or lorekeeper

**Contingency Planning:**

- If they split the party or delay, Kael warns: “Every hour we wait, more dwarves suffer.”

## 🧠 Subtle Hints of the Northern Threat

Use sparingly:

- A rescued dwarf mutters: “They said the real war hasn’t started yet.”
- Kael mentions: “They were too well-informed. Someone fed them our defenses.”
- A broken dwarven communication device references “northern pass” but is dismissed as outdated
