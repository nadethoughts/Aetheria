# Backstory

Hurgan’s story is carved into the wind-scoured peaks above Ironhold, where the sky is sharp and the nights are long. Born to the Night Watch, he learned vigilance before he learned to speak—his earliest memories are of standing guard while others slept, eyes fixed on the shifting shadows beyond the firelight. His powerful build and weathered skin speak of a life spent in the open, braving the cold and the unknown.

Hurgan’s reputation as a ranger was forged in the high passes and deep forests, where he became a master of survival and a relentless hunter of threats to his people. His wild, practical hair and beard are as much a part of his legend as the frostwalker tattoos that wind across his skin, marking him as one who fears neither cold nor darkness. He is rarely seen without his war axe and warhammer—tools as much as weapons, wielded with the confidence of a dwarf who has faced down monsters and worse.

But Hurgan is more than a sentinel. His warm, intense eyes miss nothing, and his loyalty to Ironhold is matched only by his sense of duty to those who cannot defend themselves. He has uncovered secret tunnels during cave-ins, led evacuations through blizzards, and stood alone against horrors that shambled in the night. Among the clans, he is respected as a guardian and a guide—one who knows the land, the sky, and the silent language of danger.

Now, as Ironhold looks to reclaim its place in the world, Hurgan stands ready—vigilant, unyielding, and ever watchful for the next shadow on the horizon.
