# Session 00
Try six Yeah. The game is paused because I have it paused. So And you're recording. And I'm recording, so I can keep track of what decisions you guys make and be able to plan accordingly. I do have an adventure, but I do also like to use my players' back stories and different things that they've come up with to kinda help them along.

So, as you guys know, we are playing, team dwarf. So, we are this adventure itself, the craft granite is going to be taking place in the, Northern Mountain Range of do do I have it, but not readily available. But it's in the northern it's in the Northwestern Mountain Range of, Solaris. So kind of like where you guys were on the map, where you guys were on the map, Northwest. There's a big mountain range on the Western side.

This is in the Northwestern Mountains. The name of the community, is Iron Hold. And I have before we start building characters, I do have a little, a little introduction, to read that may help influence your decisions and things. So, so I'll go ahead and get started with that, and then we can start talking characters. So, when the flaming retribution scores the surface of the world, the dwarves did not burn.

They sealed their gates, reinforced their falls, and endured. For a year, Ironhold remained silent. Its people surviving by stone, steel, and stubborn and stubborn will. Now the gates have opened. Ironhold is a kingdom of clans.

Each clan has its own traditions, its own strengths, miners, warriors, scholars, traders, mystics, and scouts. Some dwarves are born into these clans. Others walk alone clanless, but without per both, not without purpose. King Hargren Deepmantle believes in believes the time has come to reclaim the surface. He sent out colonies, small footholds in the wilds to reestablish dwarven presence in the world.

Not all agree. Two factions now shape Ironhold's future. Isolationists believe their surface is still cur the surface is still cursed and that Ironhold must remain sealed and self sufficient. Expansionists believe that the world is ripe for reclamation, and the dwarves must rise again as builders and rulers. Tensions simmer, old grudges stir, and the fate of Ironhold may rest in the hands of those willing to walk beyond the granite walls.

You are dwarves of renown, adventurers, soldiers, champions. You are not bound by politics, but you are trusted to act with strength, wisdom, and honor. Before you choose your path, ask yourself, what plan do you hail from, or are you a planless, and what what do you believe Ironforge should become? The stone endures, but even stone can crack. So the thought behind this adventure is there are these political under undercurrents in Ironhold itself.

You are adventurers or soldiers or, you know, people that have made yourselves, made yourselves, known in the halls of Ironhold, as you've as you've done other things, hence the, hence the level three. In this, you the the adventure itself is going to be is going to be more of an exploration based adventure, with potential political undertones. So that's basically kind of what you're looking at as far as, like, you know, character creation, that kind of stuff. If you want, if you're building as you're building, you know, that those are those are the those are the tones of what the adventure is is gonna is going to be or at least my idea of what it's going to be. You may decide to turn my ideas on their head The first five minutes, that would start playing, but, you know, here we are.

So with that, does anybody have any ideas as far as, like, what class that they would want to, play from a dwarven purse from from that perspective at least. I'm assuming that we're not gonna be isolationists or whatever that clan was. You could be. You know? And you don't have to choose the same as the other people.

You know? You could have a separate you could be an isolationist working alongside the expansionists, or you could be somebody who's kind of, like, walking the line in between, seeing seeing value in both. You're not restricted. I don't see value in the isolation. That's interesting.

I was over oh, go ahead, Jason. I just said, oh, that's interesting. Alright. So I was I was overthinking it, and now I just think I'm gonna be a fighter. That's what I was thinking.

Well, there there ain't nothing wrong with just being a fighter. That's definitely, that's definitely a good class to choose for sure. Does spider in this in this, setting have the the flexibility that it it seemed to have in in D and D? It does, and it's actually a better fighter than most other martial classes. Okay.

Like, the the fighter in that direction myself. Okay. Group of dwarven fighters. Here we go. It's the habit.

Think back to all the That's why. Okay. Okay. So, Ramses. I mean So, Jason, I've given you two opportunities.

Ranger or barbarian or paladin? What do you think? Nah. Claret. Claret.

There you go. Probably not. I could be a ranger as well if nobody you need if we needed one. No. Well, we don't need nothing.

You wanna be a fighter, be a fighter. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep.

Yeah. I'm doing everything right now. Chris, what were you saying? Oh, I was just gonna say, Pathfinder well, I'm the this what I was saying to response to, you know, I you can switch classes. Like, Pathfinder is one of the few classes or few games where party composition doesn't really matter all that much.

I mean, it's still, you know, it's still relatively important, but at the same time, it's not necessarily, like, a it it it's not it's not the end of the world if we don't have a healer. And it's not the end of the world if we don't have a, if we don't have an arcane caster and, you know, you could do an you could do an entire group of nothing but fighters if you wanted to. Yeah. No. And I I've again, with the flexibility of the fighter in my head, you you can you can build a pretty diverse group with just fighters.

Yeah. Well, I'm I I will say Not that that's the way to do it, but it there Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think it still could.

I I I would I would say that if it depends on what you're trying to do as to whether or not the fighter is the be all and end all. Like, if you're if you want to do a sword and board guy or maybe a two handed weapon person, the fighter is a really good pick because they get a plus two on their on their to hit versus other classes. So you the chance of you creating is a little bit is is higher. But, if you're wanting to be a better, you know, a better shoot shooter, a gunslinger is by far the better pick. If you wanna if you wanna have tracking capability and woodsman and and woods and wood lore and that kind of stuff, Ranger is extremely powerful and also a very good pick.

So, like, if, like, in in D and D three five, I think there was just kind of, like, everybody had to dip into fighter a little bit because you got you got a bunch of free feats and that kind of stuff, but you could really kind of make your fighter into whatever you wanted. You've got a little bit of that here, and there is more flexibility with the fighter. You can have two fighters that don't look anything like each other, and that kind of thing. But if you're going for a specific flavor, fighter is a soldier. So if you're not wanting to do a soldier type character, then, you know, you it might not be best flavor.

Does that make sense? I see what you're saying. Yep. Yep. Yep.

Did I did I mangle any of that up, Ramsey, or do you have anything to add on that? Nope. That that that sounds correct. Okay. I guess my my question and not to dissuade anybody, but when you say you wanna make a dwarf fighter, like, what do you envision them doing?

Because to Chris's point, there may be something better than fighter. I don't I don't know that I have a vision beyond Okay. Oh, it is a dwarf. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. And let's let's make him good with a hammer. Sure. You know, something of that nature.

I think I was thinking the quest was gonna be somewhat of we're finding stuff. So that's why I was kinda torn between fighter and ranger. Yeah. If we were going further areas or just find the, you know, that the land is inhabitable and maybe some mountain we were gonna find to, like, relocate our people to or something like that. That's why I thought Ranger might be cool too.

But I wonder because where did you put out, Chris, the like, you put out the classes. There's, like, 25 somewhere, but didn't you put somewhere, like, hey. These are the ones to look at, like, 10 or eight or something like that? Yeah. I sent out a player in discord.

And yeah. But I can just read off the the ones that were the ones that were common classes that that dwarves pick. There's fighter, cleric, ranger, inventor, champion, rogue, gunslinger, kineticist, and wizard. And really, I mean, when it comes to when it comes to class selection, like, you can make a dwarf that's good at dang near anything, but a dwarf does have a lower, charisma. So charisma based classes, are at a detriment for a dwarf.

Doesn't mean that they're terrible. There's they'll still be good. They just won't be as good as somebody who's not necessarily charisma based. So the the ones that I listed off, those ones are more those ones are either strength, dexterity, constitution, or intelligence based classes. What's an exemplar?

I'll get it. An exemplar is a, that is a, that's what Clark wants to be. It's it's basically a, a character that has the divine spark inside of them. So, like, basically, the basically, a god granted you or you found something that awakened a divine spark in you. So you're a you're a pseudo demigod.

Okay. I can't be that. Hard boiled. Against my religion. Who didn't know that?

Can dwarves be monks? Dwarves can be monks. Dwarves make great monks. Just tough because the fighter is an expert in all the weapons already. True.

True. And like like I said at the beginning, like, if you wanna if you want if both Jason and if Jason, both you and Scott wanna play fighters, play fighters. Don't feel like you have to pick something different. That's perfectly fine. What are you thinking, Ramsey?

Sure. I'm between a few things. Are are we doing any optional stuff or nah? I'm assuming nah. But we are, actually.

Okay. We're doing the free archetype. Okay. And we are doing, we're doing the, the, ancestral paragon. Okay.

And I'm trying out the instead of the automatic bonus progression, I'm trying out the automatic rune progression with this instead, which I don't know if you're familiar, but basically, effectively what it does is it does a similar thing as automatic bonus progression, but it just grants weapon and armor runes over time. And it doesn't remove the item bonuses from anything. It's just like you just automatically get the item bonuses for your for your for your, base level runes on your weapons and armor. So Gotcha. Okay.

So slightly different than automatic bonus progression, bonus progression, where it removes item bonuses and then grant you certain things at certain levels. This just grants you automatic automatic base level runes. So Gotcha. Makes sense. And also, if people are having a hard time figuring out which thing they want to pick, keep in mind, I I run pretty loose with the this character didn't work the way I wanted.

I wanna do something different. So don't feel like you're stuck with the one with the one thing. I want you to I want you to be playing something that you wanna play and not be stuck with something that you don't wanna play. So you can you can feel free to be a little bit more, a little bit more decisive in your in your choosings just because you have the freedom to go back and retro and retrofit anything. Like, if you choose a class, you're like, I don't like this class.

We'll figure it out. So Is is Clark's, character a champion? Is that what he was? He is. Yep.

Okay. Chris, I'm just and this Yeah. Go ahead, Jace. Or go ahead, Scott. We've got clans of Ironhole.

Do we have to pick the same clan, or are we from different clans? You are from different clans. You guys are people that have rose in through the ranks in a you you have rose in through the ranks as a as a person of renown, as a dwarf of renown. You are aware of each other. Maybe you've worked you you've aware you are aware of each other, and you have worked together in the past.

But it doesn't necessarily mean that you are, like, teammates right this very minute. You can be, but you don't have to be. Okay. I think it would stretch me further to try to be a ranger, and I need to stretch myself when it comes to RPGs. I'm not quite ready to be a wizard.

Nobody really is quite ready to be a wizard. Right. God. Being a wizard is is its own unique, fun, little mini game. But, no, you should be ranger.

Okay. Loving it. What is what is this kineticist? I'm I'm not The kinetisist is it's it's it's kind of this it it's weird is what it is. It's basically a it's a class where you are infused with certain elements.

There are six elements in Pathfinder. There's fire there's fire, earth, air, and water, but there's also metal and wood as well. And as a kinetics, you attune yourself to one of those elements or two of those elements because you can do two, and you use powers that are called impulses that, basically shape those elements. If you're at all familiar with, Avatar, the the last airbender, like that sort of stuff, like, that's kind of what Kinesis is. Okay.

Okay. Yeah. I didn't think you would be Scott. What's kind of part of it about analysis is they are the how to say this? Not melee, but they are like the martial version of a spell caster.

Yeah. Jason. Like, you you pick, you know, a very, very small number of abilities. Like, I think at level three, you'll have, like, three abilities, but you could use them all day every day. You could use them whenever you want.

But they, like, mimic spells of your chosen element. Gotcha. But you don't have to worry about spell slots and all that hot garbage. Gotcha. Sounds interesting.

They are pretty cool. They are they're also, like, one of the I think they are the only class that their primary attribute is constitution. Mhmm. So I believe that's correct. So they're tough mofos.

Mhmm. Okay. Having an issue with my camera. Cool. Yeah.

Sounds sounds splendid. Okay. Where do we begin? Alright. So it sound Ramsey, it sounds like we got a ranger and a kinetics.

What do you want? We went from two fighters to a ranger and a kinetics assist. Sure. Absolutely. It's your opportunity to pick gunslinger for the wing for the wing.

Scott, are you, Scott, are you thinking, melee ranger or ranged ranger? Who I was thinking more melee ranger, like, what combination thereof? So Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yep. Okay. Okay. But I also saw something about giant wars, and I'm afraid that we don't have enough power to kill the giants.

Oh, that's literally what the ranger is for. It is very much what the ranger is for in more ways than one. You are not going to have nearly as much damage that you do in one attack as a ranger as a from the barbarian, but you're still gonna be doing a ton of damage. So and who knows? Maybe you will do as much damage.

I don't know. I've never actually seen a ranger played. So possible that they pump out as much damage as barbarian, but No. It's not fun for you, Chris, if you crit and kill the person in one blow. So we're going away from that.

We're we're moving aside. Okay. Woah. Woah. Are you rolling dice?

You may even have characters yet. I was just checking out what theme I need. Oh, are you down, like, in your settings? Yeah. So, Ramsey, did we break you?

Well, I'm just trying to decide. The the things I'm between are now different. You want me to just you do you want number to them, and do you want me to pick a number or see if you like it? I'll figure it out. Go go go ahead and get started.

I can assume that we catch catch up. Alright. So we'll go ahead and connect to the right computer. Mhmm. Okay.

So to get started, everybody, let's build some characters. So what you're gonna wanna do is go over to the, excuse me, go over the right hand side where the actors are and underneath party, the party, you will see a person with a plus sign on it, I think. Maybe. Okay. Yeah.

There was. Okay. So if you click on that being the thing. If you click on that, you will officially you'll have a actor that gets created. And then at that point, like, you don't necessarily have to come up with a name right at that very minute.

You can just click on create actor and it'll, it'll automatically assign player character to it, or you could put in your name just to keep just to keep things going. But in a character, have a blank character sheet that's pop that pops up. Let me know when you have the blank character sheet. I have a blank character sheet. Alright.

Ancestry dwarf. Yep. So first thing you wanna do is is pick the pick the magnifying glass and then dwarf is the first entry on the thing. Just click on the green check mark and that will add it. And then it'll give you a selection about whether or not you are, doing a clan dagger or a clan pistol.

Your clan, grants you at childbirth, it gives you a dagger or a pistol. And it's basically kind of like kind of like an ancestral art. It's an ancestral artifacts sort of thing. It's a very good knife, and it's not really like terribly game breaking. But you have to choose whether or not you're gonna wanna have a dagger or a pistol.

Once you make that selection, you will have to Sorry, Chris. Yes. Oh, you were naming your character? I named my character. I have a blank character sheet, so I think I'm in the same spot that Scott is.

But, Right. I'll So same. Okay. So you need to click on the magnifying glass next to the and pick the green check mark next to dwarf with the pop up. Magnifying glass next to ancestry.

Ancestry. Okay. Let's pick the dwarf. And then you have an option of a clan pistol or a clan dagger. Just pick one.

If you think you'll use a pistol more, get a get a pistol. If you think you'll be more melee, get a dagger. It's generally the the thing to go with. Okay. Sorry.

Alright. Thank you. Yep. So once you've gotten your ancestry, now it's time to pick your heritage. So if you go to the check mark checkbox next to your heritage, that will bring up all of the dwarf heritages plus any plus any all of the, all of the, what are they called?

Versatile heritages, which are the things like the dragon the dragon blooded, the Asammar, the half orc, and that kind of stuff. But the first things that you're presented are going to be specifically dwarf things. So you can pick any one of those. And if you're not sure which one to pick or you wanna know more information, that's the check mark. There's a little little notepad.

If you click on that, it'll pop open the it'll pop open a description. Any references to any proper named characters may or may not be correct, but you can at least get the general gist of of what the of which dwarf ancestry or which dwarf heritage you want. And I'm just, I I I don't know, Jason. I don't know if this is the the right call or not, but since you're playing in Kineticis, there's this elemental heart dwarf. Seems like it might go well.

What goes well with my guy? Let's see. You're a ranger. Well, I mean, really, any of these could work. Between ancient blooded and brown blooded?

Let me take a look here. Strong blooded seems like it would be good for a ranger. Let me take a look at that ancient blooded. In ancient blood it just seems like it'd be good for anyone. Not really, specific.

Let me just take another look at strong blood. Okay. So strong blooded is, like, really, really, really good against poison. Like, if you get poisoned, like, you reduce the stage of the poison by two for every for every successful saving throw. You gain poison resistance equal to half your level.

So, I mean, as far as, like, like, it's super strong against poison. Poison isn't everywhere in the game though, but, like, if Right. You ever get poisoned, like, that that would be that would be a killer heritage for. Sounds fun. You you can bring it in.

Yeah. Well, if you get resistance against poison, guess what? Poison's gotta be showing up. That's just So poison my comrades? Maybe.

Maybe. Oh, no. There's a lot of backgrounds. Okay. So backgrounds backgrounds are kinda kinda tricky here.

There are tons and tons and tons. In general, kind of what I do when I'm looking at backgrounds, is I actually go to archives of Memphis. And I look at the backgrounds in there, and then sort them by, like, a background that'll give my that will give my primary attribute a boost. But most backgrounds and I'm gonna I'll just send that over. Most backgrounds will give you a free boost.

So even if it doesn't work for your primary attribute, it's something that you could, make make your second primary your your second attribute work for it. But, Where's my Where? What is my primary attribute? For a ranger for a melee ranger, really, it it depends, but it could be either agility or strength. If you're planning on on hitting things with hammers, it's probably a strength.

And give me one second, and I can pop it up in the chat here. But, also, another very valid tactic when it comes to when it comes to, backgrounds is just pick it on vibes. Just go through and be like, I feel like my character would I feel like this would be a fun background for my character to have. That totally works as well. Because generally, you can make it work for your primary attribute.

As an example, like, just picking on vibes kind of thing. Like Scott as a as a ranger, animal whisperer might be a good one. Animal wrangler could be another one. Let's see what else. Sea deep diver or a deep sea diver could be one, although you are out in the mountains, so that would be kinda weird.

But, demon slayer for that? Scout is a good one. Yeah. Scout would be perfect for you. Early explorer could be a good one too, and that would be a good one for, like, you know, kinetics as well.

Field medic could be useful for anyone. Fireworks performer could work for the kinetics, especially if you're doing fire gate. Gambler could be fun. Gladiator. Card.

Hunter. Like, I mean, you could also use this to kind of shore up something, like, if you're if it doesn't necessarily vibe with your class, but it's something that you want your class to be good at, or you want your character to be good at, you can pick a different background that might help help facilitate that. Jeweler. That's if you wanna be more spooky. Or it could be fun.

I think I'm gonna pick night watch unless you say it's terrible. Go for it. Secular medic. So if I choose my class as a ranger. Yep.

Select a hunter's edge. Right. So this is your subclass. Studying and vindicator. Okay.

Yep. So this is your subclass. Ranger, So you've trained to become a skilled hunter and tracker, gaining an extra benefit when you hunt prey depending on the focus of your training. Choose a hunter's edge. I would love to.

There we go. Right. So you really have you've got four different edges. So the flurry ranger is a dual wielding, ranger. Gives you the ability to hit a bunch of times.

So you you are able to, you're able to hit more often, more accurately with your second and third attacks and that kind of thing. Out which Because between flurry and provision or precision. Excuse me. Yeah. Precision is because I'm thinking flurry because dwarfs aren't like I mean, a ranger maybe is a little bit more precise, but dwarfs are kind of like a bludgeoning scenario.

Dwarfs could be they could be they could be pretty precise if they wanna be. They don't think things that But zero. No. Yeah. Or at least But, no.

Yeah. No. Flurry is flurry is definitely not a bad route to go for Ranger. That's that's one of the one. That that's definitely a a a good a good thing to do.

Yeah. I could see precision too because it's a Ranger. But Yep. I mean, it takes precision to wash all those dishes. You went and washed the hobbit.

You saw how precise they were. Right. Precision in the chaos. Alright. Jason, how are you doing with the backgrounds?

Sifting. Sifting. It would be nice if there were a few less. I'm guessing that many, many of them grant the same basic bonuses or whatever. They do.

So it was like Right. Because you could just consolidate them in into fewer things and and Well trying to create the story. Yeah. It's it's calling out that flavor. So they all have similar bonuses.

Like, I mean, you've only got, like, six attributes. Right? So those ones are those ones are matched. But every but but the backgrounds also grant additional powers, and that's kind of where the where the rubber hits the road. But like I said before, don't feel like you have to pick the right thing here.

I would say just go just go pick on vibes and, like, if you're like, oh, I want my character to be this sort of person. I mean, give them that background, and then just try it out. See and if it didn't work out for you, then we can switch it out. So I don't know which d and d to pick. There's, like, a thousand.

Yeah. Don't feel like you have to get one. And I did and I didn't actually bring in any of the ones that I that I created for the setting in here. So if you do, you know, feel so don't feel like you need to pick a deity, but if you wanna have a a deity that your character serves, then just kinda let me know and I'll make sure that that's included in here. So don't don't feel like you have to worry about that.

So when I was picking things like night watch, it said you had to pick strength and then something else. Like, is that in our proficiencies? Or does that automatically happen? It will be in your attributes where where that where that goes. So, so if you go to the bottom of that first page where you've got attribute modifiers, the exit or the edit button, not the exit button, the edit button should be highlighted orange.

If you click on that, that will pop up a dialogue with your boosts. So you've got your dwarven stuff in there already. You basically just need to pick one additional boost in your dwarven stuff, then your background should be on there as well, and your class will be on there as well. Okay. And that should just kinda walk you through it.

If you look at the left hand side, you'll be able to tell how many picks you've got left, because there'll be a circle with a number in it. Alright. Now it's time to pick class, Jason. So when you choose the kinet assist, you will have an option of a single gate or a dual gate kinet assist. And basically what that means is, if you're a single gate kineticsis, then you have one element that your character can interact with and bend.

Your dual gate, you've got two. So it just depends on whether or not you wanna have only this elemental power or if you wanna have two different elemental powers. The single gate gate are really powerful in their own individual, like, element, and the dual gate are less are are more versatile. So that's kind of basically what what the what the difference is. I'm usually one who tries to be, versatile, so I should probably just choose a single gate.

Okay. It's just so hard to do. It's so hard to do. Because Duo just sounds like so much more fun. Do it.

Yeah. Why not? You would have to make one more decision in that, but, you know I know. Right? All the decisions.

At the end of the day, sort of course, interesting. Gosh, you start choosing feats. Yeah. So if you're finished with your attributes, then at that point, we will move on to your let's do proficiencies just to make sure that you've got those in there. Your initial proficiencies as a ranger, at first level, you gain a number of proficiencies equal to, perception saving through skills.

Here we go. So you are automatically trained in nature. You're automatically trained in survival, and you have a number of additional skills equal to four plus your intelligence modifier. So you can be trained in four plus your intelligence modifier skills, on top of nature and survival. So my intelligence is plus one, so I just get four?

You get five. Okay. How close is that? Somebody's attacking somebody. You can go with an easy one, could you, Ramsey?

I don't know what you're talking about, Chris. I just snuck a peek. I see what's going down here. I was between this and Gunslinger, to be fair, so it was either gonna be real simple or real complicated. I'm gonna have to get some summoner stuff.

Idle on this. Idle on that. Alright. Right. Right?

But I realized the gunslinger I wanted to play, was kind of similar to, like, the monk gun wielder I was playing in the D and D game the one time. So I'm like, I kinda already did that. Fair enough. Oh, wait. Wait.

Wait. Wait. So that's the reason I'm not doing it. I chose five things to be trained in, Chris. Okay.

They have I'm skipping deity. Okay? Yeah. Skip it. Not okay.

Okay. That's perfectly fine. Okay. Age. How how old should a dwarf be?

They are if if they they live to I, like, I think they can make it up to, like, 500 or something like that. You know? So if you're looking for somebody who's a little bit more of a more of a young dwarf, I'd be looking for somebody in their early hundreds, maybe. Alright, Scott. So Pergan has all of his proficiencies.

So now let's go ahead and jump into feats. So you know how this works. So just go ahead and Mhmm. Do your thing. We're choosing level one?

Yeah. We're choosing level one for now, and then we'll, and we'll level up as we go. Alright. We have what was your what which dates did you choose, Jason? I think I, chose one.

Oh, you did a metal? Yes. Nice. Seems seems pretty dwarfy. Yes.

That does track. Yes. So it's a metal and or, earth. Stone. Yeah.

Yeah. Earth or fire. Any of those Yeah. Fire. Yeah.

All three of those sound very dwarvish. And so I was debating about going between, if I did a dual, I was gonna do fire and and earth. Mhmm. Mhmm. But I chose against the dual dual Okay.

So, Jason, let's go ahead and do your proficiencies as well. And what we have for skills is you are trained in nature by default. I guess so. And you and athletics, it looks like. I think that was probably your background that did that.

Something. Yeah. Okay. And you get to choose three plus your intelligence modifier skills to be trained in on top of that. Since I have no intelligence, I guess, three.

How do I have to always be so stupid? Okay. So What am I doing here? Am I just increasing the already trained things? Or No.

You are choosing something. Yeah. You're choosing three separate skills to be trained in that you're not already trained in. Okay. Oh, no.

Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. I cannot kill it.

Chris, can you kill it? For what? My character. I'm all going I can't I can't kill me. Oh, I'm I'm I will delete your character?

Yes. Yes. Final answer. Okay. I'm I'm going gunslinger.

Oh. I'm just wondering what happened. I was look I was looking up I was looking at my proficiencies, and I'm like, I'm playing a Charisma caster. Like, I'm already my other character is a Charisma caster. Like, yes.

Summoner's different, but, like, I am like, oh, I'm just gonna be diplomacy and fricking deception again. And and all. No. No. No.

That's not what we wanna do. Fair enough. It can be intimidating. I mean, that's true. I can't.

Alright. Alright. Okay. Cool. Okay.

That could be cool. And, oh, no. Okay. So how are we looking, Scott? Plus.

There I just like them all, Chris. These feats, I really like the mountain strategy. Well, something to consider, as a as a dwarven paragon, you get access to two feats for the dwarven paragon. So pick your two favorites. Okay.

I guess I don't understand what you just said. So I have one empty slot in the ancestor fee? Yeah. But if you look down, if you scroll down, there's the ancestry Paragon fee? It's the same Okay.

The same group. Same group. K. Yeah. So if you've got two things that you like and you're having trouble choosing, just take them both.

And it doesn't matter if you're three or more I got. Rare or uncommon or nothing in the Well, generally, with a rare one And or an uncommon one, you wanna clear it with me first. But anything that isn't, anything that like, I I would say anything that's uncommon or lower, I'm gonna clear those immediately. If you've got something that's rare that you want, let's talk, and I'll you know, I won't be a jerk about it. So I, I need to do ability modifiers or whatever you wanna call those.

Oh, yeah. Yeah. Bonuses. Yes. I didn't I didn't do those.

So when I'm I'm looking at this, my Mhmm. Seeing it correctly, the dwarf automatically, you know, does the constitution, the wisdom. Right. And then I have one one to choose there Yes. In that in that role there.

Okay. Mhmm. Knowing nothing about what my guy is doing or what he is. I have no idea what he is. Even Mhmm.

Is there is there an attribute where I really wanna put a little extra focus? Or well, kinetics are I don't think they're heavily armored, so can't go wrong with can't go wrong with little decks. Fair. Metal Kineticist can be. Oh, never mind.

Never mind. Can armor. I don't know if I chose the armor. I might not have chosen the armor. Yeah.

Yeah. One of one of the metal kinetics's abilities, like, their spells, quote unquote, essentially is just bam. You have armor. Yeah. Okay.

Yep. But if you did choose that, then, yes, decks, very good. But, otherwise, I mean, if if you if you're if you're not running into an armor specific issue, then, like, I mean, I don't know. Maybe maybe intelligence? You know?

It I don't imagine that you're gonna be using a lot of you're gonna be hitting things over the head, like, with your fist much, but maybe. So it just kinda depends on what you wanna do on top of it. Okay. The thrill seeker, I have to choose either strength or constitution. Right.

And you want and you wanna choose con for all of your available boosts anyway. You wanna max out con as much as possible because that's what your kinetics abilities are based off of. Oh. Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah.

That could be helpful. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Alright.

So chose constitution for everything. Yes. Alright. Yeah. And really, I mean, it just kinda depends on, like, kind of how you see your character fitting in the group.

Like, if he's going to be more of a more of an intelligence based investigator type than maybe going intelligence. If you see him being more of a, more of, like, you know, a somebody who is, you know, getting into tight situations and getting out by the skin of their teeth and that kind of stuff. Maybe, maybe Dex or if he's like a heavy lifter, really, you know, likes punching things in the face, then go strength. Or you could do wisdom too. Wisdom would be would be solid, for the rest of your picks.

But or pick a few of or pick one of one of a few. You know? So do you see him being more of, like, an Indiana Jones archaeologist type of of thrill seeker? Because if he's that way, then maybe going heavier in intelligence. Mhmm.

I see. Or if he's more of, like, an Evel Knievel sort of thrill seeker, then maybe doing the Yeah. I guess I kinda that. I kinda saw it a little bit more that line of thinking there. Okay.

Yeah. Then then just drop it in decks. You know? It might it it might not affect you from an armor perspective, but I'm sure it'll help with with other skills and things if you're planning on doing that sort of stuff. Okay.

Hey, Chris. Yeah. Under my Ancestry Piergon feeds Mhmm. There's a lot. It's It's different than the Ancestry feats.

Okay. Let me see if I can get over there and just The guy chose the mountain strategy for the entry feats. Oh, that's because it's not the ancestor ancestor paragon isn't, isn't filtering. So what you need to do is go into the, trait section on the the the trait field on the left hand side and type in dwarf. War.

Got it. And that should pull in all your level one or fee things. Okay. Okay. So how in this, efficiencies area here Mhmm.

How do I know? Because it's not giving me a marker saying, hey. Here's the limit that you are allowed on on these in the in this skills area proficiencies. Yeah. It's Yeah.

It's not going to. It doesn't have any automations around that. You just need to you just need to be honest. So for your character, you've got you've got, nature plus three plus your intelligence modifier skills. Right.

Which is so I need two more. So Yeah. Okay. And a little losses. Where'd it go from there?

So next up is feats. So go to your feet section. But, what's the difference between acrobatics and athletics? Athletics is I would have athletics. Things.

Why would I choose acrobatics? Acrobatics allows you to do things that are more graceful. Like, if you needed to squeeze, squeeze through a tight area, that would be an acrobatics check. If you needed to run across a narrow ledge, that would be an acrobatics check. If you needed to, there's a specific combat action called tumble through that allows you to get on the other side of a bad guy by tumbling through their legs that legs that would be an athletic or an acrobatics.

So those sorts of things are what the acrobatics are versus the athletics, which is just like sheer muscle. Like Gotcha. You can jump high. You can pull you can carry heavy objects. You can win tug of war, you know, that kind of stuff.

Suggestions on the last one. I don't I picked all the ones. I'm like, I would, like, care about this one. Okay. In your demo lore?

I'm I'm trying to avoid survival, believing that that's gonna be taken care of by Oregon? Well, something that could be handy. Thievery might be a good one. Your, if, you know, that that could be used for picking locks, disabling traps, you know, it doesn't mean that you're it doesn't mean that you that you're just straight up a thief with a thievery skill. It just means that you're, you know, you've you're you're nimble with your hands.

Right? Yeah. Okay. Sounds good. Check me out, Chris.

Make sure I did everything right. I have to, just look at the time. I have to step out. My kids are at VBS. I gotta get them picked up, and I will be back home.

So I'm gonna be out for about, twenty minutes. Okay. See you when I get back. I'm sure Ramsey will fill two or three characters by then. Maybe.

Might make that summoner after all after this. Ramsey, you should just be a fighter. I should all just been fighters. Team fighter. Kind of a fighter.

Yeah. Gunslinger though. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. No, that's great. Gunslinger is a little bit more of a what? Oh, gunslinger is, it's a little bit like a fighter, but it's also a little bit like a, like a support role as well. Like, they do trick shots that basically set people up for being able to, being able to do, you know, get get people off guard and that kind of stuff.

So, like, they can they can do a lot of things that that kind of fall more on, like, a more on, like, a caster role, but they're not casters. And they still shoot they they still, like, you know, hit like a hit like a ton of bricks because they also Ranged. Yeah. Would Jason be ranged too? He'll be mid range is basically what the Kinesis is.

So it can be ranged, but it also can be melee. It's kind of like this. It's it's it's it's an interesting thing. Alright. So, Scott When do I get to pick some more weapons?

So before well, I'll leave it. Graduate. Okay. Yeah. No.

I'm and it's Hurgan is is your guy. Right? Yep. So I think that's how you'd say it. I just Googled some dwarf male ranger names.

That sounds awesome. Okay. So everything looks kosher. So the next piece is leveling. So you need to change your level from level one to level three.

Up top where that level shield is, you can just delete the number and put a three in there instead. Okay. So much. Now you have more feats. More feats to choose?

Yep. Keep in mind to choose. To choose. Yeah. Is there anything?

Oh, all the proficiencies just went up. Okay. Yeah. So you will get additional you will, you do get one additional skill proficiency at level two. So let me Can you go from trained to expert, or do you just go to trained?

Yeah. So no. At level two is when you get your skill feed, so you don't get a a skill increase. At level three is when you get skill increase, and that will go up to you can either boost a train to an expert or pick another skill and and make that entrained. Either one of those you can do.

Right now, we're just making one trained. Correct? No. So at level two, you get a skill fee. So you'll need to pick your skill fee first, because there are skill, skill limits.

So pick your skill fee. But then once you pick your skill feed, you can either increase one of your trained skills to expert or pick another skill and make that trained. Okay. So either way. The only reason why I'm make why I'm having you do the skill feat first is because skill feats have, you know, you need a skill at this level, you know, you add expert in order to be able to do this skill feed and that kind of stuff.

And at level two is when you get your skill feed. So So choose a level two skill feed first? Yep. Yep. Yes.

Am I good for the explosive savant dwarven ancestry feat? It is uncommon. Yes. Yeah. It's it's about, like, growing up being exposed to guns and explosives and things like that.

That sounds very fitting. Oh, man. Well, I thought so. Yep. Yeah.

About the only time that you might get me to push back on on, Ancestry feed is if there's a really powerful rare feed. But Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

But outside of Adam doesn't fit at all. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But, yeah, outside of Adam.

Yep. It's cool. It's cool. Okay. Well, I actually don't know.

We're just gonna go with the dagger. That makes sense more. And then, Oh, well, that seems pretty okay. That's wow. That's actually quite good.

It's a dwarf feat that at the end of your turn, you reduce frightened by two instead of one like normal. Right? That is really good. Oh. Weird.

There. Okay. Okay. Alright. Efficiencies check.

I am not sure which skill to choose, Chris. So many options. The skill feeds? Skill feats. Okay.

So with the skill feats, generally, what I have found useful, and and grant, I haven't played this game a lot. Mostly, I've ran it. But what I found useful is finding a skill that you want to do something cool with, and then only looking at the skill feats that are associated with that skill. So if you wanna focus on if you wanna focus on your athletics and, you know, getting something doing that, you can do that. Or or nature or survival, as a ranger, you know, survival is kind of one of your bread and butter skills.

So maybe you wanna take a look at survival skill feeds and see if there's something specific in there that speaks to you. Or, How do you filter them? So you do that by, going to pull up the dialogue so I can make sure I'm giving you an accurate thing here. Okay. So if you scroll down, on the left hand side, there's a skills section.

And if you just expand the skills section, you can pick a skill. Okay. Oh, hey. Jason's back. Hey.

I'm back. Sorry. So I'm yeah. You guys are doing your thing. You're amazing.

Yep. And so let's see. Where are we, Jason? You've got your skills. We're working on your feats.

Yeah. Okay. And same thing to you as what I said to Scott. Ancestry feats, you get two ancestry feats at level one because you are a dwarf paragon. So if there are two that you like, then don't feel like you have to choose between.

Okay. Let's say for those fees, choose a level one to simplify the list? Yeah. And, also, make sure that the trait dwarf is on there as well. Okay.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I see. Yep.

It's there. Doesn't you know, it's not really it's not giving me anything except level one, so that's not a big deal. Yep. Okay. So, Scott, looks like you've got a skill feat.

Have you chosen a proficiency that you want to make expert or train yourself in a new proficiency? I thought you said I couldn't do the Oh, you can now. Now that you pick the skill feat, you can do that. Okay. So I'm gonna become an expert in survival.

Okay. Perfect. And then, you know, going back to feats, now you just need to pick a class feat. More feats. Now, so here's here's the trick with these feats.

Most of the time, you're not gonna wanna go and look at lower level feats. Most of the time you're gonna want the the current level feat. But when you click on the class feats, it shows you the first level ones along with the second level ones. So really kind of a good way of being able to filter it is scrolling down to the levels section, and then just picking two out of two. And that'll show you only the second level feats that you can choose from, which should be a little bit easier.

Skills too? Right. Well, no. You can't sort them by skills, but also the class feats are including dedication feats. But since you already have the free archetype, you know, variation, you probably don't need to do the the dedication feeds.

So just exit the dedication feeds, and they'll drop you down to what you have in your ranger feeds, which is like 10 or less. So and in general, those class feats will lend themselves to a certain type of ranger, like there are certain class feats that are more that seem better for flurry rangers versus precision rangers and that kind of stuff. So, Okay. Some of those, you don't really have access to. Like, the monster warden, I think, is built on monster hunter, and you didn't pick monster hunter as your you took twin takedown instead, so that one is not available.

I do wanna redo this. Let's see here. Jason, if you wanna narrow down your, your class feats, to ones that you can actually use because, you know, obviously you can't do the earth air and that kind of stuff. In the trade section, if you type in metal, that should narrow things down. Yeah.

It's not doing it, though. I don't know. Yeah. It looks like there's a couple less maybe. I don't.

I took the dwarven. Dottiness. Mhmm. I was looking at that one. I thought that might be a good one for someone who's a thrill seeker.

Oh my gosh. Well, I think I know how to do it, but it's basically turning off it is basically looking, searching for each of the elements and then pressing the, clicking the no button to turn them off, and it's narrowing it down. Okay. So what you're looking at is elemental familiar, extended kinesis kinesis, flash forge, magnetic pinions, metal carapace, Shard Strike Okay. Burstal Blast I guess I weapon fusion.

Yeah. I'm not I'm not looking at those ones, I guess. Like, none of those are mine. Like, I'm not seeing any of those, I guess. Well, you specific to that other class.

Right? No. This these are the, you know, these are the kinetisys metal or Not the ancestry feats. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were looking at kinetics stuff.

My mistake. Not yet. I I was gonna do the two ancestry feats and That that makes sense. Oh, we did we did we did discover with those that if you, that the ancestry paragon, you need to go into the trade section and type in dwarf in there in order to be able to get only the dwarf feats. They don't filter it like they did in the original one.

K. So that should make it a little bit easier on you. Scott, did you take wilderness born? In what? Wilderness born.

And, ancestry feats or class feats? Ancestry. That might be in class as well for you. I took mountain strategy. Mhmm.

What did you say? Wilderness porn. I was just wondering if you took it. Not saying that you should. Honestly, didn't even click on it.

I really, I'm not sure that I'm catching the flavor of this Kineticis guy. Should should I so I guess part of what I'm I guess I'm partly thinking, like, with the metal thing a little bit like a magneto type fellow. Mhmm. Should I, in the the fantasy world, be is he going to be a ranged individual in combat? Is he going to be a a melee individual?

Yeah. He's gonna be more diplomatic. Like, I mean, the guy's a moron, so I don't think he's going to be very diplomatic. But Yeah. So as far as as far as, like, whether or not he's gonna be ranged or melee, that is yes.

Is the answer. Okay. You can do ranged. You can do melee. You won't be able to do extreme range, so you're more of a mid range to melee combatant.

So, like, you'll be able to, like, fling metal from, like, 30 feet away, that kind of thing. But you won't be able to, like, you know, be sixty, seventy, 80 feet away. And you can also and, like, when you're actually, like, in melee, you're you're able to do you know, you're able to, you know, hit with with the metal, with with the, metal element as well when you're in melee. So you're basically kinda effectively, you you're you're kind of a versatile character as far as, like, which range band you're you're supposed to be working with. Alright.

So okay. So that kinda, I guess, fits with some of what I was thinking there. I was yeah. I'm I'm on the edge with this guy of of leaning more roguish. Okay.

No way. And so I'm trying to break that out of my head. Oh, you don't wanna be? I don't know that I wanna run it like a rogue or I wanted to drop that old class and just go rogue, but, I'm I'm, so I'm trying to push myself in a different direction here. Does it does it make sense, to do, like, the dwarven weapon familiarity?

It Or You're you're primarily not going to be attacking with weapons. Although, I'm not sure if you if some of your powers work with them. Yeah. So you're, as any kind of kinet assist and, correct me where I'm wrong here, Chris, because I've not looked too deep into it. But your kind of primary attack is going to be a power that's just kinetic blast, and it's different for each element, what it looks like, and they have different properties.

But your kinetic blast can either be ranged, you know, like you throw metal at somebody or something, or they can be melee. And in the case where they're melee, they can get different bonuses. But in that case, it would be like, you know, almost like you, like, summon or create some kind of metal thing to whack them with, and then it, you know, vanishes or whatever. Yeah. Gotcha.

Exactly. So I mean, as far as like using weapons, unless there's some sort of kin unless there's some sort of kinetis power that specifically, like, empowers a weapon and makes it you're not really gonna be using them a whole lot. Okay. So I am largely gonna be running around unarmed. Yeah.

Well, it's like the, it's like the, the four, in three five, there was a and I think that there there's one in in fifth edition. There's a monk, an elemental monk that basically was able to channel elements and do a bunch of damage with with with the different elements and that kind of stuff. That's kind of the flavor of a Kineticist. It's like an elemental monk. So it's not the same as a monk because it doesn't have all like the, you know, run up walls things and that kind of stuff.

But, the flavor is more is more monk ish, which is probably why you're picking up that thief vibe because monks and thieves kind of have similar abilities. Okay. But it's not necessary that you be, you know, I I'm not trying to pigeonhole you into a monk, which is why I really haven't talked about it because it's, you know, you can be a you can play Knessis any kind of which way you want to. But like basically kind of the way that a lot of people think about like when Knessis are doing their thing and basically doing these elemental blasts and stuff. It's like they make they they perform certain hand gestures and kind of, like, do things that kind of create, create the the the the the the bending or the elemental mastery, if you will.

Although that's just flavor. Right? So if you wanna if you wanna do that if you wanna do the character like, like Magneto, where he just kinda thinks and things happen, that's perfectly that's perfectly allowed in the in the general flavor of of the kinetisist. Okay. And if you wanna know kind of what your what your attacks and things will look like, I did go ahead and use your channel elements and put it on your character.

So if you go over to your actions section there, you'll see an entry called Elemental Blast Metal. That's your that's your main attack. Chris, can I ask one quick question? Absolutely. What's that?

I don't see any level three ancestry paragon feats, just level ones. Is that Yeah. That's probably I think that you get ancestry feats typically at first and fourth, I wanna say. So you just get extra feats here. Yeah.

Your ancestry feed no. It's fifth fifth level. Okay. So Will you have a moment? Will you look my character over as I go get a drink and maybe a snack?

Sure. Skills, combat climber. Mhmm. How did that happen? When when did I choose that?

That was probably your background. Okay. Oh, okay. That's what the BG stands for. Okay.

Perfect. Yeah. No. Archetype feeds, general feeds, no bonus feed, last feed. Shouldn't have done the ancestry or the dwarf paragon.

That's just adding a bunch of hullabaloo in here. It's pretty it's cool, though. Like, the racial feats are neat. Yeah. They are.

They're cool, and they're flavorful, and it's just it is Uh-huh. Alright. So, looking at the class feed there, how did we go about getting rid of all of the additional ancillary? Okay. So I I actually threw up a, a screenshot of what I did in, in Discord.

But basically, I searched for earth, air, fire, water, and wood. I added those into the trait section. And then there's like a little no smoke a little no smoking sign on there. If you click on that, it removes it says everything that isn't this. And that'll leave you with the one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

Seven feats that you do actually have access to. Oh, did you do that in the trade section? Mhmm. Yep. Okay.

Earth, air. What was the other one? Earth, air, fire Earth, air, fire, water, and wood. Pathfinder for, whatever reason decided that they wanted to follow the eastern concept of of elements. So that's where metal and wood came into play.

Mhmm. Yeah. And did you do the little no smoking side and get everything taken care of? Yes. Cool.

Yeah. That's true. That was Cool. Cool. Cool.

I tried for whatever reason, when I tried that in the trades last time, I must've been doing something wrong because it wasn't pulling those up. Yeah. No. And, like, I I tried to just search for the ones that had metal in there, but it didn't do it. But, apparently, it was looking for a blacklist, not white not a white list.

Hi, Scott. Everything looked good on my end. Like, I think you got everything taken care of here. Now all that we need to worry about is equipment. And as I yeah.

Equipment. And as I as I said in Discord, since they're starting at level three, they actually have a level three equipment guide. They've got a level by level equipment guide here. So, basically, what this is is a second level, or it is a level three, guide. You're able to get one second level permanent item and two first level permanent items.

So how do you do that? Alright. I'm anticipating that question. Basically How do you do that? Oh, wow.

It's a good question, Scott. Let me tell you. If you go into your inventory section and you click on the, the magnifying glass that's next to any one of the item categories. I'm just gonna do weapons and shields. So if you click on that, it will pop up the compendium browser.

Inside the compendium browser, you'll want to deselect the shield and weapon on there. Then in the traits, you want to type in consumable. And then cons and then click on the little no smoking sign on the consumable trait. And that'll take away everything that is a consumable, so everything that's left is permanent items. Then, in the levels section, you will want to in the level section on the left hand side at the bottom, you'll want to pick level two to level two.

And that is all of the permanent items that are level two that you have access to. Now if you're looking for a specific sort of permanent item, say a weapon or a shield or armor or equipment, or something like that, you can go through the inventory types and and pick that, and that will give you an idea of what's available at level two. However, Does it matter how much it costs? No. Our rooms for weapons and armor are taken care of, right, with the whatever whatever?

Yeah. Yep. Automatic. Got it. Duck.

Yeah. The automatic rune progression. Yeah. Mhmm. Mhmm.

Mhmm. Okay. Base runes are taken care of for that. And you said level two to three? No.

It's level two to two. So you get one level two item and then you get two level one items. So you're gonna wanna do the same thing with level ones. And then after that, you get 25 gold that you can spend any way you want. So you can pick up additional weapons, equipment, things, as long as it's not any as long as the level is three or lower, you can spend any of that 25 gold on whatever you want.

Do we already have armor? You do not. So you'll have to figure out your armor situation. And for you, Scott, you see proficiencies. As a ranger, you have access to light armor and medium armor.

So those are those are you're not gonna be able to get heavy armor. But Okay. Alright. Jason, what's cool? Like that versatile blast, the weapon infusion.

They both seem, like, pretty neat. They dropped one in, but it's not showing up. Oh, there it is. No. That's not it.

Oh, it did. It went into bonus feats. It didn't Yeah. I'll just move it up. Yeah.

I'll move it up to class feats. There you go. Burstal blast. I don't get a bonus feat. Right?

No. No. Because they show that I have okay. So I think we're done with feats. Yay.

Okay. Excellent. So you're you you thought you were done with feats. You're not done with feats. So now you're leveling your character.

So you'll want to take that level one in the shield in the upper right hand corner and change that to a level three. Alright. Now there's a very specific order in which I want you to be, in which I want you to be doing things. I want you to pick a new skill feat at level two. So find this find another skill feat that that you want.

Then after that, change your upgrade one of your proficiencies from trained to expert, or pick another proficiency and change that to trained, and then do the rest of your feeds. K. Skilled feeds. Is there anything I should be doing to limit the 1,400 of these that are available? Absolutely, there is.

I will give you the same advice that I gave that I gave Scott. My advice is go to your proficiency section, find a skill that you wanna be able to do something cool for. And once you've chosen that skill, then in the skill feed section in the skill feed compendium browser, on the left hand side, there's a skills section that you can expand and just pick that skill. And look at the skill feeds in there, see if one speaks to you. And then if you don't like any of those, just pick another skill and keep going.

Advice, Chris? Yep. Would you use your level two on armor or a weapon? I did take a look at the level two weapons. There isn't really anything except for hand wraps as heavy blows.

So I would use my level two on armor. And armor can be, you said, medium. Right. Like that. Fashionably or something like that.

Yeah. Let's see here. There's a gray maiden play, but that sounds more like a woman's armor. K. So bastion plate is heavy armor.

Fortress plate is probably heavy armor as well. Yeah. Where do you see the difference? Okay. So size when it says size, that's a medium.

Yeah. So, basically, what you're wanting to do is you're wanting to click on one. So, like, say, I click the gray maiden plate in the, at that point it pops up a little dialog. There's a details tab. In the details tab, it'll tell you whether what category of armor it's in.

Anything that's labeled plate is probably going to be heavy armor. And I can't have heavy armor, you said. Right? Right. Looks like all of these are heavy armor.

Well? Yeah. So I I don't think they're they're magic. It's just the the highest level of base heavy armor is not available at character creation, which is why it's a higher level, I think. Right.

Okay. Well, you could use your so, Scott, you are you're a dual wielding ranger. You wouldn't be able to do this for both of your weapons, but, you could get a fanged rune, which is a level two, item. That would that would put that would be a rune on your weapon. And that has in the when it's activated, you transform into a small or medium an animal that wields the fanged weapon in its jaws.

The animal matches matches the animal that you most closely associate with, or a wolf. If a specific animal is a okay. And it's maybe maybe you don't wanna turn to an animal. But that's like the only level two rune in here. Let me see if I can find something else.

But we don't get any level three stuff even though we're level three. Right? Right. It's level one level two and two level ones. Okay.

Right. And those things are the the price, it you can it's any price, any any any gold. So if you've got, like, a really expensive thing that you wanna get and it's level two, spend your level two thing on that. Post. Yep.

Factory. Sick. Well, So, Scott, this one might be something that your character might be interested in. It's Jack's tattered cape. I'm gonna post it in the channel here.

Or not in the not in the channel, but in, on the page. Now it's a rare item, but Leap, high jump, or long jump, you gain a plus one item bonus. Yeah. So it's kinda weird. If you leap high jump or long jump, you gain a plus one bonus to stealth checks until the start of your next turn.

So, Chris, I'm wanting to do dual wielding. So, like, this ax musket needs two hands. I wouldn't wanna do that? Probably not. You're probably looking at, as far as dual wielding is concerned, you'd probably wanna do either two warhammers or two, or two, battle axes.

If you're wanting to go in, you know, just lean into the dwarf style, that that that be what you That's what I was trying to find, but I just don't see them. I don't think that they're level like, they might not be level one. Right? Or they might not be level two. They might be, like, zero level items.

Okay. That might be it might be thing there. Okay. But that means they don't hit as hard? No.

It it means that it mean, like, I mean, really at level three, you're not gonna be running around with a bunch of, like, magic weapons and that kind of stuff. So, as you gain as you go up in level, you're going to be you're going to get access to additional things. But, really the main thing that you care about with the weapons are your are are your, base level runes, like your plus one and your, striking runes, and those are those are what make your weapon more potent. And those are automatically being added to your weapon, so, you should be good with those. This is kind of fun.

I'm not sure how your character would feel about it being a ranger and everything, but there's this alchemist flamethrower. What it does is you load it with alchemist fire, and then you basically and you shoot it, so it gives you a little bit of a range thing. And when you do, whoever you aim it at, takes, in a 30 foot line or 60 foot line, has to make a basic reflex save, or take one d eight fire damage. Or no, they take one d eight fire damage, or, you know, half, and they have one persistent fire damage on top of that. For a lesser alchemist fire, then you should get more.

They bigger alchemist fires, they do bigger damage. But Dumb question. I mean, I was just thinking of getting, like, a sword and, like, either a hammer or an axe and then some armor. Okay. The level one, level two, and level zero are still throwing me off.

Okay. So, really, when it comes here when it come like, the the armor let me see what we've got at level one armor. So level arm level one armor, you've got you've got more stuff to work with. Cirque carapace is a medium armor. Give you a plus four item bonus.

That's a level one. Yeah. I like that one. Yeah. So, I mean, that's one of your level one ones right there is getting getting armor, getting that armor.

And the the rest of this stuff is just more along lines of, like, the the level two and the level one things are basically, like, as you have gone through your, time together, Or as you've leveled up, you've acquired higher level items. So that this is giving you that opportunity to have a higher level item. That's that's really all there is to it. So I'm not hurting myself by choosing level zero weapons? No.

No. Not even remotely close. The level the level two the level one, the level two items, these are supposed to be, like, magic items that you picked up in your adventures. They're not supposed to necessarily be weapons or armor. They can, but they don't need to be, especially at level three.

I mean, if you were level 10 and you were picking up level zero items for for weapons, maybe we'd be having to talk. But And really guys, don't spend a ton of time stressing about what you're picking. This is just flavor stuff. As long as you got two weapons in your hands and some armor, they're in good shape. Don't feel like you have don't feel like you're making the wrong decision.

One don't feel like you're making the wrong you have to make the right decision or you're gonna be you're gonna be terrible. That's not gonna happen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

I've made so many terrible decisions tonight. I don't know what to do. It's gonna be fine. Orin It's got all kinds of deals. You're gonna be just fine.

Two two two two two two. Hands. Hands. How are you doing, Jason? I'm gonna play that.

Not seeing much for the skill feed somewhere. Oh, this is great. They're they're not gonna be done. They're like, I mean, these aren't gonna be great things. So and they're not going to make your character more powerful.

Just straight up skill feats don't make your character more powerful. They just bring versatility in there. So if you're looking at skill feat and expecting to get expecting to get some sort of stat boost to make you better at doing stuff, it's it's it's it's not gonna they're mostly, like, role play related things. Mhmm. So alright.

So skill sheet, I picked one, then I move on to what? Then you need to increase one of your skills to expert or pick a new skill and make it trained. That's a tough one. Okay. Interesting.

Okay. Okay. On there? Moving on? Back to feeds, I'm assuming?

Yes. Back to feats. And then just go through and find more feats. Preferably level two feats for anything that's level two. Level three feats for anything that's level three, except for that Ancestry Paragon feat, which will only be another level one dwarf feat.

So so if you there was one dwarf feat that you left behind that you're like, man, would have liked that one. There's your opportunity. Oh, alright. So I'm in the class feat looking at so I need to go back through and add all of that wind. Right.

Why does it not in the trace? Let me do that. Oh, I would also remove the dedication feed as well. Turn that one off. Okay.

K. Air would first It may have selected things. Okay. What am I missing? I don't know.

Mhmm. K. So you've got your dwarven war axe, your war hammer, your hard shell. K. Did you purchase those?

Or I just dragged them because it wouldn't let me buy them. Okay. Well, that's because you don't have any money, but you do have money. So 3 gold, one gold. So you have 4 gold minus the 25 gold to spend.

So you have 21 gold left. Yeah. And then, Scott, like, I would just go through any of the start going through the equipment and seeing if he can find something at that's level two equipment, that that you think would be fun. And same thing with, like, a level one equipment, because you still need one level one equipment too. And I have to buy it?

Those equipments, you don't have to buy. Anything else that you anything else that you buy anything else that you have, you do need to buy. But I've given you 21 gold. Speaking of, Ramsey's dwarf is going to get 25 gold. So he so when he gets around to it, he can do his thing.

But you don't have to spend all 25 of that gold either. I would get a backpack or a or a traveler's pack or something like that, as well, just for rations and things. Oh, shit. Nope. Why can't we do it there, can't I?

Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. No.

No. No. No. I can do that. I, I do not find any real value in either of the level two kinetisys beats.

You wanna pick a level one feat that you missed? Because you can pick a level one feat. I'm wondering if if I'm just not understanding the two options. Or Oh, let me take a look. Points.

I mean, you could always pick up metal carapace, which would give you armor. Yeah. And that's level one. That one. Yeah.

We Kinetic activation. I'm just struggling to imagine an occasion in which that I that I would actually use. Well, and that's my problem with voice elements too. It's like, when when am I gonna talk to an elemental that just doesn't seem like it's a frequent occurrence, unless this is an interplanar world. Well, it is.

And we just have never explored it. So then maybe you would end up in a position where there are elementals running around. But, yeah. So I don't know. I just struggle to see how that one would be a thing you would employ.

And the same with the kinetic activation. I don't know that there's too many metal spells. Haven't seen any. Am I wrong in my assessment of those two? There are actually lots of metal spells out there.

Oh, really? Yeah. You just haven't seen them. Okay. We'll run with it because I would assume that this character might actually have seen those and know what those are.

So it's affected Jason does not. So done. I'll do that. Okay. Archetype c.

What's the archetype c? The archetype feet is, the that's the dedication. So, that's like, it can be, like, it's effectively a multi classing fee. Right? So there are a number of different dedication feats out there.

You can basically, basically just kinda go through there and find something that you think you're you would like your character to be secondarily good at. Again, like, these are more flavor things. Yeah. They add a little bit of they add a little bit of thing a little bit of crunch to your character, but, I definitely would rather you go through and just be like, you know, go through and find something that you're like, this sounds like this sounds cool and pick it, then basically just trying to agonize over what is the right decision because there is no right decision. Mhmm.

So Just like there is, don't backpack. What's what about adventurer's pack? But does it say backpack in the name? Adventure. Back.

Beck. Alright. Do you want it? Lot of the low level items are just really cool. Yeah.

I mean, they're a lot of them aren't, like, super powerful, but they're just fun. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep.

Okay. I need to change that. Alright. Deployable cover. What's this thing called?

There's things that have pictures that look like backpacks or satchels, but they're not. Yeah. I'm kinda thinking more along lines of, like, there's there's let me I can't I can't look it up. They're, like, with your characters when you first got them or when you first first made them, like, you all started off with, like, a adventurers pack where, it contains like a bed roll and a torch and, you know, that sort of stuff in there. I'm trying to remember what it's called.

K. Yeah. It's a new ventures pack. Okay. Focus on.

There's a sturdy satchel. That's a level two. 100. It's the only thing I can find. It's 30 gold pieces.

Orbs have some kind of vision. Right? Yeah. They've got dark vision. Yeah.

Okay. So can I get this sturdy satchel even though it's a level two of 30 gold pieces? Well, you haven't gotten a, a level two item yet anyway, so you probably could. That's the only thing that came up under container. Oh, here here it is.

Okay. So what you wanna do is go to the container section and click on the magnifying glass there. And you'll see a bunch of different ones. Some of them are level one. Container.

You have the sturdy satchel in there for sure, but there's also a sack and oil skin pouch, a horn of plenty, chest, chair, a chair for storage, a backpack. I don't know why I can't find this adventurous pack, though, so equipment. Alright. Oh, no. It's not that.

Yes. I need to buy that. Collect at least one token. Yeah. Keep getting that error too.

Okay. That's fine. We'll just do it the the hard way. No big deal. Alright.

So 10 minus 2 golds. Armor. What kind of armor? Needs it to be. Corey BDM or light, I suppose.

K. Okay. Okay. It's whatever. Alright.

I'll just go with leather then. Instead of leather, it gives you one more. One more? Armor. Yeah.

It has a lower dex cap, though. I've got four dex. I think so. Yeah. Yeah.

We got four decks, so I don't need What's that bother? I didn't but I think I could be wrong. Wouldn't be the first time. Yeah. Yeah.

It takes capital three. Yeah. Correct. Which, you know, it would be the same, but Yep. But why not maximize your your decks?

You spent so much on it. Right. Right. Right. Two gold down.

Alright. What else do we need? Oh, I probably need how does that work? I need bullets. Yeah.

You do need ammunition. I definitely need bullets. Oh, more bullets. They're not called bullets. What the heck are they called?

Yep. Jason, how are you doing with the with the, archetype feed? I've, decided not to be an assassin. Excellent. That narrows it down quite a bit.

I was liking the dual list Okay. Or the or the monk. K. You could do that. I see.

I see. You could go monk. I thought the monk, was interesting. Where did I yeah. I thought the monk was but there was a dual, a dual there was a dual that says, like, hey.

Like, just let's fight. Yep. So a little bit of disguise. I thought there was a dual weapon also, and I thought that could be a fun one. Oh, yeah.

Okay. With this guy as well, like, I could I could see that being fun. I don't know how I guess, I don't know how that would work. Because he's he's largely just going to be, like I guess, I I'm envisioning, like, potentially, for lack of better terminology, willing, like, iron gauntlets and just, like, doing a double punch, or all of a sudden, two two hammers show up, and he just, like, brings them across, you know, double double hit to the to the head or something of that nature. I could see that being kind of a fun way to run it.

If that's It's it's totally that's totally doable. I do think that you would need to switch around your attributes in order to be able to do that, though. Okay. Yeah. Because I don't have strength.

You have zero strength. Yes. Do so, like, hammer would be bludgeoning. That's obviously a strength. Is everything that's melee strength?

Not everything. I think that there are some finesse weapons that are agility, but those are like daggers and Dagger. Rapier. Yeah. Those things.

So if you're looking to smash something k. Then that's, you know, then then you're looking at strength. So I have a slot charisma. Yeah. Everybody does.

Welcome to Orbs are not known for their charismatic tactics. Yeah. So, Scott, while we're while we're waiting for other folks to kinda get caught up. There we go. Get going here.

I do have some, like, background, like, character questions that I wanna float out. Just kinda hoping to do that. Well, no. It's I don't got time for that. I just have to pick it up.

You got time for that, Chris? No. I don't got time for that. We'll we'll just have to pick it up next time. I didn't do it.

No. That's fine. Speaking of Next Time, it did occur to me that on our regular on our regularly scheduled meeting, that is the week that's the mon or that's the Tuesday after Friday's weekend. Mhmm. And I have a different game scheduled on that Monday as well.

And so that would equal to weekend away from away from my family. By two nights of gaming. Oh, by two nights of gaming. So I was curious if we had some flexibility to maybe shift for a week to the what would that be? To, like, the nineteenth instead of the twelfth, but I wasn't sure if people would be amenable to that.

I don't know what your, ICIT schedule looks like. I'm doing those Sunday nights. Okay. Yep. So that'll be ICIT.

The nineteenth, is that Wednesday? That's Tuesday. So it's the same day. It's just shifted by a week. I think I think Tuesday would be fine for me that week.

Okay. Yeah. The nineteenth. And That works for me. Okay.

Cool. Scott, would you be able to make that work too? I think so. It's my anniversary, so I don't know. What?

No. No. What? What you're saying? Dude, no.

I think so. No. I do not think so. No. Okay.

I don't think it matters. I do. Will Julie think it matters? We're not so big on all that. On the specific day, you just Okay.

Do stuff when you can do stuff. Yeah. Okay. That's fair. Well, if if if it really is okay, then you know, because, I mean, really, the reason why I'm asking for a shift is because I wanna, you know, I I I want to make sure that I get wife time.

So I don't wanna take your wife time away during your anniversary because that seems pretty lame Yeah. For my things. So Tuesday. I never do anything on a Tuesday. Fair enough.

I can ask. Throw it out there and Okay. But I thought you said Tuesdays weren't the best day for you because of being out of town or something. Or is that Well, they they are they are less of a good day for me now. But, you know, it seemed like it seemed like Tuesdays were still, like, the group's preferred day regardless.

So I was so I'm just Okay. What day it is? Yeah. Okay. Well, I mean, that and that is and that is a question as well.

Like, you know, is Tuesday still the day? I think it was more of a Clark schedule thing. Is that he he because he's got a really busy schedule, but I don't know. Doesn't make a difference to me. Okay.

Jason, you've got ICIT on Sunday. Are there any other days that are specifically not good for you? Not that I know of at this point. Okay. Yeah.

Are there any days that are specifically better for you? I well, between now and and the start of school, no. Okay. Once school starts, then things will will shift and change. Allison will stop working at her her thing so that part of our schedule will change.

I I so until until I get to the school and actually see what school is gonna look like and be like this year, I don't I don't know. And the only reason I say that is because I am I am shifting from being at Grayling High School to being down in Roscommon and Grayling High School. I just don't know Okay. Don't know if there's gonna be different expectations in different places, what that would look like. So that's Oh, yeah.

Definitely not a big deal. We'll we'll we'll just we'll just deal with what's happening before school starts, and then afterwards, we'll just kinda shift and try and try and make it work as best we can. Okay. So maybe so let's let let me let me come back around, look at my look at my schedule and that kind of thing and see if I can find see if I can find a different proposed day. And if and if that works for everybody, then maybe we'll just kinda shift it to that instead.

So I I did want to, did wanna ask before before, you know, we before we call it. Oh, and also, I know that people are still actively working on your characters. Before the next time we meet, like, let's let's try and get everything taken care of if that means that I need to take some time aside with with somebody to, you know, with you Jason to kinda help finish things off with you, I'm more than happy to do that. I will leave the, I will leave the game table on as much as possible as well so that you can so that you can just log in and work on your character if you need to. Same thing with you, Ramsey.

I know that you're, like, mid character as well. If there's a specific time where you're, like, I really wanna work on my character, and you try and log on and my computer is not up or anything, just send me a text. As long as it's not during as long as it's not during the workday and I'm not at home, then, I'll I'll turn it I'll turn it on. But I generally will try and turn off my computer, at night because we found that it helps us sleep better when we don't have electronics going on in the next room. So, but we'll we'll get that worked out.
