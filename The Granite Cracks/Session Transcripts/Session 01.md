So, yeah, what what surface creature did you track and defeat after it breached the lower halls? This could be a solo thing that you did, or you could have done it as part of a group. But it was you that were the that were rec that was recognized as the hero of the day. Sure. Sure.

Sure. That is a good question. And if anybody else has any ideas, Yes. Yes. Yes.

Collaborate. Yes. Because clearly things aren't immediately sticking out. What are some surface creatures? Mean.

Like a troll or like a a bear? I don't know if these they do exist. We're gonna go classic, Chris. Classic. Uh-huh.

It was an owl bear. Alright. What what's an owl bear? Right. It is it is exactly what it sounds like.

Yep. It is. I'm the one that owl bear is a fictional monstrous creature from Dungeons and Dragons. Yes. Does it give you a picture, Scott?

It does. I don't know if I can share it, though. Don't worry about sharing it. You know how a, a griffin is kind of like a eagle That's true. And a lion combined?

Mhmm. An owl bear is kinda like that, only not. Only not. It's like it is almost like a perfect hybrid of an owl and a bear. So it's got an owl's head, a a bear's, oh, looks like Scott is Excuse me.

Screaming something. Oh, can you see it? Because it's too small. I need to Like a bear. I'm probably on the wrong screen.

Okay. If you're in Discord Mhmm. Sucks. There's a been going. Yeah.

Okay. So Oh, okay. Alright. So Ruik, Embercloak, cracked and defeated an owl bear that threatened the, the people of Ironhold. Very cool.

Alright. Great. Job. So let's move on to Ergen. Ergen, what lost dwarven relic did you return to the temple archives?

And this can literally be anything. So it could be a weapon. It could be a ceremonial item. Mhmm. It could be, sacred texts.

I would say it would be the key because we're all from the same place. Right? Same mountainous Right. Like dwelling. Yep.

It was the lost key of, what's a cool name? Where are we at? Where's the map? Kinda like that key that, like, lets them into the mountain in the Hobbit, like the lost key of whatever our dwelling is. Does that make sense?

Of iron hold? Iron hold or maybe even Jason and I's clan. Maybe, like Mhmm. Mhmm. Something like that.

Good one. Yeah. That's brilliant. Okay. What clan are we?

So it's the last clan. Key of the Iron Mark Clan. Iron mark claim. Yes. Brilliant.

Alright. That sounds great. How much smarter than I am? What's the key Alright, Jason. The liquor cabinet?

Oh, it's key. Oh, the gold the gold liquor cabinet. The most important. It's no. No.

No. All right. So dim, Laura, your question is what expedition did you lead into the deep tunnels that returned with valuable resources? That's actually really fitting considering what we talked about. Kinda building a computer.

I like, what expedition? Yeah. Upon the discovery of, and up to that point, unknown entrance into the underdark, We let yeah. We took in a lovely little, route down in there for exploration and, reconnaissance. Alright.

That led us led us into a little foyer with some orcish type of fellows. And so yeah. I mean, I was just finding out what was down in there, and and it's, it, you know, it would have been a backdoor that we didn't know about. Awesome. So the dwarves found a backdoor to the Underdark, and Demlur led an expedition down there to discover what neighbors you guys had.

Awesome. Alright. So now moving on to the political questions. Rurik. What part of the dwarven culture do you think must change and what must never change?

That's you, Ramsey. Oh, wait. What? Sorry. I was wondering.

I was like, I think he didn't What's my name? Rurik. Holy crap. Rurik? Sorry.

Whatever. Sorry. Sorry. You you I wasn't sure if you were just thinking or I mean, kind of, but not on purpose. Because party was like, oh, that's a really good question.

How would my character answer that? Oh, yeah. Pretty good. Speaking of speaking of the liquor cabinet. Good lord.

Alright. New name. I would say, my character what must change and what must never change? My character would say that I'm still working out the details here, so, but high level I would say that the something about, and not like entirety. I'm not saying like, no the gods are bad, but like there's something about the religious structure that has to change.

Well, I'm working on that part. But what must never change is, like, the dwarven model of, like, kinship and family. K. And maybe those two were at odds for him in some way is my thought. Okay.

Sounds good. Okay. My bad. I'm sorry. I had to step away.

So Ramsey was saying that the religious something about the religious structure needs to change. Yeah. Yeah. But I'm still working on the details. But, like, I kind of already determined that, like, my, my parent parents, something, were from the, the deep shiver.

They were priests, essentially, or one of them was, and was, excommunicated for some reason. Okay. And that's kind of influenced his that's why he is himself clanless. That is that awesome. That's Thus the Praise me.

You faithless. Right. Right. Gotta find out. You were correct.

Alright. Next up, we got, Scott playing Hergan. I might just start saying Right. I don't know who I am. Used to what their name is.

Right. Hergan Anderson. You're up. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Okay. What law or custom do you quietly disagree with and why haven't you spoken out? Where are we getting these questions? Chris's big bag of random questions.

Yeah. That's right. Yeah. Do I know enough about my character's background to answer this, or are we just making random answers? You are making stuff up.

This is how you're building your background. Okay. So I didn't know if Ramsey had already made that up. Okay. Nope.

No. He just he just came in came up with it. So, you it's your it's your opportunity to, you know, put your fingerprints on, on the world a little bit and also build out your character's background a little bit. Oh. So you could totally make up a random law that your character would disagree with.

As a matter of fact, I would recommend it. And then, you know, come up with a reason why it's why he hasn't spoken out about it. What plan are we did we grow up under again? Can you just describe that real quick to me? Yeah.

So yeah. So the iron, the iron mark clan are primarily the, are primarily made out of the scouts, rangers, and border wardens. They are a clan that is very utilitarian, and, are often used in in external, in external conflicts. They're the people that are, kind of working the back lines of or working who make it make it into enemy lines and and are and are, more of like, you know, your assassin your assassin style ninja type people, as well as like the explorers who go out and find new places for the dwarven community to colonize and and spread dwarven, spread the dwarven, the dwarven culture. They are different from the black shards, which are the informant spies and covert operatives in that they're, more externally focused, and, the Black Shard are more of an internally focused clan.

However, you know, obviously, they have spies in other countries and things to it's more of a CIA thing, whereas the iron marker closer to, like, a mil more of a military style thing. Would would rangers are rangers typically married, or can they be married and have kids and stuff? They absolutely I I don't know. Can they? Yeah.

Well, I'm thinking of a law. So tell me if this tell me if this sounds stupid. I'm thinking of a law where your firstborn son has to follow in your footsteps. As far as, like, who you, like, your role in the culture community or whatever. And I don't like that because my firstborn son has a physical impairment, let's say, is one leg is longer than the other or something like that.

And so I haven't spoken out, or maybe I have to flip that around. Which one did I slightly disagree with? Am I saying anything correctly here? This is where I'm just a little bit No. That that makes Oh, I also lost perfect sense.

Yeah. So it's kinda like one of those things where you're I quietly disagree that, you know, someone can't make their own path. So like that law that you have to do your own or you have to follow in your father's footsteps. And I was either thinking that I didn't wanna follow my father's footsteps or I I'm probably protecting my firstborn son because I know the life outside is harder. Yeah.

No. That's that's perfectly legit. Yeah. I like it. And Jason Demler, why does Demler believe in the clan that the clanless deserve a voice in Ironhold's future?

That's a good question. No. That's tasteless. Yeah. Yeah.

Interesting. While recognizing the value and and having a personal affinity for the the traditions and that that sense of of honor belonging to a clan and operating within a clan, I still can recognize that sometimes those traditions prevent some of the necessary political and economic and, what's the diplomatic cutting edge ideas and policies from those who are not beholden to a specific plan and their traditions and senses of dignity and honor, etcetera. Okay. You know, sometimes they come to the table with a a mindset that while not necessarily favored, is still very utilitarian. Yeah.

Alright. Thanks for giving me an easy one. Hey. Alright. I'm not I'm not joking with that.

I really felt like that's an easy question compared to the other ones. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Alright.

So next up, I have I have some relational questions. I've got I'm I I will give you guys each two, and I'm hoping that you'll kind of work them out together here. So let's go ahead and start off. We'll we'll just continue in the same direction that we have been. So this will go with Rurik, Ambercloak, also known as Ramsey.

Mhmm. First question is what oath did you and Demlur, Jason, swear together before your first mission beyond the gates? Interesting. Good question. Beyond the gates, a Yeah.

For a voice missing beyond the gates. Okay. I will just go ahead and post it in the chat. Are you wanting both of us to to answer this, or are you really thinking that Ramsey's going to answer this? I mean, we certainly can cooperate.

Yeah. I'm thinking you work it out together. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Right. So my my first thought is just to go along go go ahead. I was gonna say, was this, like, a recognized intentional military outing, you know, like, anticipating conflict, or was this more of a, a light expedition just like, hey. Are there trees and animals out here still? Or, like, what what's the context of this mission?

Don't overthink it, Jason. Let's go with your gut. Well, given that you guys are both part of the Iron Mark Clan, it's probably some scouting expedition or something. Ma'am, these clanless. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yes. That's scope. Yeah.

You're right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But a scouting mission makes sense.

So I was thinking something along the lines of, kind of to do with me being clanless and, and your kind of take on the clanless could be something to the effect of, you know, we kinda got to talking before. Not a lot of the other people in the group would say too much to me, which, you know, I was used to. And it was just something so, you know, kind of like a, you know, watch each other's back kind of kind of deal. Mhmm. Yeah.

Like, my guys, like, yeah. I don't think anyone else out there is gonna be looking out for me. Right. Right. Right.

Yep. Perfect. Was it a blood oath? Are you spitting each other's hands? I wasn't gonna slit his hand open or anything.

As far as drawing blood, that's come to find out a pretty terrible place to do it from. Sam's are pretty useful. Exactly. Right. Right?

Yeah. Wrists are much better. Okay. There's so much more comes out. Her again.

Or Scott. Yours is, what did you and Rurick or Ramsey discover together in the deep tunnels that no one else has seen? Wow. I'm thinking something along the lines of a static goddess that we worshiped that no one has seen for years, but we've all heard the tales or something like that. Okay.

Queen of old or something. Like, they're divorced even half queens. There's something lost. I don't know. Oh, yeah.

Yeah. Sure. Absolutely could. No. No.

Just you said, like, a statue of a goddess and then something lost. So, like, like, a queen could work, but also, like, a lost goddess, like, maybe a god of the dwarves used to worship, and they don't for whatever reason anymore. Mhmm. Yeah. Because you're into the forbidden fruits.

So planless. You know? I mean, not exactly. Oh, okay. You have guns.

We are to Well, yes. I I do give you. You with his guns. All right. Next one is similar.

What did Bergen or Scott do during the cave in that saved your life? And how have you honored that moment since? Is this to Jason or me? During the, during the, It's to Jason, but you can also participate. Sure.

Explaining retribution Mhmm. Specifically during that time or at any time afterward? At any time. You have you have free reign with this question. The only guardrails I'm giving you is the question It's gotta be with in the world.

Yeah. Hurrying. Yep. There there was, a small group of us who were not on particularly good terms to begin with, at odds with one another over whether or not to to go back to the surface and try to rebuild. And at one point in time, this there was a band of us that had got caught in a a cave in, and it came to blows during that time where we were cut off from everybody else.

And, one of the, isolationists made a good solid effort. And, my dear friend, Bergen, took the bolt that was headed for my face. Right in the shoulder. Great place to get shot with a bolt. Anyway, so we got in that little tussle before we were, excavated from the the ruins there.

As far as how I've honored him with that, well, I I pressed the bolt the rest of the way through his shoulder and and got it out the backside, as as, efficiently as possible and bended the wound and supplied antibiotics as best they could in the field and eliminated the, the fellow who tried to at least kill me and, you know, wound a wound a friend. Okay. So you him right back. Yeah. We did.

And we got had we got tattoos from that day together. Yeah. That'll lead into my other cold weather tattoo, Chris. Come on. There you go.

Alright. You got Eyeball. You got Mountain. Tattoos to yeah. Tattoos to commemorate the Event.

The event. Killing of a comrade. We're not happy about that deal. Right. Yeah.

He might have left the audience in trouble. Yeah. It's like George, where's I didn't see him. Did you see him? No.

No. Everything collapsed around us. No idea where George is now. Yeah. Alright.

So, I have one more question for each of you. Are you guys good for one more, or do you wanna or do you wanna move on at this point? Real quick. Yep. Before before we do that, Jason, how do you feel about the oath stone unbroken, fortune unquenched, together we endure as the oath we took.

Forge unquenched? Mhmm. That sounds fun. Sick. Deal.

Done. Continue. Or I'm good to continue. Alright. Scott, Jason, are you good for one more?

I I think I can manage it. My imagination is running thin. I know. I know. That's why I that's why I asked.

I mean, I I got you to do a quick Four minutes. Right now. Before my imagination comes out. Better get a move on here. Alright.

Rurik, Ramsey, what invention or tactic did you develop with Hogan, or Scott that helped defend the lower hall helped defend a lower hall collapse? Collapse. Okay. So not like a battle thing. It could have been a battle.

Okay. That's a good question. Kurgan, what do you you're a ranger. Like, the question was around an invention? Yeah.

Or tactic. Or tactic. Yeah. Fighting and conquer. I do I do the inventions as well, but Oh, hang on.

I believe. Yes. Yes. We are both quite stealthy. So maybe, what do you feel, Scott?

Maybe we like were able to sneak around and, like, flank whatever. As soon as you said tactic, I started thinking battle. Like, we were able to sneak around and flank, like, whatever. The dragon? Kind of force.

Maybe not a drag. I think it's like goblins or something. Yeah. But we were able to, like, get around behind and kind of, like, take out their leadership or communication or you know what I mean? Well, not communication if it's goblins, but they have leaders.

They have leaders. Yep. I don't know. That's that's that's that was my first thought. And that was to prevent what, Chris?

I because I can't see the oh, no. Sorry. Sorry. It's in the chat. Sorry.

So if you need to from collapse. Yep. So maybe Alright. I was thinking cave in the whole time. Yeah.

Could could be that maybe Maybe it was a yeah. Maybe it was a goblin force that was trying to create a choke point by, blowing up a portion of one of the lower hulls, and you guys got to their leadership before, you know, before they were able to do it, you know? Mhmm. Coordinated efforts. Yeah.

Got it. Like it. Dwarf team six over here. You're right. Yeah.

Do you have a sniper rifle with a silencer on it? No. Very no. Alright. Scott, your your next one is what battle did you and Demler or Jason fight side by side in that forge your bond?

So we're outside. We'll call it the battle of the drunken cave. Alright. And then we Mhmm. We just Jason and I took on a whole scout team that was half drunk and destroyed them all so they could not report back.

Okay. An orc scout team or dwarven or Yep. No. Orc scout team. Or Alright.

I can You by chance. Who are the ones that we're battling in the other game, like the goblins or something, you know? Yeah. Goblins work as well. There are lots of there are lots of things that are in the deep the deep darkness there.

Alright. Last one. Daimler. What mission did you and Rurik, Ramsey, complete together that earned you both a commendation from the king? Yeah.

Our initial expedition there where we kinda had our our first, bonding, the the shared oath, that expedition. We went out, during that expedition. The crew that we were with was overrun and outflanked by a a troop of, of orcs. And, Rourke and I were able to sneak through a hole in the line, which allowed us to get in behind and and break some of the, machinations that the orcs were using that were pinning the pinning the whole team down pretty severely. Okay.

And we're able to, break the offense up enough that the rest of the team was able to, get out of that out of that situation. Didn't didn't win the battle, but, would have otherwise been extinguished. The entire team would have been lost. Okay. So you basically saved your platoon by by going, by going maverick a little bit and made it back alive.

And for that honor or for that for that heroic effort, you received a commendation from King Harker. Sounds good to me. Love it. Alright. Well, there we are.

So we have finished character creation. I know it took us a little bit, but, I I I just really wanted us to have built up at least a little bit of an idea about who our character who your characters were before we jumped right into it. So, thank you for humoring me. I think this was a beneficial, exercise. So thanks a lot.

Yep. Also, just wanted to give you guys at least a little bit of a heads up on all the clickables on the screen here. If you click on the individual individual dwarf pictures that will just produce a larger sized picture of each of your each of your dwarf photos, each of your dwarf pictures. If you click on the names, then that will open up the character sheets of those individual of those dwarves, you all should have you all should be able to see each other's, character sheets. The party opens up the party sheet, like it did with, in the other game.

NPCs will open up a list of known NPCs that you have, with brief descriptions of who they are and and what and what they do. Maps will open up a map of Solaris, showing you where you are in the map. If you do click on the map and you click on the back button that's in the upper left hand corner or change back to the, to the original, landing page, you may notice that, you'll you lose your navigation stuff in there. I think that's kind of a bug with v with version 13. So, at the moment, so really the fix for that is just refresh the screen and everything will come back.

So Where where is the the map you're talking about here? Button map button or whatever. So, you know, on this on the main screen here on the right hand side, if you scroll out there, maybe maybe, you can see maps. I'm sorry. Thanks.

Yep. Okay. Those buttons there. Okay. Yep.

Those buttons. Quests will open up the quest tracker like it did when the other game, and the story will open up a journal with, with all of the, with kind of all I'm going to be including all of the, all of the what happened last time session notes and things in there. So, you can go back and check on that. So I've got all that stuff for you to be able to kinda mess around with, play with, and that kind of thing. But I I do, I do wanna make sure that if there is anything that, anything that you have to click through to get to, or it would be convenient if there was just a button on the screen, feel free to ask for it.

I'm more than open to adding additional buttons or removing some of these things that you just don't find useful. As long as, you know, a majority of the group, you know, agrees in its uselessness or its or its usefulness. So, but more than happy to change the navigation around if if that if that's helpful. Okay. So now let's go ahead and start off.

So so here we here we go. Deep in the heart of the Northern Stonefang Mountains, in the Fortress Of Ironhold, you are a champion among the dwarves. You, a champion among the dwarves, have been summoned. The summons comes quietly, no fanfare, no banners, just a just a sealed scroll and and a time. You are led through the quieter halls of Iron Hold, past forges and council chambers into a part of the mountain few have ever seen.

The stone here is older, darker, carved with runes that predate the current age. In a private chamber, King Harbron deep mantle waits surrounded by a handful of trusted advisors. That is the the meeting room. Within that room, you recognize each of the individuals by site and name. They are very, they they are big, movers and shakers in the in the world, in the world of iron hold.

First off, to King Hargren's right is Belgrin Deepdelve. Belgrin is a, is the king's, Elgarin is the senior scholar of Ironhold and advisor to the king. He has shown himself to be nothing but loyal to the king and his interests. Next to him is Bromley storm Bromley storm guard. I will eventually be able to say words.

Bromley is the defender of the throne and commander of the king's shield. He is a he is well known within military circles as one of the best champions in the, in in Iron Hold. On the other side of the table is Varic Silver Vein. You're actually somewhat confused to see you very in this, in this space as he has not necessarily been the, most supportive of King Hargren's, royal subjects. He is next in line for the for the throne and is, and while he does, he does he always does the quote unquote right thing, Sometimes there's a little bit of a sometimes there's there are rumors of of him taking taking shots at the king when the king isn't when the king isn't looking kind of thing.

Nothing nothing has straight up manifested from it. However, he is, he's definitely not considered to be one of King Hargrean's or King Deepmantle's, most loyal. And next to him is, is Maehla Blackshard. She may not look like much, but she is the is one of the, elders of the, Blackshard, clan, which is and the chief spymaster to the king. And then there's, of course, King Hargreht himself.

He's a wise, old dwarf who has seen many years and many battles. It was his decisive thinking and his decisive action that saved all of iron hold from the flaming retribution and sealing the mountain and waiting out the waiting out the era. In more recent days, he has been seeking to see the see the surface and see what is, see what is left of the world of of a theory after the flaming retribution. He has since he he has started to send out colonies and, and explorers, and, and again, this is something that some of Ironhold likes, some of Ironhold does not like. There are some that believe that the surface is cursed and do not wish to return to it, while others wish to see what kind of, what situation the surface is in and, how dwarven culture and dwarven, heritage, can help the help the world now.

So as you come in, as you walk in, you're escorted in individually. You all come from different places and are escorted in separately. As you walk into that room with all five of those, dwarves that are known throughout the city, you find yourself looking at, looking at each other as well. Is there any specific, physical descriptions that you guys want to give, any more than just the images that are on the screen? So it's just random day.

We just get a note. Hey. Come to the like, this wasn't a preplanned thing. Correct. Alright.

Sick. So Rurik, is 100% hungover. Okay. He's like, buy my beard. Is that the time?

Right. Right. Right. Who hold sessions in these hours? Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Also, something I think you both of you would know, since, we have Ben on mission together is one of Rurik's items, allows him to essentially walk around seemingly unarmed and although he is basically always armed and armored. And so he just looks like he's in some street clothes, and probably some actual street street clothes.

Okay. Perfect. So, Demler, what is your general disposition? How are you coming into how are you coming into this this meeting? I'm assuming based on our history, commendations from the king, that I've I have been in these parts before.

So it's not like I'm unfamiliar with the the surroundings of the environment. Otherwise, a little off put by the suddenness and apparent secrecy of the the summons and all that good jazz. There's a certain level of discomfort, I guess. And, so, you know, fairly somber face until I see Rurik stumble in, and then you'll see Dimler give a good little chuckle and, None of the, what might be typical floating iron, none of none of those immaterial substances. Nothing, you know, on display there at all.

Okay. So just, Alright. Trying to keep the tears from staining my eyeballs and cheeks Okay. As it appears on crying through cat claws. Alright.

And, Hurgen, how do you contact yourself in as you walk through the door? I'm pretty stoic, I imagine. Honor the king with the head head bow. Was it the queen that was there too? Who's the lady again?

I So she's the spy pictures. The spy master? Okay. Oh, this is Honor the king. Spell.

Black there? Okay. Him leery eye, if you Okay. Can you hear me? But honor and stand there and kind of and say shield Rurik, but kinda stand in front of the king's view to him, I guess, to to shield him and maybe prop him up a little bit.

You just to make sure that he doesn't look too completely drunk. Right. It'll make it harder to see when he falls over because he passed out. After after Hargan walks through the door and does does what he does, the king stands to his feet and the rest of the, the rest of the council stands with him. And he says, Demlure, Rurik, and her again, I'm glad that I I'm glad to see you again.

Please have a seat. And he motions to three open chairs at the table. And then yep. Yep. Just sit down.

I go sit down. Alright. Cool. As you all sit. Oh, go ahead.

No. Go ahead. Okay. As you all sit down, the king looks looks around, sees Rurik, and and makes, and and has more of an indulgent smile than anything. He is very clearly not offended at, at his drunken state, but it's more like a a hungover.

Right. Right. Yes. Fair enough. Good.

Yeah. But he's but it's just kind of like one of those one of those like you like a a grandfather just, you know, smiling at smiling at his grandson sort of thing. It's just like, yeah, this guy. And he says, I I welcome you again, and I thank you for coming at short at such short notice. I'm calling you I called you into these secret chambers because there is something that I need and I need it to be secret.

As you know, we have two we have dwarves of two different minds in Ironhold. We have the, isolationists and the expansionists. As you know, I have been employ I've been sending colonies out into the surface world to go find places, reestablish dwarven dwarven, culture and and bring, and bring some or bring some order to the chaos. One of one such place was the colony of, was the colony of Dagger's Sheath. And he pulls out and he motions to the map in the in the center, and, you see the iron hold in there.

And then he points to the south along the, along the stone, the Stonefang Mountains. And a distance down there, there's a, another town or spot in the map labeled Dagger Sheath. He says, this was one of our oldest colonies, one of the first to go out. They have not sent they they have not given us a check-in in over a month, which is not common for them. My, my hope is to discover what has happened to Dagger Sheath Now I can't send an army down there.

I can't send a contingent. I can't be open about it because if any wind of anything going awry came out about the colonization project, then that would give far too much credence to the isolationist faction. So as each of you has proven yourself to me personally, and to the greater, the greater group, the greater iron hold itself. It was my hope that you would do me this favor and go down to Dagger Sheath and determine what, if anything, has happened to them and where, and what and if there is and if something has happened to tell to determine what to determine what did it. As far as I know from the last communications that we we have from them, there was nothing awry.

They were, they were a small mining village that that had been building that had been building some iron mines into the mountains, refurbishing some older mines that were already present. No, no problems as far as I could tell. Uh-huh. So that is, that was their last report. So before I give any more information, my first question must be must be, answered.

Will you take this take this challenge and accepts and in return, you would have, the gratitude of your king and any boon that I might be able to give to you? Is there anything on this table other than that map, Chris? Currently, no. Okay. I'll say Rurik, as the king was talking like, he's paying attention, but, you know, he's he has, like he took out, his bar of soap, and he has, like, a little whittling knife, and he cut off a bit of it.

And he's, like, been making this little, like, figure, little dwarf looking figure out of a bit of soap, and he's kind of, like, marching it you know, playing with it, essentially, like, marching it on the map a little bit. He, at that, he kinda, like, kinda parks up a little bit and cocks his head. He's like, any boom? Careful. Any boon that I can provide.

Ah. Any boon with a thinner reason, my friend. There's a, there's a lot that I can reason, regardless, Like kind of a little bit of elbow in the arm. Like quick, Jack. I, I kinda look at my my two other companions, kinda see where where where they're thinking.

But Rourke will say, oh, I don't I don't like the outside much, but if, if some dwarves in trouble, I I'll I'll go. Yeah. I think I would stand up and kinda whatever the or not say whatever the king wishes, but, you know, maybe say as the king wishes or something like that. Okay. So, you know, just truly showing yourself as a king's man right there.

Right? Yep. That kind of thing. I'm trying to say as little as Awesome. Possible.

Yep. When do we need to leave? As soon as you can as soon as arrangements can be met, This does seem to be a bit of a time sensitive thing. While we haven't heard from them in a month, their check-in was, their scheduled check-in was, only a few days ago. So anything could have happened within that month time period or it could be happening right as we speak.

What task does do we oh, go ahead. Yeah. I was just asking what the scale on this map is. Like, if I'm looking at this and I'm going, this is a one day, this is a two day walk or so as far as walk is concerned, this is, like, a month. Right?

However, unlike your characters in, unlike your characters to the south, you actually have a dwarven, you actually have a fully functioning dwarven city that has animal husbandry and all kinds of things going on there. You are able to, the the king will happily provide you with some riding goats to make your way across the mountains. And with said goats, you are looking at probably about a week's journey, to to make it to Dagger Sheath. Gotcha. Slap.

Madam Black Shard, have you any further information that could be of value? We have not heard, of anything in that direction. However, to the north, we have button rumblings of some caves, some cave entrances that were, one size when passed and then quite a different size when returned. Not sure if that has anything to do with this. Our eyes and ears are not as readily available outside of Ironhold as they once were, but, we are definitely looking, to get some forward information from you should you, should you find it.

And to that end, she pulls out a what looks to be a piece of parchment paper. And she gives that to probably Hargren, And she said and what you receive, so you can go ahead and drag and drop that parchment of direct message that is in the, in the chat. Pull that onto your character sheet. She hands that over to you and says, this is a way to be able to keep us informed as far as what you find as you're navigating the navigating the wilds. And naturally, as we discover more on our end, we will be more than happy to share what information we can that would be pertinent to your quest.

Hey, Chris. Is there a way to pull up all those pictures that you put up? That's always a question I've had. After you close them, is there a way to get back to them for us? Well, the best way to do that would be to go back to the, go back to the cracked granite landing screen and click on NPCs.

And in in there, there will you'll have the pictures and, brief description of of not only those NPCs, but any of the others. Yeah. And with the, with that, Algren also chimes and says, We've searched with our divination magic and there doesn't seem to be any way for us to be able to penetrate the the veil of dagger sheath, which is another cause for alarm. Typically, we do not have have trouble finding, seeing the, seeing our colonies and making sure that they're doing well. But for some reason, we've been running into some static with, with this specific, with this specific village, almost as if there was some sort of magnetic interference or something like that.

But, from what we can tell, the, the road to Dagger Sheath, we have not had any such issue, and the road itself appears to be relatively safe or as safe as roads can be these days. So I do not expect that you will run into any problems along the way, but, it's never a bad idea to be cautious as you travel. Don't you worry about that. I kinda elbow dem lore a little bit. He's good at penetrating all kinds of sheaths.

He chuckles Yep. And grimaces. Wish that wasn't public information. No, man. Varrick also kind of pipes up at this point and says, after after a, after an inappropriate polite laugh from the, from from the the from the dwarven, nobles.

It's not it's not like, you know, it's a polite, you know, I'm expected to laugh at this, so I'm going to laugh sort of thing. They, Varrick said Veric says, this village is vitally important to our security. It's what holds our southern border and keeps it and keeps it safe from the wilds of of of Solaris. They have kept us they they have kept us safe for the past year. They have had they have fought many a beast and have tamed that portion of, that portion of the Iron Hold, of the Iron Hold territory, and we cannot lose them.

We cannot lose that security. We will be left we will be quite literally caught with our pants down should anything choose to choose to attack us from that in from from the South. And it is more likely that there would be any there would be problems with the, it's more likely that, you know, we would that there are more enemies in the South than the North as there isn't much north of us. So I would encourage you to speed along your way to find what has happened to this place. As, as as he's talking, when he when he says, caught literally with our pants down, I kinda, like, lean over to to her again and say, nah.

Now they're just making it too easy for me. And as he and as he finishes and and says, you know, like, you know, hurry or whatever, like, we're just kinda like, oh, oh, alright. Then grab my pack off the ground and start to stand up. Right. K.

Yeah. I look around. I go. I might jump in the gun a little bit. Well, you might be or you might not.

What Perkin and Demler, what are you guys doing at this point? What just happened? I lost pretty much everything. Oh, refresh. Yeah.

I should do that. Yeah. I I just I just moved you guys back to the for some reason the for some reason the, I don't know why, but the map scene just kinda causes a big snafu when you move back from it. Oh, yeah. There we are.

Cool. I I did grab the parchment of direct message. Okay. If nobody else did. I did too.

Yeah. I thought I was supposed to. Perfect. Either one of you is perfectly fine. It's basically the partial direct message allows you to send a short message to the person who has the partner piece of it.

So you basically pull out the parchment, you talk to it, give it a brief message, and then it will distribute that message to the to the to the person that has the the sister Parchment. So Have we ever been to this other place? The I Dagger Sheath? If if you want to have been from or if you want to have been there, then you can totally have been there. If not, then no.

Like, you're that I I I don't see a problem either way. Yeah. Because I'm feeling like at least we, Jason, and I have been out and about. Right? So Well, I mean I've seen that for everybody.

Yeah. At the very least, like, hurricane could probably has probably been there. I would I would venture to say, just based off of kind of, like, you know, some of the some of the stuff going on and, you know, your your class and kind of your, your clan. Like, I I would expect you guys to have been, the most important thing. There before, and I've taken orders from the king before, I'm assuming.

So it's kinda like Although you guys yeah. You have taken orders from the king before, although usually it's with a little bit more pomp and circumstance and not nearly as, like, cloak and dagger is what you're currently having happen. Right. This is a bit bit of a new experience for you. Okay.

Yeah. I think I'm ready to go, but just, you know, wondering who was talking before? Was it the king, or was it the old the head of the guard, or was it the old guy? So the person that was basically had had that air of authority and was basically telling you, you need to go down there as quickly as possible. This is this is guarding our southern our southern border and, you know, blah blah blah.

Blah. That was that was very, silver vein. The ambitious the ambitious second in line noble to be king. Yep. Are we used to taking orders from him?

Because I'm used to taking orders from the king, so I'm questioning in this a little bit. What does he know that we don't You Yeah. You are used to taking orders from the king. You don't usually you aren't usually in the same sphere as Varrick. Varrick has a very different crowd that he, that he interacts with.

So you don't really know him all that well. You you usually interact with with King Hargren or King Deep Mantle, I should say. So I guess in that sense, I would step in, look at the king in the eye, and say as the king wishes, and make sure he still wishes it. So okay. So you look pointedly at the king and after he gives his whole spiel, you look pointy pointedly at the king and say and say as the king wishes to which, those of you that are paying attention, Varric gets a little flustered by this, but the king steady as always, looks you directly in the eye and says, that is my wish.

Go and, and, be as fast as Quicksilver. Stands gives a short bow. Alright. So you guys all exclude all excuse yourself from the, from from the chamber, you start walking back, you are escorted by guards as this is more of a super secret space. So they don't let people just walk around.

As you are leaving, after a few minutes of go of navigating through some some hallways and and that kind of stuff, you find yourself, face to face with Bramley Stone Guard, the only person in the, in the chamber that did not speak. He looks at the three of you and says, I have a word of caution for you. The king does not suspect, but his his counselors have been compromised. His councils have been, they they've given ill information. I would strongly recommend that you be on your guard as you go on this on this quest.

It may not be at what you think, may not be what the king thinks. I don't know what it would be, but I do know that the court is not as safe for a deep mantle as it once was. Be careful. That's appreciated. And with that, he, you know, kind of waves you on, with that cryptic warning.

Sir Yes. Eric seemed rather anxious for our departure. Yes. That was noted. I fear that I'm concerned that that might have implication for the king.

I I fear that you may be right. The king has fewer friends than he once had and fewer than he knows. The fact that the three of you have stayed loyal to him in the midst of all of this political upheaval has meant quite a deal, quite a bit to him. And we will make and I will do my part, and the king's shield will do its part. But I would say, don't stay away too long.

You may be needed closer to home. Kurt smile and a head nod. Right? Strength and honor. Yep.

Strength and honor. Alright. So you guys head back, head back to your domiciles, whatever they may look like, or be heading back to your family. You got you have the rest of the day. It's about noon.

You have the rest of the day to prepare for your, for your trip, but you will be, the expectation is that you'll be leaving tomorrow at sunrise. What are you gonna do in the meantime? We'll start with her again. What are you gonna do in the meantime? Say grab some protein bars and some beef jerky, Probably give a drink with, I don't know.

I probably go back to my family, explain what must be done, pack up and get a good night's sleep. Well, your family does seem disappointed that it is that you're going to be leaving them for a time. They are not unfamiliar with, you leaving for extended periods of time as this is part of your position. So they're sad, but understanding. Yeah.

Jason. We're supposed to leave first thing tomorrow morning. I would suggest first thing is midnight o one. Leaving in the middle of the night. Okay.

Just to, I guess. Not be as anticipated. Okay. Everybody have qualms. You do Dwarves have dark vision.

Dark vision. Yeah. Okay. It looks like Yeah. You yeah.

Yep. It doesn't yeah. You guys are you guys don't have any problem seeing in the middle in pitch black. The only thing with with dark vision is that instead of seeing color, you see in black and white, but that's about it. Okay.

While it's pitch dark, to clarify, we still see in color when there's light. Fair enough. Yes. You can see all the light. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. So we just wanna point it by for everybody. But yeah. But it's it's kinda like, night vision goggles, only no goggles. Right.

Start peepers. Yep. Excuse me. I would I would like to just kinda throw the slip on the whole thing. K.

So I I wouldn't I wouldn't communicate that in the context of of the guards. I, I'm guessing that it doesn't much matter where we go, that, Adam Blackshard is is trying to listen. I don't want her knowing, or her peeps knowing. That that'll be harder said than done. Yep.

Yeah. That would be my counsel, with as as the three of us are are maybe chatting before we we take off. Yeah. I mean, you got time to get a, a nap in and and get things packed and and stuff. But if if you guys would agree to that, I think it would be wise to shake it up.

The sooner we get out, the sooner we get back, hopefully. I'm ready whenever. I've just got one thing to do, and that sounds good. Alright. Right.

And, Rurik, what what is that one thing you gotta do? Yeah. Rorick is gonna go to his favorite, restaurant tavern, whatever. He's gonna have one last good meal. Right.

And then, as he's leaving dragon ribs? So lousy. Yeah. Yeah. Just just out of just out of curiosity, what's the name of his favorite restaurant?

That is a good question. So I'm thinking it's gonna be, like, not like a posh place, but not, like, super rundown. It was probably definitely just, like, a tavern somewhere. It can be No. No.

No. No. No. No. No.

That's not gonna work. It's a little place called the Forges Fire. That seems good. They they specialize in, like, barbecue. Barbecue owl bear.

Alright. I don't get so many of those. I had it once, though. Thanks to me. As, as as I'm leaving, I will, take, like, I'm imagining they have, like, like, the the coasters, you know, that have the the name of the place on it.

You know, maybe these aren't like cardboard or whatever. Maybe they're, like, carved out of wood or something. But I will, pocket one of those, and I will trade it, for that little soap statue I carved. I will leave that on the table. Okay.

Yeah. So the coaster itself is actually it's actually a piece of, a piece of shale rock that they that they carve out of. So it's kind of like this nice, well, not nice, but it's it's a flat piece of shale that, they've fashioned into coasters. So Excellent. Sweet.

Alright. Cool. Cool. Cool. Alright.

So you guys go back, take care take care of your stuff at your houses and and, you know, have your have your last meal, pack up on protein bars and and, and and, beef sticks, maybe maybe a few quest bars in there and, that kind of stuff and, some some granola, you know, all the good stuff. And then you all, meet at the gates of Ironhold, at 12:01, to leave in the dead of night. The next week goes by pretty, pretty uneventfully. Outside of a few, outside of a few encounters with, a couple of a couple of, wildlife situations, you know, mountain lions, that kind of stuff, which generally you were able to kind of scare them off and that kind of thing. Nothing really ever came to blows.

You do make it to make it to Dagger's Sheath, in a little under a week's time as you were doing more of a forced march, with your animals. You were you were restricted by what your animals could handle, but you definitely were able to get through there, a lot quicker. Let me see. So after a little under a week's travel, through the mountain passes and silent valleys you crest the final ridge Below the colony of Dagger Sheath lies in ruins buildings shattered stonework scorched and no signs of life. The air is thick with ash and silence.

The only sounds are wind and the creak of broken timber. What do you do? That's encouraging. Panic and run. It's the only sensible thing to do.

Wow. Maybe the isolation I probably would say this isn't what it used to be. Something's wrong. Can't quite put my finger on it. Yeah.

Captain Hopkins. Oh my gosh. Oh, being the ranger that I am, I think I would start to decipher the situation, try to find some tracks leading in and out. You said the timber's burning? Broken.

Broken. Not burning. Was charred, though. It's the creek of broken timber. Nothing is currently burning.

Although there is kind of an evidence of burning. But So there is ashes, you said. Right? Right. So okay.

Mhmm. You're wanting to Yeah. What happened? Do some investigation, looking for tracks and that kind of a thing. So in order to be able to do that, again, I need a survival role from you.

Rurik, what what are you going to be doing while he's poking around for tracks? That is a good question. What is Rurik gonna be doing? I think Veric is gonna do what Veric does best. Find a good, excuse me, find a good place, to, both hide and to keep a lookout.

Okay. So go ahead and roll me a stealth and then a, and then a perception. Awesome. And, Demalore, what are you doing? What Video.

Does what what does nature as a core skill do? Nature is specifically more of a, it's a knowledge skill sort of thing. So it's kind of the it's the classic thing between D and D survival and nature. Survival is like street smarts of of the woods, and nature is book smarts of the woods. Okay.

So can I do a a nature thing where I'm I'm just I am looking at the natural surroundings? Not necessarily trying to do, like, a I don't know. Anyway, I guess I'm looking for anything in nature that that seems to be out of place, not where it belongs, or maybe things are missing that should be there. Okay. Is that a Alright.

So role, or is that more of a survival check still? I think that would still fall under survival. Nature would be, like, if you notice something and you don't and you're trying to identify, like, what that thing is, that might be a that would be more of a nature rule. So I would, you could use your perception instead of survival as well if you're just trying to notice things that are out of place. So Yeah.

I mean, that's kinda why I'm maybe I'm doing more like a, yeah, search or, something like of that nature. Just Yeah. That's what what's in the area. Yeah. No.

That that that totally works. So, yeah, I would roll perception for that. It's either perception or survival, just depending. Alrighty. I have a perception that is not, initiative.

So that's the one I would be rolling. Right. And it's all set up. I just roll it. Right.

Oh. That's like Look at you guys. The highest rolls ever. Maybe the highest roll ever. Maybe you should just stop playing stop playing sorcerers because that's what's screwing you up.

Oh, boy. Alright. I have a beef against sorcerers. That's that's it. So, Hergan, you are looking around trying to see if you can locate some tracks and things.

You don't, so you don't you aren't able to really track anything, but you do definitely notice that there are some tracks that are, hanging around inside the actual dwarven village itself. The reason why you notice these tracks over any other tracks is the sheer size of them. These tracks are easily the size of a full dwarf, lying down on the ground. So you you, like, you you're not able to figure out where they're going, where they're coming from, but you'll but you're kinda like looking around and that kind of thing, and it's just like huge footprint kind of thing. Just a dwarves, though.

Nothing else? Well, you've got dwarf footprints, then you've you well, you've got dwarf sized footprints. I can't say you can't say for certain that the footprint that the other footprints aren't aren't something else. But then there you've got dwarf size footprints and then you've got footprints that are the size of the dwarf. Oh, I see what you're saying.

Uh-huh. I thought Yeah. So that's what you're able to exactly. Like, you're you're not like, even though you rolled really low, there's no way that you would be like, I wonder what's going on here. This is very weird.

You know? It's like there there there are some really big footprints in there. Rurik, you find yourself a good sentinel position, kind of over overlooking the, overlooking the, the village. Uh-huh. And you really aren't able to, see any threats or anything happening.

The village itself seems pretty, pretty tame. Or not tame, but, like, quiet. You do kind of notice as you're looking, it's like it's the the wildlife doesn't appear to be as readily available here as it typically is elsewhere. So it is like while it is quiet, it's almost like a little bit too quiet. It's not like there's no nature sounds.

It's just it's not as vibrant as what as as what you were what you've been used to just traveling over the past week. And Demler. So some of the things that you noticed just investigating the town and looking around, is that the dwarves, is that the, the village itself, there are bodies here, but there aren't as many bodies as you would expect. There are definitely, like, dwarf, they're definitely dwarf soldiers that were killed in very grotesque ways. In a lot of in a lot of cases, like, just kinda looking at them, it seems like they were just kinda squished kinda thing.

In in like, basically, like, the their, like, their their heavy armor basically just compacted in on their on on them and basically just kinda, like, yeah. Just kinda like s sardine can, like just kinda squeezed squeezed in. So you've you see that, you see a few a few of them kind of, you know, cut in half and that kind of stuff. Really grotesque, style things. Like, nobody's just like dead with like a an an arrow in their in their neck.

It's like just completely, like, brutalized bodies is what you're saying. Anything in particular that you're trying to find while you're looking around the, looking around the village, Jason? Yeah. I guess, if there's, like, yeah, any any clues that would help identify what this was? Was this intelligent fighting?

Was this this mindless brutality, you know, berserkers Yeah. The hell's a little thing or So yeah. So for that yeah. So, Jason, I would, ask you to do a recall knowledge rule for that. And basically, what you need to do is on your macro bar there in the first level spot, there's a little black box that has a gold triangle in it or a gold rectangle, a gold action image in there.

You click on that. Look in? At the bottom in your on your character, on your character HUD. Okay. Main screen at the bottom.

Yeah. There's a black yeah. So there there's a there's a black box that has a, that has a gold, like, action marker in it. You see it? I do not see anything with the gold action marker at all.

In on the macro bar? I don't see any colors on any of that. I thought I added it to your macro bars, but maybe Yeah. I don't And so all my regular boxes are empty. So okay.

So what I what so this is what we're gonna do real quick. If you go to your compendium pack, there's on the right hand side, this is everybody. On the right hand side of the screen, there's a little book that has a little world in it's compendium packs. Mhmm. You click on that and you go to the p f two e workbench.

Mhmm. Thing, like section. You click on that, it'll expand. And then there's a the one that's on the the the the, and they've got a bunch of things with a bunch of different words. Pick the pick the third line item or the last line item in there.

Alright. So And I'm sorry. I'm I'm not sure that I'm following you here. So on the on the right hand side of the screen where we've got our message and encounters, actors, We've got items, journal Underneath that. Labels Right.

Macros, music, but, you know, compendium packs. That's where you wanna be? Compendium packs. That's where you wanna be. Yep.

And inside there you'll see one of the headers that's labeled p f two e workbench. Okay. And if you click on that, that'll expand and inside that, there's one that's labeled p f two e workbench macros. Okay. It should be the last one on the on the list.

Mhmm. You click on that, it'll open up, thing and there there's a basic action macros button or basic action macros in there. I want you to click and drag that onto your macro bar. K. And then if you click that, that should open up a dialogue that has a bunch of, like, skills and things in it.

Mhmm. Indeed. That it does. Okay. Inside there, on the third column, there's a recall knowledge button or recall knowledge option, and I want you to click that.

There we go. Alright. Just just Jason? Alright. Yeah.

Just Jason at this point. I have all kinds of questions. He rolled so high yeah. Because he rolled so high on his perception check, he, you know, he got the opportunity to do this. So okay.

So going by what you have here. Okay. What you've seen with how these dwarves were beaut were brutalized. What was pointed out to you from Hurgan with, like, these jute with these, like, large footprints. And, and the stories that you've heard, the ancient stories that you've heard.

There's something out of a legend that is that is, that is the only explanation as to what happened here. And you all and it almost seems crazy because these creatures have been extinct for over a thousand years. But the only explanation is that the is that this town was attacked by giants. They've been extinct for a thousand years. Right.

The dwarven the the pre the Iron Hold had a had a had a, had what was referred to as the Giant Wars. And in that time, as anybody who grew up in Ironhold knows, during that time, the giants were a very brutal and and, desperate race. The giant tribes looked to, take over the dwarven territory, but the dwarves fought hard and were able to not only push the giants back, but because of the brutality of the giants and their relentless assaults, the only answer that the dwarves had had to come to was destroying the entire, destroying the entire race. Because if they didn't they would just keep coming back. And that was what you were taught.

So according to you, giants no longer exist. But what you're looking at right now looks like you may have been mistaken. Looks like you'd be like we've been mistaken. Could these be the stone giants? K.

Maybe. You told me to look in the NPCs, and I looked in the NPCs. Was there was there stone giants in oh, the no. There Grandad, Earthcrawler. That's a dwarf.

Oh, says he's a legendary stone giant. Oh. Oh. Maybe maybe I'll maybe I maybe I lied. Maybe he is a stone guy.

Maybe he is a stone guy. Maybe he is a stone guy. Alright. But that's what you're that's what you're able to that's what you're able to figure out. So So as as Herndon and I are are walking through things, you know, Eric is setting up his his post about we're kinda starting around, and we're we're chatting this out.

And, yeah, I'm just I just kinda keep saying a little bit. It can't be. Looks it looks like giants. It looks like giants. And you can just tell he's, like, trying to process that and and deal with the cognitive dissonance that that is is creating.

Alright. And, any Hurgen, do you have any response to I would just keep saying it can't be, but nothing else makes sense. Alright. As you guys are as you guys are doing your investigating and different different things here, work as the person with with kind of like the overarching view of the, of the the the Overwatch position. I have to step aside for a second and make sure my kids are doing good with getting in bed and all that jazz.

So Uh-huh. Okay. Five minutes out. You guys do your thing. Uh-huh.

Fair. You notice, in the distance towards the mines, you see some what looks to be kind of like some fresh smoke billowing out. As you sift through the ruins a faint sound also echoes from the direction of the mines, you hear a monstrous skittering noise as well as seeing the smoke. Well, I don't, I don't know nothing about no giants, but there's something in the mind, and it ain't happy. I'll I'll call out to my companions.

I think it's maybe coming this way. Alright. Ergen, you you get that call from Rurik. And, what what is your response? I would probably grab Demlar, do an athletics check, and get behind the pillar.

Alright. As we try to get closer and closer with Rurik as kind of our bird's eye view. Alright. So you grab Move from pillar to pillar. I think I'm seeing, like, pillars and things.

Right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. You can definitely find cover and that kind of stuff and make your way back to where Rurik is, or at least where you think he is. He's made himself very, very difficult to spot.

But, yeah, you can you can basically make it back to where he's at. As you guys sit there, you basically wait in anticipation. You don't see any like, you hear the skittering, doesn't appear to be coming closer. It's kind of like a like, that kind of a sound only a lot, a lot louder than that, because it can carry all the way from the mind, but it doesn't appear to be approaching. Okay.

Well, well Gotta investigate. We're supposed to find out what it is. I don't think creepy noises coming from the mine is gonna be good enough. So for that boon, let's go. Alright.

Let's demonstrate. Are these your crew's Are we approach? With or Alright. So you guys head back to, or head over towards the mine. Yeah.

How's your approach going to be? It's pretty good. Classic things. Alright. At least for me.

I can see you guys. Yep. The the tracks are too big to go rushing in. Somehow, we have three dwarves, and we're all trained in stealth. I don't know what happened, but I'm kinda here for it.

Yeah. No. It's it's this is this is crazy. Dwarven infiltration team was not quite what I had in mind, but it's it's pretty sick. I I know what happened.

Yeah. Okay. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna use gonna do a party role, I think. K. A group check for this.

Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So trying to trying to remember exactly how that works here. We'll just go ahead and Ramsey, we'll we'll just go ahead and have you roll it. Sure.

I'm I'm back. Sorry. Yeah. Okay. You're good.

Alright. Stealth stealth. Bam. I rolled a number. Okay.

It's probably good. It's awesome. Yeah. You you are pretty awesome. So and I think there was, like, a follow the expert or something in there.

But, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know what it sounds, but, yeah, it's true. All the expert.

Yeah. All of the expert. Here we go. He's now attempting the reoccurring skill check while exploring, such as climbing or performing different exploration tactics, like avoiding notice. Seems like what we're doing.

I must be an expert. You are an expert. While following the expert, you you match the tactic or attempt a similar skill check. Thank you for, okay. So everybody else, so I will need a stealth role from everybody else.

But if you choose to be following the expert on this, you will get a plus two bonus to your stealth role. We're good. I'm choosing to. Do I have to do anything for the role, or you're just gonna add two to it? You'll need to add two to it, but, if you do the if you roll stealth, you'll get a dialogue in here, and then all that you need to do is just, is just where there's a modifier and this is plus one, just change that to plus two and click add, and that should give you everything you need.

It won't let me change it. Oh, there it is. I already had a plus one. Should I make it plus three? Well, let's see here.

So that modifier is just gonna add a circumstance bonus. What's let me see here. Follow the expert is Plus 20. Well, actually, you know what? Don't, get out of that stealth rule.

I'm just gonna drop a, follow the experts effect on you, and I'll do the same for Delmar, and then you don't have to worry about updating it yourself. Okay, you guys should both have have that now. Roll stealth. I'm getting Just roll stealth for Jason. Why is it not You should be able to do it from your from your HUD as well.

So where the little hand is for skills, you can just open that and roll stealth. Okay. Oh, that's amazing. What'd you roll? Party roll.

Two. Two. Do you want to maybe, use arrow point? Mhmm. Yeah.

I think that's pretty pathetic. I'm probably ass nine. So Mhmm. Roll it again. Yep.

To your hero point. Right click. Okay. I guess, I'm I'm a roll that. I'm struggling to get my character sheet to come oh, wow.

Okay. Here we go. Alright. So all of you. Hero points.

Okay. Yeah. So in so in this game, since you guys aren't playing demigods, you own you're you're you're not all getting hero points every hour. But I will be I will be randomly assigning one hero point to one person every hour, and you do start with one. If somebody does something especially cool over that hour time period, then I may elect to give the hero point to that person.

But otherwise, I'm just gonna, you know, it'll just be randomly assigned. I'm not even gonna choose them. There's a random button here, and that's the way I'm gonna do it. So Sounds good. You rewrote with the hero point.

So I thought you used to right click with it. Yeah. I thought that as well. I'm not sure what's going on here. But this is a new version of Foundry as well, so it might not do all the things.

Okay. But okay. So you guys start approaching you guys approach the you guys approach the, the mine. And the first thing that you notice as you're approaching it and you are coming in very quietly, is that the gates to the mind are, like, there is basically golden gate or not golden gates, wooden gates that open up to a larger quarry area that actually then goes down into a mine. And those gates are completely are completely burned, like they're burned down.

There are, and there are a few, there there are some rock ledges. And on top of those ledges, there are buildings that through that the dwarves build is kind of like a watchtower sort of things. Those things are completely intact, but the gates themselves are just completely decimated, and burned by fire. You don't really notice a whole lot as you're approaching, but as you get closer, you do you do actually pick up what's causing those monstrous skittering sounds. And you see that there is at least one creature that is scurrying around the inside of this mine, or the inside of this quarry, which is the entrance to the mines, and it's looks like a giant rat that is either on fire or made of fire or something's going on.

It looks like it's kinda like its skin is almost like cooled molten cooled lava and underneath it is like molten lava. This is the creature that you see. Excellent. And it's giant. By giant, you mean like dog sized, like horse sized, like elephant sized?

It is dwarf sized. Okay. Okay. And we're so it's it's still pretty big for a rat. So it's a big rat.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It is an r o u s Uh-huh.

Excellent. Excellent. Sweet. We got a greyhound sized fire rat. Right.

At least one. You you see you only see one at a time, but you suspect that there that there's a there that there's more than one. Excellent. I don't have any water to put that puppy out. Mhmm.

Alright. So what do you guys do? That's the only thing we can see in there? So far, you haven't you haven't done too much investigation because you were kinda creeping and sneaking in, and then you see this giant rat run by. So it kinda stops you dead in your tracks, and you're like, wait.

What? So What the heck is that? Exactly. So what is your immediate reaction to this? It does look like it's probably pretty dangerous.

It also is kind of, like, encircled by like a, I like it it like it's billowing smoke off of its, off of its skin, which makes it hard to be able to kind of see the actual form. Mhmm. But this isn't what's been making the tracks. So Definitely not. Is there I am not the person So basically But does does anybody have, like, a knowledge arcana or religion or oldism or anything that would give them some insight into what this might be or where it might come from?

Knowledge nature or If anybody would have any kind of skill like that, it would be the elementalist. Oh, well, we're screwed. Never mind. What's this? We got a gun slam now.

We're good. Yeah. I mean, just just as a basic as as a basic thing, this thing is not of the natural world. You 100% know that. Yeah.

As a kinetics, you would probably be able to discern that this is probably some sort of elemental creature from the elemental plane of fire is what you would guess. Mhmm. Right. You would just be able to infer that being a kineticist. Mhmm.

Mhmm. Okay. Okay. No rule necessary. Perfect.

But based on the size, that does seem to really corroborate with our concept that this is this was perpetrated by Giants. So And? All the more convinced that we're dealing with giants. Yeah. Okay.

So are your rats from hell? That's that's really not cool. Right? Yeah. How Okay.

So is this thing to us? At the moment, it's not terribly close. You like, with as well as you guys rolled, you can get as close to it as you need, up to getting up to walking through the gate itself. So you can get right up to that wooden gate with without without being noticed. Because you roll really, really good.

Okay. But they are but you you like I said, you see one at a time, but you you suspect there are more than one, and you basically just see them kinda scurrying across the gate. Like, they're not, like, right up in the gate. They're running around inside the Yeah. Inside the the quarry.

But you see them just kind of flash by the gate every now and then. You know? Okay. And if you do want to get up to the gate and that kind of stuff, then, then you can probably get a better look in that kind of stuff if that's what you're what you're looking for. I was just curious so I could shoot it.

Oh. Well, you can. How far away can you shoot? 50. 50.

Alright. So I won't unilaterally do that, but I definitely, like I take out my gun, and you see, Rurick. So, again, because of the ring, like, it kind of looks like he, like, reaches behind him and pulls out of nothing like this the shotgun. And I take and I load, load it with a, a really odd looking shell. It it looks like it's, like, inside of the, like, what's a normal looking shell.

It looks like there's some kind of it's translucent, and there's some kind of, like, bluish liquid in there. When I put it in and cock it to ready it, look at the look at my other two guys like we do with this. I would begin to channel elements, maybe. Is this a good time to do that? Is that the right am I doing the right thing?

That is the right thing to do. If you're planning on pausing if you're planning on doing anything that you can do, you need to channel elements. Right. I just wanna make sure I'm talking the right particular Right. Thing that I do.

Absolutely. Okay. And and just kind of looking at the looking at the overall looking at the overall map here, and I'll I I will go ahead and move you over to the map. So I it's saying I have to do the Connecticut first. Oh, because should open your Connecticut gate.

And you, you you have your kinetic aura up, so you you've got your gate open. I do. Yeah. If you look at your character, there's this connect there's this, aura that says kinetic aura or this little status that says connect aura. Okay.

Yeah. That tells you that you are good to go. Okay. So Okay. Just to give you a just to give you this is kind of in order, Ramsey, in order for you to be able to hit at 50, that's that's about where you can be.

Okay. Scott and Clark our son, Clark. Scott Scott and Jason, you guys can move yourselves to anywhere up to this gate, but you won't be able to you won't be able to go through the gate without being noticed. So if you go through the gate, we start combat at that very moment. So you can reposition yourself anywhere that you want to at this point.

If you're waiting for, you're waiting for, for Rurik to, take his shot to start the combat, then, that is where the that is where the rat will be when you can when you start your start your combat. So, yeah, so feel free to reposition yourself any way that you want to before we before we actually do the before we actually roll for combat. But, I'm assuming we're hitting things. So That's my plan. Mhmm.

Big scary rat in there burning this place down. Okay. Is it still where we get three actions return and all that stuff? Yeah. Yep.

Everything yeah. The the only differences are the hero points, and, you guys don't have a bunch of extra things that you have to make decisions on for your characters. So, let's go ahead and get get combat going here. Let's do it. So everybody roll your initiative.

Yeah. And also yeah. I should actually you know what? You guys don't have to roll initiative. Yeah.

Because you rolled your stealth. Yeah. Your stealth roll gets to be your initiative if you want. Yeah. Yeah.

Sure. Absolutely. Okay. So I'm just gonna I'm gonna update that. So I like that it says our hit points on the screen.

Okay. There we go. That's how you do that. Underneath our picture. Mhmm.

So Yeah. I would probably arm myself. I forget how you do that. If you draw both your weapons. Dundee.

Okay. And Rick. K. Alright. So we so what we're gonna do here is we are going to start, as you guys as you guys get closer in, you do notice that there is definitely a second rat in there.

So, we'll go ahead and start off. We'll Ramsey, I'll I'll let you take one shot, and then we'll start the then we'll start the combat from there. Yep. Sick. Sounds good to me.

How do I do this? Yes. That is an action that I would like to take. Well oh oh, wait. Wait.

Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

Wait. Wait. That's right. There was a where where did it go? Where'd it go?

There it is. Bam. It's a toggle. It is toggled. Alright.

Yes. We are going to shoot him. So I for my hiding position behind this, I'm going to snipe at the cinder rat with my dwarven shotgun. My dwarven scatter gun. We're gonna go.

We are we loaded a a elemental ammunition of lesser cold, and we're gonna go for it. Yeah. Yeah. I am a elemental, craftsman. Okay.

Make sure all this is right. Yep. Yep. It all looks right to me. I assume that it's going to be flat.

Well, not flat. Whatever it's called, off guard since I am hidden from it. And here we go. Oh, why did I oh, okay. Oh, a flat check?

Okay. It's concealed. Yeah. It is concealed. Oh.

Okay. Okay. So Yeah. So Yep. Yep.

So these Cinder Rats are, like, they're like I said, they're surrounded by a by wisps of smoke, which just makes it hard for you to be able to Mhmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. See where they are.

Sometimes you miss your DC five lap check. So I should end up miss it. Oh. But that does initiate everything here. So, let us begin.

Demlour, you are up. I would probably, you know, go in with, I don't know what all of these Yeah. The basic analysis doesn't do me anything at the moment. We did the channels. We're good there.

Yep. I mean, typically, you you could always open with an elemental blast. That is that is one of your blood bread and butter moves. Mhmm. You you could you could try and do one of your other special moves, but either way.

Is there I'm not sure what the range on the elemental blast is. It is I'm pretty sure it's 30. It's 30 feet for each one. I am gonna have to get a bit closer to a rat before that will be an effective effect. There is you have one rat that is 15 feet away from you.

Oh, there's one that's 15. Oh. You would need to peek around the corner because you're there's currently a wall in between you, but there is one that is pretty close. Okay. Yeah.

Well done. So you're probably gonna have to move regardless. But Yeah. I gotta get out of the is the bill. It's not letting me adjust the screen.

I can't see. Alright. So, am I allowed to move this guy or no? You are, or you should be. Okay.

There. That gets us. Okay. I did it. I moved.

So you can either go for the one that the one that Ramsey's dwarf shot, because apparently I don't have Which is? The right name, which is the one that's out in the center, or you could go for the one that's a little bit closer to you. I think I'm, you know, proximity is kind of a deal. So I'll go with this guy. I think I've targeted him.

Yep. Looks like. Can I do more than one attack, or is it just the first one on the same group? Well, it do. Change targets?

It it depends. So you've got a two action elemental blast or a one action elemental blast that you can do. If you do a one action elemental blast, it just does the damage die of the elemental blast. If you do two action elemental blast, it'll do your damage die plus your constitution. Yeah.

I was okay. So I was planning to do the, like, the two. Okay. But I don't I guess I don't see okay. Okay.

Sorry. Learning. Okay. Two Yep. No problem.

There's a button up there I can change to make it two actions or one actions. Okay. So I've got it into two actions. Oh, and just looking at your thing, and this is a side note, you are an investigator, which means you have the option you you can pursue a lead, which gives you bonuses to anything that's related to that lead. So, keep that in mind when, you know, you could say, my lead is finding out what happened to the Giants, or my lead is finding out what happened to this this thing and that kind of thing.

But that's neither here nor there at the moment. I don't think it affects your to hit. But Okay. So then I am like, so I got it adjusted for two actions, then I will click on the blue blast plus 10. Mhmm.

And then I will roll a dice that has my trained proficiency, my constitution, my gait attenuator, and we roll. That was a little vocal. What's the Oh, stupid flat checks, man. Oh my gosh. What the is that what the one was?

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You guys are doing terrible on your flat checks.

Yeah. And so then I would take another shot with, plus five. Right? Blue button? Well, if you did the two action one, you moved, which was an action, and then you used the two action one, which it which is your third act is your second and third action.

So So the one rule counted as the two. Right. It wasn't two attacks. Correct. No.

Yeah. So you do more damage when you hit the damage. Action one. Yeah. Apparently, no.

I don't do any damage. Well When you hit. One one slash if. Yeah. Okay.

So if I had chosen the one action, then I could attack two times. Right. But every hit deals less damage. Absolutely no sense, but perfect. Okay.

Alright. Well, Hurgen, you're up. How would you like to miss this one, Hurgen? Hopefully, one of you will hit something. Oh.

So if I go all the way up to this guy, that's two actions because he's 30 feet away. Right. I cannot and I don't know how to play this guy yet. When I go to hit, I can only use one of my weapons. Right?

Correct. Unless you use your special ability called twin takedown. Twin takedown, will let you attack with both of your weapons for one action. So why wouldn't I do that? I have no idea why you wouldn't do that.

When when you're when you're swinging with twin takedown, you your second attack with your second weapon, is that is that your negative penalty. But it's a one but it's a one action to to attack. So, I mean, super solid. Yeah. So if I go to my actions it doesn't matter which one's one, but you do one at the first strike and then one at the second strike scenario?

Right. Right. Is there a way to do those simultaneously? No. You just do one and then do the do the other.

And, and something that you will want to do in this specific instance is probably best to just use twin takedown regardless, but, hunt prey is kind of your like your bread and butter thing that you wanna use to target creatures and that you do slightly more damage that are easier to track and that kind of stuff when you've got hunt prey active. But regardless, like, given where you're at, I've twin twin takedown is the correct move for sure. So just roll your to hit with your first weapon and then roll your second, one with your second weapon. So did I accidentally put hunt prey on there? It wasn't supposed to.

Oh. I took it off. Okay. I forgot that I had to probably. Right double right click something.

Strike. So you're saying do this one at a time. Roll this. Yes. Nice.

You hit. You actually But you missed. Hit it. Almost. You passed the flat check, but you missed the hit.

So roll your second roll your second with your war hammer. And that one is the m a p minus three. Right? Yep. Is it possible to hit these things?

It is possible to hit these things, and you just did it. You did it. So you swing with your fur you swing with your your axe and it just goes through the mist. You thought the creature was there and it's not. And then you come back around with your, with your hammer and you hit something solid.

Go ahead and roll damage. Oh, nice. Alright. Uh-oh. Barely hurt, guys.

That's fine. The first of all is fine, Scott. You're you're used to swinging and hitting once and then doing 50 damage. This is No. I'm just doing a little damage with It's a little bit different.

Alright. So it's the cinder rat's turn now. It's going to go oh, there's a tasty little morsel ring from me. I'm a bite it. I it's gonna miss.

It's going to choose to move away. Well actually it's not gonna move away just yet. It's gonna try and bite you a second time. Uh-oh. This time it's gonna hit and it's gonna crit.

Oh, live snaps are good. And we'll hold a one. Oof. So it it takes a bite out of you, and your wound just starts to emulate and you're and you're and you become on fire. And then it's gone wrong.

Watch out for their bite. Alright. Rurik, you're up. You do not currently have a clear land site. I surely do not.

Alright. Well, we are gonna waddle ourselves till we have a clear line of sight. We're gonna move up here behind Demalore. Actually, are we? Hang on.

Let me rethink that. Wait. Dang it. Can I just cancel? Go back somehow because it's calculating all my movement I've made so far.

Yeah. I think you can hit escape. Maybe? That didn't work. That's fine.

We'll just we'll just measure. 22 and a half. Thanks. That's not that's not helpful, game. Alright.

So it would be, so 05:10, twenty, twenty five to get here, which is my movement. So, yeah, that'll work. I move up here. Final answer. And then I am going take the hide action behind this little thing here, and I'm going to use my class feature, which is, my way of the sniper feature, which is covered reload.

So I can hide and reload in the same action. So I will do that. So as I like duck behind there and reload another shell of my shotgun and cock it, I'm gonna say, you know, alright. Stay away from him, you bastard. And we will, try to Damn.

I I tried to hide, and now I'm gonna try to shoot this thing and hopefully, not screw it up. Alright. Using that ammunition still. Yep. Cool.

Cool. Cool. Wow. Well, I passed my concealed check, but I missed. Alright.

Nah. Nah. Nah. Nah. Nah.

Nah. Nah. Hello? Sorry. How do I hero point again?

I I missed it. I don't because the right clicking wasn't working. Yeah. Okay. I think you're just gonna have to reroll it.

Just reroll it. And then yeah. Reroll it. And if you roll under a 10, we'll add the add the 10 like we Okay. That still applies.

Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.

Cool. I'll start a little flat check again, but that's alright. Well, okay. But Technically pass the flat check. Right?

Yeah. Yeah. You pass the flat check. Yeah. Alright.

Cool. Hit, not crit, but that is alright. We take those. Alright. So it should have, yeah, that seems like all the things.

Seems good. Bam. Okay. What do we got going on here? We got damage, we got splash damage, we got other splash damage.

Yep. Persistent cold damage. Yep. Yep. Okay.

Cool. It just applies it all. Sick. K. Wow.

Excellent. That's me. That was that was a good that was a good hit. Alright. And I will make sure it took off my one shot, one kill because that's just for my first attack, my first successful hit.

Not to that. Alright. I gotta tackle it off. That's fine. So it took, like, six points of damage there.

Is that what I'm seeing? 17. No. It took it took 20 damage, plus there was one damage from splash damage, plus there was another six damage from other splash damage. Oh, there's 20.

Okay. Because no. Because there was, yeah, because it it was weak to cold. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Which caused this additional damage. So, I mean, it's like Yeah. There's there's lots going on here. Yeah.

Right. It's almost like he had the perfect ammunition to fight an element. Right. The element. The hell?

Something. It worked out. Alright. So this one is running up to you, and he is going to try and munch and crunch. Oh, no.

Blah blah blah blah blah. He will. Yep. He will. Feeling seven points of damage to you, and he's going to try a second bite.

Oh, one bite. Yes. He's going to deal five more points of damage. Look at you. Yeah.

Move on. Top of the round, Demlar, you're up. Now something that I don't know if you remember, but you are an elemental dwarf yourself. Mhmm. Mhmm.

And you do have a energy emanation that you can do once a day. Mhmm. That energy emanation Mhmm. Is cold. Mhmm.

It only works with adjacent creatures, but it does two d six cold damage for a basic reflex save. I was kind of hoping I'd be able to sneak in between these two guys and set that off real quick. They are not in a position where I can quack a lack to I know. We're not quaffling there. For one.

Yep. So you can only get one at the moment. So maybe you can do an elemental blast or do one of your other abilities. If you're doing a melee elemental blast, you also add your strength on top of your constitution if you do a two action one. So Well, I I don't see how I have, oh, that's interesting.

So okay. I think I have it slashing at the moment then. I think I've selected slashing for the melee. Yes. Certainly looks that way.

Yes. I think I've got him targeted correctly. So it's two actions, so I get one quack. Yep. Yes.

Yep. Okay. Stop sucking it up. So in here, it's it's adding my constitution. Yeah.

But is it the on the damage it adds? It's on damage. It's it's on damage. Yeah. You never you never actually use strength to hit.

Oh, I think I should do something. Looks good. Pretty good. Looks like a crit. That looks pretty good.

Yeah. Look at that. So now over here in this thing, I click on damage or critical? Click on critical. Click on critical.

It's gonna bring up my damage role. And when d four is is it supposed it's not supposed to be acid. That's that is not added to the thing. That's that's additional things you have to click add on it. So So we're not doing that good.

Two action Yep. Plus four strength plus one. So we're all set then. Yes? Yep.

Think so. Alright. You so how so what's your elemental blast looking like right now? Like, is it are you forming metal weapons that you're attacking with, or are you just blasting it with, with pieces of metal, or, like, what's that? So this one was up close.

So Yeah. Yeah. It would've I I would've done something much more like a, a substantially oversized, hammer, perhaps. So just I don't know. Do you see him kinda, like, lean back a little bit?

And then as he's, like it looks like he's swinging a a maul, but there's nothing in his hand for half a second. And as he's bringing it forward, you start to see the the form of a a giant, you know, like, as big as his chest, hammer start to develop in the air and and become solid on impact. That's awesome. That's awesome. Also, I would like to point out that you have another action that you can spend.

You can either use that to move away from the creature or you could do a second elemental blast at AU as a level one elemental blast. So b five attack number. One action. Mhmm. This guy.

Yeah. It can be either ranged or melee. Like, you can do either. So I think that one would have to be range because I don't have a move and an attack. Right?

Because I use two actions on the first one. Correct? Right. So you've well, yeah. But you you if you attack the same rat, the second time, you can do melee.

Okay. Okay. Or you can attack or you can attack the one that's at death's door and send a ranged attack towards it. Either one is a good option. So you see what you want.

One seen better. I don't see either of those being bad. Yeah. I think I'll continue the attack with the one that I've got. Okay.

Yeah. So we'll do that. It's still the yeah. Plus five. K.

That's a hit. Good. Good. This is just regular damage. Yep.

So we'll go ahead and do regular damage. Ouch. For me. That didn't add strength to it, though. It it did.

You just rolled a one. So it was a one plus with one strength. Oh, okay. Yeah. Okay.

Okay. Sounds good. No. It's nothing compared to your 20 damage. Oh, my gosh.

20 is crazy. Yeah. That's crazy. Yeah. Alright.

Cool. Cool. Damage. Yeah. Alright.

So good for that. And, Demlaur, you did take one point of damage from the persistent fire damage at the end of your turn. So That's cool. It does all that automatically. Yeah.

And, yeah, and you tried to recover, but were unable to do that. So alright. Hergen, you are up. Move up. Are you going to, hunters mark this guy, or or was it favorite foe?

No. That those are different. Prey. Hunters prey. Or you're just gonna whack it because, I mean, it's Yeah.

It's at desk door, so maybe just use one action here. Try to hit it Okay. With the double thing again. That's right. Okay.

It up. Switch it up and do this one first. So Warhammer first. Oh. Oh, you're bugger.

Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. They stole that critical from you. It's okay. Yeah.

All you need to do is hit it. Alright. Oh my gosh. Oh, no. I wish that you're rolling like I roll.

Yeah. For for a third action, how do I roll my two things again? Does one of them become the middle one and then the other one bottom one? No. One of them becomes the bottom one, and the other one you have to just do another do another neg three on it.

Or wait. Would be The ones. What does that mean? Your target isn't your yeah. So I un I unchecked your target is hunted prey because it's not hunted prey.

You get the you get the really good, like, multiple attack penalty. Like, it's neg it's a three. It's a neg three instead of an neg five when you're attacking your hunted prey. But because this because you're not he's not hunted, you know. So, yeah, you but you'd be doing the negative the negative ten one, and then you need to do a negative then you need to add a negative five to the next one.

Yeah. That first one missed. Negative ten one also missed. But you succeeded your flat check. It's terrible.

So you swing in and you like, this thing, it just keeps on not being where you expect it to be. This crazy. On the bright side, you are no longer on fire. Nice. But I took a lot of damage.

You did take eight damage, which is significant. I'm about to get bitten. It is gonna bite you. Like, you're done. Attempt to bite you.

Doing so well. And this one is going to okay. Something's wonky. That's alright. He's gonna run up to this.

He's gonna run up to you. Well, I don't like that. You are currently you're not hidden. You aren't behind any cover. Mhmm.

So he's just gonna he's just gonna attack you. I would rather he didn't. Mhmm. We would all rather things we would all rather things be different sometimes. Mhmm.

You heard He's He's trying. Oh. And he misses. He critically misses. Uh-huh.

I don't think that really counts for much of anything with a bite attack, but, he definitely is not hit. He he chipped a tooth on that bite. Okay. The cinder rat does take its cold damage. K.

So it takes six cold damage. It does not recover. And it fails to recover. So Alright. Really, I mean, you could probably.

Hey, I'm not super worried about that one next to me, to be honest. I think what I'm a do is I am going to hide from the one down here, and reload at the same time because we like to do that. Actions hide. And then I'm gonna shoot him. Yeah, I mean, we crafted these things.

We're gonna use them. Right? Strike. And I am going to, I noticed that something is off with my math so I am going to change it in post. And bam.

Double twelves. Set looking good. Got them. And we're gonna roll the damage. Why is the damage calico is so weird, but that's okay.

Okay, kickback, yep, scatter, yep, yep. Okay, alright. Where's that d4 coming from? Slingers precision? Hold on.

That's not right. That's not right. One second. I don't think I should have that. New character who this.

Slingers precision. Plus two precision with strikes made using non repeating crossbows. Yeah. No. Oh, and you yield an extra d four precision on strikes using non repeating firearms.

Oh, which this is. So, yeah, no. That is correct. Alright. Thing knows what it's talking about.

Sick. Oh my gosh. Not good. Not good damage, but it is weak to the cold. Bam.

Alright. Cool. So that was two actions. And then for three, I'm just gonna reload it. What took that is 17 points of damage?

Yeah. Yeah. They're both not doing great. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

That's splendid. Alright. That's, that's me. Alright. Okay.

So we've got this guy, he's going to get him. He's going to continue to try and munch and crunch on the current, on Person. Similar dealing six points of damage and Demlar is back on being on fire again. He's going to move over to are not on fire. Think I stopped being on fire.

You did. No. Maybe you didn't. I don't know. I think it was Horgan.

You're just more on fire. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just firing some more. This guy scurries over to Hurgen and misses him.

Yeah. And then freezes to death. That succumbs to his cold. Excellent. His his care his, his cooling lava skin just starts just becomes extremely crusty and it turns into a statue of, a statue of of obsidian.

Excellent. Or whatever lava stone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Right. Emblor, you're up. With that magnetic pinions, it says that I would roll attacks against up to three creatures. I do not have to. Right.

So I okay. I just want to make sure that it's not like some just I throw things everywhere and it hits the three closest things, and it happens to hit all of my allies as well. No. No. No.

You you you just can't use the magnetic pinions on more than once on any one creature. Okay. Gotcha. So you have to attack multiple creatures in order to be able to up to three creatures, but you can't just, like, hit the same creature three times. Right.

So I'm gonna do that one anyway. Yeah. I think, question becomes, how? Okay. So looks like you need to roll an impulse attack.

So if you look at the That's a button there to push. Yeah. Okay. Good. If you click on that, Clicking on that.

I'm rolling that. All of the math is fantastic. Oh, my gosh. Okay. Nothing.

I don't do it. Let's see. Roll against three creatures, 60 feet you gain plus one circumstance bonus on your attack roll against any target creature wearing metal armor. Three tax count towards your multiple attack penalty, but it doesn't increase until okay. So yeah.

Yeah. Suck. Who would have thought that concealment would be such a that one wasn't the concealment. The would be really Well, yeah. But your your concealment check was really, really good.

So you basically good. Yeah. Yeah. You shoot a a start of metal at it, and it's, it the metal basically just ricochets off of its off of its molten skin. Yay.

Very good. Yeah. Good card. 30 feet. Can't even get to them without really wanted to do the hunt and pray thing.

Yeah. That's only 20. Oh, that's only 20. Okay. Yeah.

Get them. Just wanna try the hunt prey thing one time. Yep. Use it. Can I use it?

Right. Yep. Looks like yeah. Now do your twin takedowns. So why did, just trying to figure out the negative scores here on the second one.

It used to say negative three and then negative something else, seven maybe. Right. It's a negative three per 10. Okay. So if you are you looking at your character sheet or are you looking at the the, HUD?

The HUD Is that the top of your action? Okay. At the top there, there's a checkbox that says target your hunted prey. Yeah. Just mark that.

Do that. Yep. So I could still swing twice. Yep. Hit.

The hit. Roll damage. I think you're only gonna need the hit once. Hoping. Hoping.

So weak. Get out of here. It's enough. It's enough. Alright.

So you run up to the rat, and you hit it with your war axe. You're coming around with your war hammer, but it falls to the ground and crumbles into chunks of lava rock. Real quick, Chris. If I do two handed, what does that do instead of trying to do white? Basically yeah.

Two handed means you're holding it with both hands. You won't be able to do the twin takedown, but, you know Right. You'll but you do I'll do more damage. Use a yeah. You've got a bigger damage die.

So you don't actually do more damage. You have the potential to do more damage. What's the difference? You'll be doing more. Is it like a d a versus a d four or some?

Yeah. It depends on the weapon. I can look at it next time because I know it's late. Your dwarven war axe, well, this is easy enough for me to just do right now. Damage with your dwarven war axe with one hand is a d eight plus four.

If you change your grip to plus is a d12 plus four. So not too shabby but you but you don't get the whirlwind thing, so you don't get like all of the all of the extra attacks and that kind of stuff. So, in general Flurry Ranger is better dual wielding, but you but there are definitely times where maybe it might make sense to do two handed but, okay, so we are going to also in this game, I'm not going to be assigning XP per fight, I'm just gonna be giving XP at the end of the session. So for all that you guys were able to accomplish this, tonight, you all gain, for going in, taking care taking care accepting the accepting the offer, going through and investigating and finding and and discovering the presence of giant footprints and that kind of stuff, you all receive 500 XP for the session tonight. Yes.

So before, before I let you guys go, I do want to give you a little follow-up. As you guys as you're finishing up tonight or you're finishing up the the rats, you're pulling your weapons out of the out of the crumbles, and your adrenaline begins to lower, you start to and you start to take the you start to try to recover from the combat, you hear something coming from the mines, voices guttural and harsh, not dwarven suddenly the ground trembles and they're getting closer You hear, I not know where it go, this cave too small. Yeah, why stumpy's make things so small? Quiet fools, your masters and mine will not be pleased unless we find the creature. We need to find a different exit.

You see two hulking ogres emerge, their skin marked with crude runes, between them an odd orange glowing dwarf like creature, its eyes burning with elemental fire. They appear to be having a heated debate. And that is where we will end it tonight. Alright. Change.

Looks like you could get pretty safe. Fires still. Yeah. There's there's something that looks like it might be fire related still that you can freeze. Excellent.

Well, on the other hand, the, second type of alchemical ammunition that I craft is not gonna do me very much good because it is fire. But Yes. You know, I was like, we'll take cold and we'll take fire Yep. Between the two. We'll probably hit something.

So I think those are happening. Those are big. Yeah. And that those are the ogres. Right there.

Yeah. Yeah. Oh. And this is the dwarf like creature. The fire dwarf.

Yep. Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool.

Cool. They have yet to have noticed you. However, it is only a matter of moments. And that is where we will leave it for tonight. Thank you, everybody.

I appreciate you staying on a little bit extra. I know that we try and get it close to ten, and we're beyond that. But, two weeks good? I So have no reason to believe otherwise. I think that's good for me.

Alright. Same. That would be day after Labor Day? I think so. Yes.

Correct. You okay as far as I know? Okay. Excellent. Alright.

I'm jumping off plan on guys. Yep. See you, Scott. See you. We'll plan on picking up there.

Alright. Sounds good. I'm awful off. Thanks, Chris. Yeah.

Good to see you guys. See you next time. See you later. Yeah. Chris, can can I get myself off fire?

Oh, yeah. I can do that for you. I don't know what I have to do. Second.
