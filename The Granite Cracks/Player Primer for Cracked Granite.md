## 🛡️ **The Dwarves of Aetheria: A Primer for Players**

### 🏔️ **Who Are the Dwarves of Ironhold?**

The dwarves of Ironhold are a proud, resilient people who survived the cataclysmic **Flaming Retribution** by sealing themselves deep within their mountain strongholds. While the surface world burned, they endured—by stone, steel, and stubborn will.

Now, one year later, the gates have opened.

Ironhold is a kingdom of clans. Each clan has its own traditions, strengths, and responsibilities—miners, warriors, scholars, traders, mystics, scouts. Some dwarves are born into these clans. Others walk alone, clanless but not without purpose.

### ⚔️ **The Giant Wars**

Centuries ago, the dwarves of Ironhold fought a brutal war against the giant tribes of the north. These towering enemies were powerful, cruel, and aligned with dark gods. The war was long and devastating, but the dwarves prevailed—driving the giants to the brink of extinction.

Today, the giants are remembered as a threat that was **wiped from the face of Aetheria**, never to rise again. Their ruins remain, but their power is believed to be broken.

### 🏛️ **Politics of Ironhold**

Ironhold is ruled by **King Hargrin Deepmantle**, a monarch who survived the Flaming Retribution and now seeks to rebuild the dwarven legacy. His vision is bold: to reclaim the surface and reestablish dwarven colonies across the land.

Not all dwarves agree.

Two major factions shape Ironhold’s future:

- **Isolationists** believe Ironhold should remain sealed and self-sufficient. They fear the surface is still cursed and that expansion invites ruin.
- **Expansionists** support the king’s efforts to reclaim lost lands and restore dwarven influence. They see opportunity in rebuilding and reconnecting with the world.

These factions exist across clans, families, and guilds. Some clans lean heavily toward one side, while others are divided within.
