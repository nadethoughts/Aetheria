### 🪓 **Introduction – The Cracked Granite**

> _The Fourth Age is young, but already scarred._
> 
> A year has passed since the skies burned and the world changed. While kingdoms fell and empires fractured, the dwarves of Ironhold endured—sealed within their mountain halls, shielded by stone and tradition.
> 
> Now, the gates have opened.
> 
> Ironhold looks outward once more, seeking to reclaim its place in the world. The halls echo with the sounds of rebuilding, of reforging old alliances, and of preparing for what lies beyond the granite walls.
> 
> You are dwarves of renown—adventurers, soldiers, champions. Whether born of noble blood or hardened in the mines, your deeds have earned you respect. You are not bound by politics or clan feuds. You are trusted to act with strength, wisdom, and honor.
> 
> The world beyond the stone is uncertain. The future of Ironhold may rest in your hands.
> 
> Choose your path. Forge your legacy. And remember:
> 
> Stone may crack.
> 
> But it does not break easily.
