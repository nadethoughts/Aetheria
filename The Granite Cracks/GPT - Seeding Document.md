Baelgrin Deepdelve has served the royal court of Ironhold for over a century, having earned his title through decades of study, excavation, and translation of ancient dwarven texts. He is one of the few remaining scholars who remembers the world before the Flaming Retribution and has firsthand knowledge of the kingdom’s lost outer holdings.

As a young ogre, Gorvok was used as a pit fighter and shock trooper, surviving by sheer brutality and cunning. His rise through the ranks was marked by bloodshed, betrayal, and the ritual slaying of his own war-chief.

When Grondar Earthcaller began assembling his warbands in the wake of the Flaming Retribution, Gorvok was among the first to answer the call. He saw in Grondar not just a leader, but a godlike figure who promised him endless war and the chance to carve his name into the bones of the world.

## 🪨 Grondar Earthcaller – High Voice of the Stone

- **Race**: Stone Giant
- **Gender**: Male
- **Alignment**: Neutral Evil
- **Role**: Commander of the Giant Warbands, Elemental Seer
- **Faction**: Leader of the resurgent giants, allied with Varric Silvervein

### 🧱 Background

Grondar Earthcaller is one of the oldest living stone giants, a relic of the Second Age who witnessed the rise and fall of empires from the shadows of the mountains. He was once a spiritual leader among his kind, interpreting the tremors of the earth and the flow of leyline energy. When the dwarves drove the giants into hiding centuries ago, Grondar retreated into the deep caverns, preserving ancient knowledge and waiting for a sign.

That sign came with the **Flaming Retribution**. As meteors fell and the land cracked, Grondar felt the leyline network pulse with renewed energy. He interpreted this as a divine signal: the surface world was weakened, and the giants could rise again. Through ancient rituals, he reactivated dormant leyline chambers and reached out to those who would aid his cause—including **Varric Silvervein**, whose ambition aligned with Grondar’s vision of a reshaped world.

### 🎯 Ambition

To restore the giants’ dominion over the mountains and reclaim the elemental balance disrupted by dwarven expansion.

### 🔥 Motivation

Grondar believes the dwarves have corrupted the natural order with their forges, mines, and magic. He sees himself not as a conqueror, but as a purifier—returning the world to its primal state. His alliance with Varric is strategic; he intends to use the dwarf’s influence to fracture Ironhold from within, then crush the remnants under stone and flame.

### 🧩 Adventure Hooks

- His warbands bear runes that blend giant and dwarven styles—evidence of Varric’s influence.
- He may attempt to awaken a dormant elemental guardian beneath Ironhold.
- The party could uncover his leyline sanctum and disrupt his rituals, weakening the warbands.

- **Faction**: Giant Warband

### 🧱 Background

Korrak Flintshard was born in the deep caverns beneath the Shattered Peaks, raised among the remnants of a once-proud stone giant clan. As a youth, he was marked by a prophecy carved into the cavern walls: “The hammer shall rise when the mountain breaks.” When the Flaming Retribution shattered the surface and awakened the leyline beneath his ancestral home, Korrak took it as a sign.

He was among the first to answer Grondar Earthcaller’s call, pledging his strength and loyalty to the High Voice of the Stone.

### 🎯 Ambition

To become the warlord of the surface once the dwarves are defeated and to restore the ancient dominion of the stone giants.

![[Marnak Deepforge.webp]]

## ⛏️ Marnak Deepforge – Guildmaster of the Ironhold Miners’ Consortium

- **Race**: Dwarf
- **Gender**: Male
- **Alignment**: Lawful Neutral (with shades of ambition)
- **Role**: Master of Mining Operations, Economic Powerbroker
- **Faction**: Secretly aligned with Varric Silvervein

### 🧱 Background

Marnak Deepforge rose from humble beginnings in the lower tunnels of Ironhold. A brilliant surveyor and shrewd negotiator, he unified several competing mining clans under the Ironhold Miners’ Consortium, becoming one of the most influential non-noble dwarves in the kingdom. His success earned him a seat at the king’s economic council, though he has always resented the nobles who look down on his “dirty hands.”

After the Flaming Retribution, Marnak was instrumental in reopening collapsed tunnels and restoring ore flow to the forges. But he also discovered something else—**a hidden vein of crystal-laced stone etched with ancient runes**, deep beneath the mountains. He brought this secret to Varric Silvervein, seeing in him a kindred spirit: a dwarf who would break the old order and reward those who built Ironhold from the ground up.

### 🎯 Ambition

To become the first common-born dwarf to sit on the royal council as a peer—and to control the kingdom’s most powerful resource veins.

### 🔥 Motivation

Marnak believes the nobility has failed Ironhold. He sees Varric’s rise as a chance to reshape the kingdom into a meritocracy—one where wealth and results matter more than bloodlines. His loyalty is not to Varric personally, but to the vision of a new Ironhold where dwarves like him are no longer second-class citizens.

### 🧩 Adventure Hooks

- May offer the party access to restricted tunnels or resources—at a price.
- Could be caught falsifying mining reports or diverting materials to Varric’s faction.
- If exposed, he may try to buy his way out or turn on Varric to save himself.

- **Alignment**: Neutral Evil
- **Role**: Elemental Servitor, Ritualist, Warband Support
- **Faction**: Serves Grondar Earthcaller and the elemental cause

### 🧱 Background

Skarn was not born—he was **forged**. During the early resurgence of the giants, Grondar Earthcaller performed a ritual deep within a leyline chamber corrupted by the Flaming Retribution. The ritual called upon the elemental forces of fire and stone to create a living weapon. From the molten core of the mountain, Skarn emerged—a being of flame and fury, bound by runes and purpose.

Though he speaks little, Skarn is known to chant in ancient tongues during battle, invoking forgotten elemental names and prophecies. He believes the world must be **cleansed**—burned down to its bones so that a new age may rise. He sees the giants as the rightful stewards of this rebirth and serves Grondar with unwavering devotion.

### 🎯 Ambition

To awaken the elemental heart of the mountains and bring about a new age of fire and stone.

### 🔥 Motivation

### 🧩 Adventure Hooks

- His runes may match those found in corrupted dwarven relics, hinting at Varric’s involvement.
- He could be encountered performing a ritual to awaken a dormant elemental guardian.
- If defeated, his essence may linger, corrupting the land or whispering through flame.

His father perished during the Flaming Retribution while sealing the gates of the Deepforge to protect the last of the dwarven relics. Thorek inherited not only his father’s hammer but also the burden of preserving the kingdom’s martial legacy.

He rose to prominence during the reconstruction of Ironhold’s inner defenses, forging weapons and armor for the king’s elite guard. His craftsmanship is unmatched, and his loyalty to King Hargrin is absolute. He views the forge as sacred—a place where dwarven strength is reborn with every strike of the hammer.

### 🎯 Ambition

To restore the Deepforge to its full glory and ensure that Ironhold is never again caught unprepared.

### 🔥 Motivation

Thorek is driven by duty, legacy, and a deep-seated belief that the strength of the dwarves lies in their steel. He distrusts politics and sees Varric’s rise as a threat to the unity and discipline of the kingdom. Though not a courtly man, he commands respect through action and integrity.

### 🧩 Adventure Hooks

- He may offer the party custom-forged weapons or armor if they prove themselves.
- He suspects sabotage in the forge’s supply lines—possibly linked to Varric’s faction.
- If assassinated or framed, his death would send shockwaves through the loyalist ranks.

- **Name**: Syrith
- **Title**: The Shadowed
- **Origin**: Born in the bustling city of [[Lumopolis]], the capital of [[The Blessed Realm]]
- **Background**: Syrith was known for her keen intellect and mysterious aura. Even as a child, she had an uncanny ability to sense hidden truths and navigate the complexities of human emotions.

- **Divine Selection**: Chosen by Raythelion for her perceptive nature and unerring sense of justice, Syrith was granted a divine spark, becoming a [[La Pelu]].
- **Role**: Syrith's role as a [[La Pelu]] involved uncovering hidden dangers, exposing corruption, and ensuring that justice was served in the shadows where light did not easily reach.

## The Path to Darkness

- **Isolation**: Syrith's duties often kept her isolated from her fellow [[La Pelu]] and the general populace. Her work required secrecy and discretion, which gradually distanced her from others.
- **Desperation**: In her solitude, Syrith grew desperate to connect with others and find understanding. She began to see shadows not only as her domain but as her only companions.

## Descent into Shadow

- **Temptation**: [[Erabose]], the dark god, saw an opportunity in Syrith's isolation. He whispered to her, offering her the companionship and understanding she craved.
- **Corruption**: Gradually, [[Erabose]]'s influence twisted Syrith's sense of justice. She began to believe that true justice could only be achieved through darker means, that the ends justified the means.

## Transformation and Fall

- **Betrayal of Light**: Syrith started using her powers to manipulate and control rather than protect and guide. She believed she was still serving justice, but her methods became increasingly ruthless.
- **Exposure**: Her actions were eventually discovered by her fellow [[La Pelu]]. In a desperate confrontation, Syrith refused to relinquish her belief in her corrupted form of justice.

- **Symbol of Corruption**: Syrith's name is synonymous with the corrupting influence of power and the dangers of isolation. Her story is told to warn against the perils of straying from the path of true justice.
- **Impact on [[La Pelu]]**: Her fall led to greater scrutiny and oversight of [[La Pelu]], with an emphasis on ensuring they remain connected to their communities and avoid the pitfalls of solitude and unchecked power.

## Final Notes

- **Myth and Reality**: Over time, Syrith's story has taken on a mythic quality. Some see her as a tragic figure who sought justice but lost her way, while others view her as a cautionary tale of the dangers of isolation and corruption.
- **Continued Influence**: Despite her downfall, Syrith's legacy continues to influence the world. Her story serves as a stark reminder of the importance of vigilance, community, and staying true to one's principles.
- **[[La Pelu]]'s Burden**: The tale of Syrith is a constant reminder to all [[La Pelu]] of the heavy burden they bear. They must guard against isolation and corruption, striving to remain connected to the light and their true purpose.

- **Date**: Approximately one year before the current timeline (End of the third age)
- **Location**: Continent of [[Solaris]], primarily affecting [[The Blessed Realm]]
- **Type**: Cataclysmic Event
- **Description**: The Flaming Retribution was a devastating event that brought meteors, flaming debris, and boiling geysers upon [[The Blessed Realm]] and other parts of [[Solaris]], leading to widespread destruction and the collapse of the once-great kingdom.

## **Cause**

### **Divine Prophecy**
- **Prophetic Warnings**: The prophets of [[Raythelion]], the god worshiped by the Blessed Realm, had foretold the impending doom. They warned the inhabitants of the Blessed Realm to repent and change their ways, but their warnings were largely ignored.
- **Divine Judgement**: The Flaming Retribution was believed to be a divine punishment from [[Raythelion]] for the hubris, corruption, and moral decline of [[The Blessed Realm]]. The kingdom had turned from their ways of enlightenment and guidance to oppression and conquest.

## **Events**

### **Meteor Shower**
- **Meteors and Debris**: The event began with a shower of meteors and flaming debris falling from the sky, causing massive fires and widespread destruction across the land.
- **Impact Sites**: Major cities, including [[Lumopolis]], were heavily impacted. Buildings were reduced to rubble, and entire regions were set ablaze.

### **Boiling Geysers**
- **Eruptions**: The ground itself erupted with boiling geysers, spewing scalding water and steam, further devastating the land and adding to the chaos.
- **New Terrain**: These eruptions altered the geography of the land, creating craters filled with boiling water and transforming once-fertile areas into steaming marshlands.

## **Consequences**

### **Destruction of the Blessed Realm**
- **Collapse**: [[The Blessed Realm]], once a powerful and prosperous kingdom, was utterly destroyed. Its cities lay in ruins, and its population was decimated.
- **Loss of Knowledge and Culture**: Much of the kingdom's knowledge, culture, and history was lost in the destruction. Libraries, temples, and cultural artifacts were consumed by the flames and chaos.

- **Remnants**: The surviving inhabitants of [[The Blessed Realm]] now live in scattered settlements, holding onto the remnants of their culture and striving to rebuild.

### **Environmental Impact**
- **Altered Landscape**: The land that was once [[The Blessed Realm]] is now a collection of craters, boiling lakes, and steaming marshes. The fertile plains and rolling hills have been transformed into a harsh and inhospitable environment.
- **Climate Change**: The Flaming Retribution caused significant changes in the local climate, with increased volcanic activity and ash clouds affecting weather patterns.

### **New Beginnings**
- **Rebuilding**: The survivors of the Flaming Retribution are determined to rebuild and create a new society. They carry with them the lessons learned from their ancestors' mistakes, striving to avoid repeating the same errors.
- **Hope and Renewal**: The aftermath of the Flaming Retribution, while devastating, also represents an opportunity for renewal and growth. The survivors see it as a chance to forge a new path, guided by the principles of [[Raythelion]] and the lessons of the past.

### ⚔️ **The Giant Wars**

The Giant Wars were a defining conflict in [[Dwarves|dwarven]] history—an era of blood, stone, and survival. Long before the [[Flaming Retribution]], the [[dwarves]] of [[Ironhold]] faced a rising threat from the [[Giant]] tribes of the north. These towering beings, forged in elemental fury and loyal to [[The Dark Pantheon]] of [[Erabose]], sought dominion over the surface and the deep places of the world.

The [[Giant]]s were not mindless brutes. They were organized, tribal, and devout—worshiping cruel elemental gods and wielding magic that twisted the land itself. Though they allied with [[Vorath the Betrayer]] during [[The War of Fractured Dawn]], their loyalty was never to him. They served only their gods and their own vision of conquest.

The war was long and brutal. Entire [[Dwarves|dwarven]] holds were shattered. Mountains burned. Rivers froze. But the [[Dwarves]] endured. Through unity, sacrifice, and unmatched craftsmanship, they drove the [[Giant]]s to the brink of extinction.

By the end of the Third Age, the [[Giant]]s were believed to be wiped from the face of [[Aetheria]]—scattered, broken, and buried beneath the ruins of their own ambition.

Their temples are silent. Their bones are dust.  
Or so the [[Dwarves]] believe.

# Factions
![[Order-of-the-Blessed-realm.webp]]

The Order of the Blessed Realm was a once-prominent organization in the Sun Kingdom, known for being the bringers of enlightenment. Originally migrating from the south, they shared advancements in agriculture, technology, and the ways of true magic with the people of Solaris.

Over time, however, the Order began to impose lordship over the free peoples of Solaris rather than acting as peaceful guides. They abandoned their old ways and started practicing new forms of worship. Prophets of Raythelion foretold of impending doom, but the inhabitants ignored the warnings and punished the mouthpieces of the great god Raythelion, leading to their downfall.

The Order's stronghold, the Blessed Kingdom, was destroyed by the Flaming Retribution, a catastrophic event that left the once-great kingdom in ruins. With the destruction of the Blessed Realm, the Order ceased to exist, becoming a relic of the past.

Raythelion emerged as the first light, shattering the primordial darkness and establishing the cosmic order. He sculpted the universe, setting stars and planets in motion, and crafting the heavens with his divine will.

This brought to an end the Golden Age of [[The Blessed Realm]] and in order to save the world, they were forced to put all the [[La Pelu]] to the sword.

So too does your divine presence illuminate our hearts,
Guiding us along the path of righteousness,
And filling our souls with warmth and hope.

And bless us with your divine grace,
Now and forevermore.
Amen.

# Species
## 🛡️ **The Dwarves of [[Aetheria]]**

The dwarves of [[Aetheria]] are a proud, enduring people shaped by stone, fire, and tradition. Their civilization is ancient, rooted in the deep places of the world, and defined by resilience in the face of catastrophe. When the [[Flaming Retribution]] scorched the surface, the dwarves of [[Ironhold]] sealed their gates and survived—alone, but unbroken.

Dwarven society is structured around powerful [[Ironhold#The Clans of Ironhold|clans]], each with its own function, traditions, and political influence. These clans are tight-knit and proud, [[Ironhold#The Clans of Ironhold|clans]] loyalties that span generations. Some are warriors, others scholars, engineers, merchants, mystics, or scouts. A rare few walk without clan, either by choice or exile, and are viewed with a mix of suspicion and respect.

Politically, the dwarves are divided between two major factions:

- **Isolationists**, who believe [[Ironhold]] should remain sealed and self-sufficient.
- **Expansionists**, who support [[King Hargrin Deepmantle]]’s vision of reclaiming the surface and rebuilding dwarven influence.

Though the dwarves are deeply spiritual, they do not worship a unique pantheon. Instead, they revere select gods from the broader divine orders—especially those tied to craftsmanship, endurance, and elemental mastery. Their most honored deities include:

- **[[Durnhal]], the Forgefather**
- **[[Gemmara]], the Artisan’s Eye**
- **[[Karnun]], the Gearwright**
- **[[Thalgrun]], Lord of Flame**
- **[[Varnok]], the Stoneheart**
- **[[Aelra]], Mistress of Flow**

The dwarves also remember the **[[Giant Wars]]**, a brutal conflict in which they drove the giant tribes to the brink of extinction. Though the giants once allied with [[The Dark Pantheon]], the dwarves believe their threat has long since passed.

Now, with the gates of [[Ironhold]] open once more, the dwarves stand at a crossroads—between tradition and ambition, isolation and expansion, memory and legacy.

## **The Giants of Aetheria: Servants of the Dark Pantheon**

### 🗻 **Core Belief**

The giants are ancient, malevolent beings who believe they were forged to dominate the mortal world. They are **devout servants of the Dark Pantheon**, particularly **Erabose**, whom they revere as the rightful sovereign of all divine power. Their elemental gods are not neutral forces of nature—they are **corrupted reflections** of elemental power, twisted by shadow and ambition.

The giants see themselves as the **chosen instruments of divine ruin**, and their society is built around conquest, domination, and the worship of **dark elemental deities** who serve Erabose’s will.

---

## 🕯️ **Relationship to Vorath**

Vorath, as a fallen La Pelu, was never a god—merely a powerful demigod. The giants allied with him during the War of the Fractured Dawn because his goals aligned with theirs: the destruction of the divine orders and the collapse of mortal empires. But they never served him. Their loyalty has always been to the **true gods of the Dark Pantheon**.

---

## 🔥 **The Dark Elemental Gods of the Giants**

These gods are **fully aligned with Erabose**, and their worship is central to giant culture. Each tribe may elevate one above the others, but all are venerated as aspects of divine ruin.

## Goblins
Little Green creatures with a mean streak in them that have a preponderancy to like to see things explode.

# Fire Walker Tribe
This group of Goblins are marked by their skin. it is Green with what look to be red mud cracks in their skin. They are a tribe of Goblins that have subjugated themselves to a Coven of Hags that go by the same name. 

The fire walker tribe are Ruthless and deviant. They long for nothing but the destruction of Civilization and Brother hood. They are held together by a rough amount of rules. They respect strength and acknowledge that the Coven that they serve is more powerful than they are, and so they serve them. Should the coven ever be broken than the Tribe will likely fall into chaos, where either they all destroy each other or one creature rises to the top as the undisputed powerhouse of the tribe.
## Slavery
The Fire Walker Tribe has no problem with slavery and are more than happy to find other species and even other Goblin tribes to subjugate and enslave. They will often use these slaves as Fodder for battle during times of war.

# [[The Burned Wood]]
The Goblins of [[The Burned Wood]] are a collection of a number of different tribes. They were warring tribes in the Goblin Lands and were forced into Slavery by [[#Fire Walker Tribe]].

# The Cracked Granite: Adventure Information
# Session Transcripts
# Session 00
Try six Yeah. The game is paused because I have it paused. So And you're recording. And I'm recording, so I can keep track of what decisions you guys make and be able to plan accordingly. I do have an adventure, but I do also like to use my players' back stories and different things that they've come up with to kinda help them along.

So, as you guys know, we are playing, team dwarf. So, we are this adventure itself, the craft granite is going to be taking place in the, Northern Mountain Range of do do I have it, but not readily available. But it's in the northern it's in the Northwestern Mountain Range of, Solaris. So kind of like where you guys were on the map, where you guys were on the map, Northwest. There's a big mountain range on the Western side.

This is in the Northwestern Mountains. The name of the community, is Iron Hold. And I have before we start building characters, I do have a little, a little introduction, to read that may help influence your decisions and things. So, so I'll go ahead and get started with that, and then we can start talking characters. So, when the flaming retribution scores the surface of the world, the dwarves did not burn.

They sealed their gates, reinforced their falls, and endured. For a year, Ironhold remained silent. Its people surviving by stone, steel, and stubborn and stubborn will. Now the gates have opened. Ironhold is a kingdom of clans.

Each clan has its own traditions, its own strengths, miners, warriors, scholars, traders, mystics, and scouts. Some dwarves are born into these clans. Others walk alone clanless, but without per both, not without purpose. King Hargren Deepmantle believes in believes the time has come to reclaim the surface. He sent out colonies, small footholds in the wilds to reestablish dwarven presence in the world.

Not all agree. Two factions now shape Ironhold's future. Isolationists believe their surface is still cur the surface is still cursed and that Ironhold must remain sealed and self sufficient. Expansionists believe that the world is ripe for reclamation, and the dwarves must rise again as builders and rulers. Tensions simmer, old grudges stir, and the fate of Ironhold may rest in the hands of those willing to walk beyond the granite walls.

You are dwarves of renown, adventurers, soldiers, champions. You are not bound by politics, but you are trusted to act with strength, wisdom, and honor. Before you choose your path, ask yourself, what plan do you hail from, or are you a planless, and what what do you believe Ironforge should become? The stone endures, but even stone can crack. So the thought behind this adventure is there are these political under undercurrents in Ironhold itself.

You are adventurers or soldiers or, you know, people that have made yourselves, made yourselves, known in the halls of Ironhold, as you've as you've done other things, hence the, hence the level three. In this, you the the adventure itself is going to be is going to be more of an exploration based adventure, with potential political undertones. So that's basically kind of what you're looking at as far as, like, you know, character creation, that kind of stuff. If you want, if you're building as you're building, you know, that those are those are the those are the tones of what the adventure is is gonna is going to be or at least my idea of what it's going to be. You may decide to turn my ideas on their head The first five minutes, that would start playing, but, you know, here we are.

So with that, does anybody have any ideas as far as, like, what class that they would want to, play from a dwarven purse from from that perspective at least. I'm assuming that we're not gonna be isolationists or whatever that clan was. You could be. You know? And you don't have to choose the same as the other people.

You know? You could have a separate you could be an isolationist working alongside the expansionists, or you could be somebody who's kind of, like, walking the line in between, seeing seeing value in both. You're not restricted. I don't see value in the isolation. That's interesting.

I was over oh, go ahead, Jason. I just said, oh, that's interesting. Alright. So I was I was overthinking it, and now I just think I'm gonna be a fighter. That's what I was thinking.

Well, there there ain't nothing wrong with just being a fighter. That's definitely, that's definitely a good class to choose for sure. Does spider in this in this, setting have the the flexibility that it it seemed to have in in D and D? It does, and it's actually a better fighter than most other martial classes. Okay.

Like, the the fighter in that direction myself. Okay. Group of dwarven fighters. Here we go. It's the habit.

Think back to all the That's why. Okay. Okay. So, Ramses. I mean So, Jason, I've given you two opportunities.

Ranger or barbarian or paladin? What do you think? Nah. Claret. Claret.

There you go. Probably not. I could be a ranger as well if nobody you need if we needed one. No. Well, we don't need nothing.

You wanna be a fighter, be a fighter. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep.

Yeah. I'm doing everything right now. Chris, what were you saying? Oh, I was just gonna say, Pathfinder well, I'm the this what I was saying to response to, you know, I you can switch classes. Like, Pathfinder is one of the few classes or few games where party composition doesn't really matter all that much.

I mean, it's still, you know, it's still relatively important, but at the same time, it's not necessarily, like, a it it it's not it's not the end of the world if we don't have a healer. And it's not the end of the world if we don't have a, if we don't have an arcane caster and, you know, you could do an you could do an entire group of nothing but fighters if you wanted to. Yeah. No. And I I've again, with the flexibility of the fighter in my head, you you can you can build a pretty diverse group with just fighters.

Yeah. Well, I'm I I will say Not that that's the way to do it, but it there Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think it still could.

I I I would I would say that if it depends on what you're trying to do as to whether or not the fighter is the be all and end all. Like, if you're if you want to do a sword and board guy or maybe a two handed weapon person, the fighter is a really good pick because they get a plus two on their on their to hit versus other classes. So you the chance of you creating is a little bit is is higher. But, if you're wanting to be a better, you know, a better shoot shooter, a gunslinger is by far the better pick. If you wanna if you wanna have tracking capability and woodsman and and woods and wood lore and that kind of stuff, Ranger is extremely powerful and also a very good pick.

So, like, if, like, in in D and D three five, I think there was just kind of, like, everybody had to dip into fighter a little bit because you got you got a bunch of free feats and that kind of stuff, but you could really kind of make your fighter into whatever you wanted. You've got a little bit of that here, and there is more flexibility with the fighter. You can have two fighters that don't look anything like each other, and that kind of thing. But if you're going for a specific flavor, fighter is a soldier. So if you're not wanting to do a soldier type character, then, you know, you it might not be best flavor.

Does that make sense? I see what you're saying. Yep. Yep. Yep.

Did I did I mangle any of that up, Ramsey, or do you have anything to add on that? Nope. That that that sounds correct. Okay. I guess my my question and not to dissuade anybody, but when you say you wanna make a dwarf fighter, like, what do you envision them doing?

Because to Chris's point, there may be something better than fighter. I don't I don't know that I have a vision beyond Okay. Oh, it is a dwarf. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. And let's let's make him good with a hammer. Sure. You know, something of that nature.

I think I was thinking the quest was gonna be somewhat of we're finding stuff. So that's why I was kinda torn between fighter and ranger. Yeah. If we were going further areas or just find the, you know, that the land is inhabitable and maybe some mountain we were gonna find to, like, relocate our people to or something like that. That's why I thought Ranger might be cool too.

But I wonder because where did you put out, Chris, the like, you put out the classes. There's, like, 25 somewhere, but didn't you put somewhere, like, hey. These are the ones to look at, like, 10 or eight or something like that? Yeah. I sent out a player in discord.

And yeah. But I can just read off the the ones that were the ones that were common classes that that dwarves pick. There's fighter, cleric, ranger, inventor, champion, rogue, gunslinger, kineticist, and wizard. And really, I mean, when it comes to when it comes to class selection, like, you can make a dwarf that's good at dang near anything, but a dwarf does have a lower, charisma. So charisma based classes, are at a detriment for a dwarf.

Doesn't mean that they're terrible. There's they'll still be good. They just won't be as good as somebody who's not necessarily charisma based. So the the ones that I listed off, those ones are more those ones are either strength, dexterity, constitution, or intelligence based classes. What's an exemplar?

I'll get it. An exemplar is a, that is a, that's what Clark wants to be. It's it's basically a, a character that has the divine spark inside of them. So, like, basically, the basically, a god granted you or you found something that awakened a divine spark in you. So you're a you're a pseudo demigod.

Okay. I can't be that. Hard boiled. Against my religion. Who didn't know that?

Can dwarves be monks? Dwarves can be monks. Dwarves make great monks. Just tough because the fighter is an expert in all the weapons already. True.

True. And like like I said at the beginning, like, if you wanna if you want if both Jason and if Jason, both you and Scott wanna play fighters, play fighters. Don't feel like you have to pick something different. That's perfectly fine. What are you thinking, Ramsey?

Sure. I'm between a few things. Are are we doing any optional stuff or nah? I'm assuming nah. But we are, actually.

Okay. We're doing the free archetype. Okay. And we are doing, we're doing the, the, ancestral paragon. Okay.

And I'm trying out the instead of the automatic bonus progression, I'm trying out the automatic rune progression with this instead, which I don't know if you're familiar, but basically, effectively what it does is it does a similar thing as automatic bonus progression, but it just grants weapon and armor runes over time. And it doesn't remove the item bonuses from anything. It's just like you just automatically get the item bonuses for your for your for your, base level runes on your weapons and armor. So Gotcha. Okay.

So slightly different than automatic bonus progression, bonus progression, where it removes item bonuses and then grant you certain things at certain levels. This just grants you automatic automatic base level runes. So Gotcha. Makes sense. And also, if people are having a hard time figuring out which thing they want to pick, keep in mind, I I run pretty loose with the this character didn't work the way I wanted.

I wanna do something different. So don't feel like you're stuck with the one with the one thing. I want you to I want you to be playing something that you wanna play and not be stuck with something that you don't wanna play. So you can you can feel free to be a little bit more, a little bit more decisive in your in your choosings just because you have the freedom to go back and retro and retrofit anything. Like, if you choose a class, you're like, I don't like this class.

We'll figure it out. So Is is Clark's, character a champion? Is that what he was? He is. Yep.

Okay. Chris, I'm just and this Yeah. Go ahead, Jace. Or go ahead, Scott. We've got clans of Ironhole.

Do we have to pick the same clan, or are we from different clans? You are from different clans. You guys are people that have rose in through the ranks in a you you have rose in through the ranks as a as a person of renown, as a dwarf of renown. You are aware of each other. Maybe you've worked you you've aware you are aware of each other, and you have worked together in the past.

But it doesn't necessarily mean that you are, like, teammates right this very minute. You can be, but you don't have to be. Okay. I think it would stretch me further to try to be a ranger, and I need to stretch myself when it comes to RPGs. I'm not quite ready to be a wizard.

Nobody really is quite ready to be a wizard. Right. God. Being a wizard is is its own unique, fun, little mini game. But, no, you should be ranger.

Okay. Loving it. What is what is this kineticist? I'm I'm not The kinetisist is it's it's it's kind of this it it's weird is what it is. It's basically a it's a class where you are infused with certain elements.

There are six elements in Pathfinder. There's fire there's fire, earth, air, and water, but there's also metal and wood as well. And as a kinetics, you attune yourself to one of those elements or two of those elements because you can do two, and you use powers that are called impulses that, basically shape those elements. If you're at all familiar with, Avatar, the the last airbender, like that sort of stuff, like, that's kind of what Kinesis is. Okay.

Okay. Yeah. I didn't think you would be Scott. What's kind of part of it about analysis is they are the how to say this? Not melee, but they are like the martial version of a spell caster.

Yeah. Jason. Like, you you pick, you know, a very, very small number of abilities. Like, I think at level three, you'll have, like, three abilities, but you could use them all day every day. You could use them whenever you want.

But they, like, mimic spells of your chosen element. Gotcha. But you don't have to worry about spell slots and all that hot garbage. Gotcha. Sounds interesting.

They are pretty cool. They are they're also, like, one of the I think they are the only class that their primary attribute is constitution. Mhmm. So I believe that's correct. So they're tough mofos.

Mhmm. Okay. Having an issue with my camera. Cool. Yeah.

Sounds sounds splendid. Okay. Where do we begin? Alright. So it sound Ramsey, it sounds like we got a ranger and a kinetics.

What do you want? We went from two fighters to a ranger and a kinetics assist. Sure. Absolutely. It's your opportunity to pick gunslinger for the wing for the wing.

Scott, are you, Scott, are you thinking, melee ranger or ranged ranger? Who I was thinking more melee ranger, like, what combination thereof? So Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yep. Okay. Okay. But I also saw something about giant wars, and I'm afraid that we don't have enough power to kill the giants.

Oh, that's literally what the ranger is for. It is very much what the ranger is for in more ways than one. You are not going to have nearly as much damage that you do in one attack as a ranger as a from the barbarian, but you're still gonna be doing a ton of damage. So and who knows? Maybe you will do as much damage.

I don't know. I've never actually seen a ranger played. So possible that they pump out as much damage as barbarian, but No. It's not fun for you, Chris, if you crit and kill the person in one blow. So we're going away from that.

We're we're moving aside. Okay. Woah. Woah. Are you rolling dice?

You may even have characters yet. I was just checking out what theme I need. Oh, are you down, like, in your settings? Yeah. So, Ramsey, did we break you?

Well, I'm just trying to decide. The the things I'm between are now different. You want me to just you do you want number to them, and do you want me to pick a number or see if you like it? I'll figure it out. Go go go ahead and get started.

I can assume that we catch catch up. Alright. So we'll go ahead and connect to the right computer. Mhmm. Okay.

So to get started, everybody, let's build some characters. So what you're gonna wanna do is go over to the, excuse me, go over the right hand side where the actors are and underneath party, the party, you will see a person with a plus sign on it, I think. Maybe. Okay. Yeah.

There was. Okay. So if you click on that being the thing. If you click on that, you will officially you'll have a actor that gets created. And then at that point, like, you don't necessarily have to come up with a name right at that very minute.

You can just click on create actor and it'll, it'll automatically assign player character to it, or you could put in your name just to keep just to keep things going. But in a character, have a blank character sheet that's pop that pops up. Let me know when you have the blank character sheet. I have a blank character sheet. Alright.

Ancestry dwarf. Yep. So first thing you wanna do is is pick the pick the magnifying glass and then dwarf is the first entry on the thing. Just click on the green check mark and that will add it. And then it'll give you a selection about whether or not you are, doing a clan dagger or a clan pistol.

Your clan, grants you at childbirth, it gives you a dagger or a pistol. And it's basically kind of like kind of like an ancestral art. It's an ancestral artifacts sort of thing. It's a very good knife, and it's not really like terribly game breaking. But you have to choose whether or not you're gonna wanna have a dagger or a pistol.

Once you make that selection, you will have to Sorry, Chris. Yes. Oh, you were naming your character? I named my character. I have a blank character sheet, so I think I'm in the same spot that Scott is.

But, Right. I'll So same. Okay. So you need to click on the magnifying glass next to the and pick the green check mark next to dwarf with the pop up. Magnifying glass next to ancestry.

Ancestry. Okay. Let's pick the dwarf. And then you have an option of a clan pistol or a clan dagger. Just pick one.

If you think you'll use a pistol more, get a get a pistol. If you think you'll be more melee, get a dagger. It's generally the the thing to go with. Okay. Sorry.

Alright. Thank you. Yep. So once you've gotten your ancestry, now it's time to pick your heritage. So if you go to the check mark checkbox next to your heritage, that will bring up all of the dwarf heritages plus any plus any all of the, all of the, what are they called?

Versatile heritages, which are the things like the dragon the dragon blooded, the Asammar, the half orc, and that kind of stuff. But the first things that you're presented are going to be specifically dwarf things. So you can pick any one of those. And if you're not sure which one to pick or you wanna know more information, that's the check mark. There's a little little notepad.

If you click on that, it'll pop open the it'll pop open a description. Any references to any proper named characters may or may not be correct, but you can at least get the general gist of of what the of which dwarf ancestry or which dwarf heritage you want. And I'm just, I I I don't know, Jason. I don't know if this is the the right call or not, but since you're playing in Kineticis, there's this elemental heart dwarf. Seems like it might go well.

What goes well with my guy? Let's see. You're a ranger. Well, I mean, really, any of these could work. Between ancient blooded and brown blooded?

Let me take a look here. Strong blooded seems like it would be good for a ranger. Let me take a look at that ancient blooded. In ancient blood it just seems like it'd be good for anyone. Not really, specific.

Let me just take another look at strong blood. Okay. So strong blooded is, like, really, really, really good against poison. Like, if you get poisoned, like, you reduce the stage of the poison by two for every for every successful saving throw. You gain poison resistance equal to half your level.

So, I mean, as far as, like, like, it's super strong against poison. Poison isn't everywhere in the game though, but, like, if Right. You ever get poisoned, like, that that would be that would be a killer heritage for. Sounds fun. You you can bring it in.

Yeah. Well, if you get resistance against poison, guess what? Poison's gotta be showing up. That's just So poison my comrades? Maybe.

Maybe. Oh, no. There's a lot of backgrounds. Okay. So backgrounds backgrounds are kinda kinda tricky here.

There are tons and tons and tons. In general, kind of what I do when I'm looking at backgrounds, is I actually go to archives of Memphis. And I look at the backgrounds in there, and then sort them by, like, a background that'll give my that will give my primary attribute a boost. But most backgrounds and I'm gonna I'll just send that over. Most backgrounds will give you a free boost.

So even if it doesn't work for your primary attribute, it's something that you could, make make your second primary your your second attribute work for it. But, Where's my Where? What is my primary attribute? For a ranger for a melee ranger, really, it it depends, but it could be either agility or strength. If you're planning on on hitting things with hammers, it's probably a strength.

And give me one second, and I can pop it up in the chat here. But, also, another very valid tactic when it comes to when it comes to, backgrounds is just pick it on vibes. Just go through and be like, I feel like my character would I feel like this would be a fun background for my character to have. That totally works as well. Because generally, you can make it work for your primary attribute.

As an example, like, just picking on vibes kind of thing. Like Scott as a as a ranger, animal whisperer might be a good one. Animal wrangler could be another one. Let's see what else. Sea deep diver or a deep sea diver could be one, although you are out in the mountains, so that would be kinda weird.

But, demon slayer for that? Scout is a good one. Yeah. Scout would be perfect for you. Early explorer could be a good one too, and that would be a good one for, like, you know, kinetics as well.

Field medic could be useful for anyone. Fireworks performer could work for the kinetics, especially if you're doing fire gate. Gambler could be fun. Gladiator. Card.

Hunter. Like, I mean, you could also use this to kind of shore up something, like, if you're if it doesn't necessarily vibe with your class, but it's something that you want your class to be good at, or you want your character to be good at, you can pick a different background that might help help facilitate that. Jeweler. That's if you wanna be more spooky. Or it could be fun.

I think I'm gonna pick night watch unless you say it's terrible. Go for it. Secular medic. So if I choose my class as a ranger. Yep.

Select a hunter's edge. Right. So this is your subclass. Studying and vindicator. Okay.

Yep. So this is your subclass. Ranger, So you've trained to become a skilled hunter and tracker, gaining an extra benefit when you hunt prey depending on the focus of your training. Choose a hunter's edge. I would love to.

There we go. Right. So you really have you've got four different edges. So the flurry ranger is a dual wielding, ranger. Gives you the ability to hit a bunch of times.

So you you are able to, you're able to hit more often, more accurately with your second and third attacks and that kind of thing. Out which Because between flurry and provision or precision. Excuse me. Yeah. Precision is because I'm thinking flurry because dwarfs aren't like I mean, a ranger maybe is a little bit more precise, but dwarfs are kind of like a bludgeoning scenario.

Dwarfs could be they could be they could be pretty precise if they wanna be. They don't think things that But zero. No. Yeah. Or at least But, no.

Yeah. No. Flurry is flurry is definitely not a bad route to go for Ranger. That's that's one of the one. That that's definitely a a a good a good thing to do.

Yeah. I could see precision too because it's a Ranger. But Yep. I mean, it takes precision to wash all those dishes. You went and washed the hobbit.

You saw how precise they were. Right. Precision in the chaos. Alright. Jason, how are you doing with the backgrounds?

Sifting. Sifting. It would be nice if there were a few less. I'm guessing that many, many of them grant the same basic bonuses or whatever. They do.

So it was like Right. Because you could just consolidate them in into fewer things and and Well trying to create the story. Yeah. It's it's calling out that flavor. So they all have similar bonuses.

Like, I mean, you've only got, like, six attributes. Right? So those ones are those ones are matched. But every but but the backgrounds also grant additional powers, and that's kind of where the where the rubber hits the road. But like I said before, don't feel like you have to pick the right thing here.

I would say just go just go pick on vibes and, like, if you're like, oh, I want my character to be this sort of person. I mean, give them that background, and then just try it out. See and if it didn't work out for you, then we can switch it out. So I don't know which d and d to pick. There's, like, a thousand.

Yeah. Don't feel like you have to get one. And I did and I didn't actually bring in any of the ones that I that I created for the setting in here. So if you do, you know, feel so don't feel like you need to pick a deity, but if you wanna have a a deity that your character serves, then just kinda let me know and I'll make sure that that's included in here. So don't don't feel like you have to worry about that.

So when I was picking things like night watch, it said you had to pick strength and then something else. Like, is that in our proficiencies? Or does that automatically happen? It will be in your attributes where where that where that goes. So, so if you go to the bottom of that first page where you've got attribute modifiers, the exit or the edit button, not the exit button, the edit button should be highlighted orange.

If you click on that, that will pop up a dialogue with your boosts. So you've got your dwarven stuff in there already. You basically just need to pick one additional boost in your dwarven stuff, then your background should be on there as well, and your class will be on there as well. Okay. And that should just kinda walk you through it.

If you look at the left hand side, you'll be able to tell how many picks you've got left, because there'll be a circle with a number in it. Alright. Now it's time to pick class, Jason. So when you choose the kinet assist, you will have an option of a single gate or a dual gate kinet assist. And basically what that means is, if you're a single gate kineticsis, then you have one element that your character can interact with and bend.

Your dual gate, you've got two. So it just depends on whether or not you wanna have only this elemental power or if you wanna have two different elemental powers. The single gate gate are really powerful in their own individual, like, element, and the dual gate are less are are more versatile. So that's kind of basically what what the what the difference is. I'm usually one who tries to be, versatile, so I should probably just choose a single gate.

Okay. It's just so hard to do. It's so hard to do. Because Duo just sounds like so much more fun. Do it.

Yeah. Why not? You would have to make one more decision in that, but, you know I know. Right? All the decisions.

At the end of the day, sort of course, interesting. Gosh, you start choosing feats. Yeah. So if you're finished with your attributes, then at that point, we will move on to your let's do proficiencies just to make sure that you've got those in there. Your initial proficiencies as a ranger, at first level, you gain a number of proficiencies equal to, perception saving through skills.

Here we go. So you are automatically trained in nature. You're automatically trained in survival, and you have a number of additional skills equal to four plus your intelligence modifier. So you can be trained in four plus your intelligence modifier skills, on top of nature and survival. So my intelligence is plus one, so I just get four?

You get five. Okay. How close is that? Somebody's attacking somebody. You can go with an easy one, could you, Ramsey?

I don't know what you're talking about, Chris. I just snuck a peek. I see what's going down here. I was between this and Gunslinger, to be fair, so it was either gonna be real simple or real complicated. I'm gonna have to get some summoner stuff.

Idle on this. Idle on that. Alright. Right. Right?

But I realized the gunslinger I wanted to play, was kind of similar to, like, the monk gun wielder I was playing in the D and D game the one time. So I'm like, I kinda already did that. Fair enough. Oh, wait. Wait.

Wait. Wait. So that's the reason I'm not doing it. I chose five things to be trained in, Chris. Okay.

They have I'm skipping deity. Okay? Yeah. Skip it. Not okay.

Okay. That's perfectly fine. Okay. Age. How how old should a dwarf be?

They are if if they they live to I, like, I think they can make it up to, like, 500 or something like that. You know? So if you're looking for somebody who's a little bit more of a more of a young dwarf, I'd be looking for somebody in their early hundreds, maybe. Alright, Scott. So Pergan has all of his proficiencies.

So now let's go ahead and jump into feats. So you know how this works. So just go ahead and Mhmm. Do your thing. We're choosing level one?

Yeah. We're choosing level one for now, and then we'll, and we'll level up as we go. Alright. We have what was your what which dates did you choose, Jason? I think I, chose one.

Oh, you did a metal? Yes. Nice. Seems seems pretty dwarfy. Yes.

That does track. Yes. So it's a metal and or, earth. Stone. Yeah.

Yeah. Earth or fire. Any of those Yeah. Fire. Yeah.

All three of those sound very dwarvish. And so I was debating about going between, if I did a dual, I was gonna do fire and and earth. Mhmm. Mhmm. But I chose against the dual dual Okay.

So, Jason, let's go ahead and do your proficiencies as well. And what we have for skills is you are trained in nature by default. I guess so. And you and athletics, it looks like. I think that was probably your background that did that.

Something. Yeah. Okay. And you get to choose three plus your intelligence modifier skills to be trained in on top of that. Since I have no intelligence, I guess, three.

How do I have to always be so stupid? Okay. So What am I doing here? Am I just increasing the already trained things? Or No.

You are choosing something. Yeah. You're choosing three separate skills to be trained in that you're not already trained in. Okay. Oh, no.

Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. I cannot kill it.

Chris, can you kill it? For what? My character. I'm all going I can't I can't kill me. Oh, I'm I'm I will delete your character?

Yes. Yes. Final answer. Okay. I'm I'm going gunslinger.

Oh. I'm just wondering what happened. I was look I was looking up I was looking at my proficiencies, and I'm like, I'm playing a Charisma caster. Like, I'm already my other character is a Charisma caster. Like, yes.

Summoner's different, but, like, I am like, oh, I'm just gonna be diplomacy and fricking deception again. And and all. No. No. No.

That's not what we wanna do. Fair enough. It can be intimidating. I mean, that's true. I can't.

Alright. Alright. Okay. Cool. Okay.

That could be cool. And, oh, no. Okay. So how are we looking, Scott? Plus.

There I just like them all, Chris. These feats, I really like the mountain strategy. Well, something to consider, as a as a dwarven paragon, you get access to two feats for the dwarven paragon. So pick your two favorites. Okay.

I guess I don't understand what you just said. So I have one empty slot in the ancestor fee? Yeah. But if you look down, if you scroll down, there's the ancestry Paragon fee? It's the same Okay.

The same group. Same group. K. Yeah. So if you've got two things that you like and you're having trouble choosing, just take them both.

And it doesn't matter if you're three or more I got. Rare or uncommon or nothing in the Well, generally, with a rare one And or an uncommon one, you wanna clear it with me first. But anything that isn't, anything that like, I I would say anything that's uncommon or lower, I'm gonna clear those immediately. If you've got something that's rare that you want, let's talk, and I'll you know, I won't be a jerk about it. So I, I need to do ability modifiers or whatever you wanna call those.

Oh, yeah. Yeah. Bonuses. Yes. I didn't I didn't do those.

So when I'm I'm looking at this, my Mhmm. Seeing it correctly, the dwarf automatically, you know, does the constitution, the wisdom. Right. And then I have one one to choose there Yes. In that in that role there.

Okay. Mhmm. Knowing nothing about what my guy is doing or what he is. I have no idea what he is. Even Mhmm.

Is there is there an attribute where I really wanna put a little extra focus? Or well, kinetics are I don't think they're heavily armored, so can't go wrong with can't go wrong with little decks. Fair. Metal Kineticist can be. Oh, never mind.

Never mind. Can armor. I don't know if I chose the armor. I might not have chosen the armor. Yeah.

Yeah. One of one of the metal kinetics's abilities, like, their spells, quote unquote, essentially is just bam. You have armor. Yeah. Okay.

Yep. But if you did choose that, then, yes, decks, very good. But, otherwise, I mean, if if you if you're if you're not running into an armor specific issue, then, like, I mean, I don't know. Maybe maybe intelligence? You know?

It I don't imagine that you're gonna be using a lot of you're gonna be hitting things over the head, like, with your fist much, but maybe. So it just kinda depends on what you wanna do on top of it. Okay. The thrill seeker, I have to choose either strength or constitution. Right.

And you want and you wanna choose con for all of your available boosts anyway. You wanna max out con as much as possible because that's what your kinetics abilities are based off of. Oh. Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah.

That could be helpful. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Alright.

So chose constitution for everything. Yes. Alright. Yeah. And really, I mean, it just kinda depends on, like, kind of how you see your character fitting in the group.

Like, if he's going to be more of a more of an intelligence based investigator type than maybe going intelligence. If you see him being more of a, more of, like, you know, a somebody who is, you know, getting into tight situations and getting out by the skin of their teeth and that kind of stuff. Maybe, maybe Dex or if he's like a heavy lifter, really, you know, likes punching things in the face, then go strength. Or you could do wisdom too. Wisdom would be would be solid, for the rest of your picks.

But or pick a few of or pick one of one of a few. You know? So do you see him being more of, like, an Indiana Jones archaeologist type of of thrill seeker? Because if he's that way, then maybe going heavier in intelligence. Mhmm.

I see. Or if he's more of, like, an Evel Knievel sort of thrill seeker, then maybe doing the Yeah. I guess I kinda that. I kinda saw it a little bit more that line of thinking there. Okay.

Yeah. Then then just drop it in decks. You know? It might it it might not affect you from an armor perspective, but I'm sure it'll help with with other skills and things if you're planning on doing that sort of stuff. Okay.

Hey, Chris. Yeah. Under my Ancestry Piergon feeds Mhmm. There's a lot. It's It's different than the Ancestry feats.

Okay. Let me see if I can get over there and just The guy chose the mountain strategy for the entry feats. Oh, that's because it's not the ancestor ancestor paragon isn't, isn't filtering. So what you need to do is go into the, trait section on the the the trait field on the left hand side and type in dwarf. War.

Got it. And that should pull in all your level one or fee things. Okay. Okay. So how in this, efficiencies area here Mhmm.

How do I know? Because it's not giving me a marker saying, hey. Here's the limit that you are allowed on on these in the in this skills area proficiencies. Yeah. It's Yeah.

It's not going to. It doesn't have any automations around that. You just need to you just need to be honest. So for your character, you've got you've got, nature plus three plus your intelligence modifier skills. Right.

Which is so I need two more. So Yeah. Okay. And a little losses. Where'd it go from there?

So next up is feats. So go to your feet section. But, what's the difference between acrobatics and athletics? Athletics is I would have athletics. Things.

Why would I choose acrobatics? Acrobatics allows you to do things that are more graceful. Like, if you needed to squeeze, squeeze through a tight area, that would be an acrobatics check. If you needed to run across a narrow ledge, that would be an acrobatics check. If you needed to, there's a specific combat action called tumble through that allows you to get on the other side of a bad guy by tumbling through their legs that legs that would be an athletic or an acrobatics.

So those sorts of things are what the acrobatics are versus the athletics, which is just like sheer muscle. Like Gotcha. You can jump high. You can pull you can carry heavy objects. You can win tug of war, you know, that kind of stuff.

Suggestions on the last one. I don't I picked all the ones. I'm like, I would, like, care about this one. Okay. In your demo lore?

I'm I'm trying to avoid survival, believing that that's gonna be taken care of by Oregon? Well, something that could be handy. Thievery might be a good one. Your, if, you know, that that could be used for picking locks, disabling traps, you know, it doesn't mean that you're it doesn't mean that you that you're just straight up a thief with a thievery skill. It just means that you're, you know, you've you're you're nimble with your hands.

Right? Yeah. Okay. Sounds good. Check me out, Chris.

Make sure I did everything right. I have to, just look at the time. I have to step out. My kids are at VBS. I gotta get them picked up, and I will be back home.

So I'm gonna be out for about, twenty minutes. Okay. See you when I get back. I'm sure Ramsey will fill two or three characters by then. Maybe.

Might make that summoner after all after this. Ramsey, you should just be a fighter. I should all just been fighters. Team fighter. Kind of a fighter.

Yeah. Gunslinger though. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. No, that's great. Gunslinger is a little bit more of a what? Oh, gunslinger is, it's a little bit like a fighter, but it's also a little bit like a, like a support role as well. Like, they do trick shots that basically set people up for being able to, being able to do, you know, get get people off guard and that kind of stuff.

So, like, they can they can do a lot of things that that kind of fall more on, like, a more on, like, a caster role, but they're not casters. And they still shoot they they still, like, you know, hit like a hit like a ton of bricks because they also Ranged. Yeah. Would Jason be ranged too? He'll be mid range is basically what the Kinesis is.

So it can be ranged, but it also can be melee. It's kind of like this. It's it's it's it's an interesting thing. Alright. So, Scott When do I get to pick some more weapons?

So before well, I'll leave it. Graduate. Okay. Yeah. No.

I'm and it's Hurgan is is your guy. Right? Yep. So I think that's how you'd say it. I just Googled some dwarf male ranger names.

That sounds awesome. Okay. So everything looks kosher. So the next piece is leveling. So you need to change your level from level one to level three.

Up top where that level shield is, you can just delete the number and put a three in there instead. Okay. So much. Now you have more feats. More feats to choose?

Yep. Keep in mind to choose. To choose. Yeah. Is there anything?

Oh, all the proficiencies just went up. Okay. Yeah. So you will get additional you will, you do get one additional skill proficiency at level two. So let me Can you go from trained to expert, or do you just go to trained?

Yeah. So no. At level two is when you get your skill feed, so you don't get a a skill increase. At level three is when you get skill increase, and that will go up to you can either boost a train to an expert or pick another skill and and make that entrained. Either one of those you can do.

Right now, we're just making one trained. Correct? No. So at level two, you get a skill fee. So you'll need to pick your skill fee first, because there are skill, skill limits.

So pick your skill fee. But then once you pick your skill feed, you can either increase one of your trained skills to expert or pick another skill and make that trained. Okay. So either way. The only reason why I'm make why I'm having you do the skill feat first is because skill feats have, you know, you need a skill at this level, you know, you add expert in order to be able to do this skill feed and that kind of stuff.

And at level two is when you get your skill feed. So So choose a level two skill feed first? Yep. Yep. Yes.

Am I good for the explosive savant dwarven ancestry feat? It is uncommon. Yes. Yeah. It's it's about, like, growing up being exposed to guns and explosives and things like that.

That sounds very fitting. Oh, man. Well, I thought so. Yep. Yeah.

About the only time that you might get me to push back on on, Ancestry feed is if there's a really powerful rare feed. But Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

But outside of Adam doesn't fit at all. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But, yeah, outside of Adam.

Yep. It's cool. It's cool. Okay. Well, I actually don't know.

We're just gonna go with the dagger. That makes sense more. And then, Oh, well, that seems pretty okay. That's wow. That's actually quite good.

It's a dwarf feat that at the end of your turn, you reduce frightened by two instead of one like normal. Right? That is really good. Oh. Weird.

There. Okay. Okay. Alright. Efficiencies check.

I am not sure which skill to choose, Chris. So many options. The skill feeds? Skill feats. Okay.

So with the skill feats, generally, what I have found useful, and and grant, I haven't played this game a lot. Mostly, I've ran it. But what I found useful is finding a skill that you want to do something cool with, and then only looking at the skill feats that are associated with that skill. So if you wanna focus on if you wanna focus on your athletics and, you know, getting something doing that, you can do that. Or or nature or survival, as a ranger, you know, survival is kind of one of your bread and butter skills.

So maybe you wanna take a look at survival skill feeds and see if there's something specific in there that speaks to you. Or, How do you filter them? So you do that by, going to pull up the dialogue so I can make sure I'm giving you an accurate thing here. Okay. So if you scroll down, on the left hand side, there's a skills section.

And if you just expand the skills section, you can pick a skill. Okay. Oh, hey. Jason's back. Hey.

I'm back. Sorry. So I'm yeah. You guys are doing your thing. You're amazing.

Yep. And so let's see. Where are we, Jason? You've got your skills. We're working on your feats.

Yeah. Okay. And same thing to you as what I said to Scott. Ancestry feats, you get two ancestry feats at level one because you are a dwarf paragon. So if there are two that you like, then don't feel like you have to choose between.

Okay. Let's say for those fees, choose a level one to simplify the list? Yeah. And, also, make sure that the trait dwarf is on there as well. Okay.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I see. Yep.

It's there. Doesn't you know, it's not really it's not giving me anything except level one, so that's not a big deal. Yep. Okay. So, Scott, looks like you've got a skill feat.

Have you chosen a proficiency that you want to make expert or train yourself in a new proficiency? I thought you said I couldn't do the Oh, you can now. Now that you pick the skill feat, you can do that. Okay. So I'm gonna become an expert in survival.

Okay. Perfect. And then, you know, going back to feats, now you just need to pick a class feat. More feats. Now, so here's here's the trick with these feats.

Most of the time, you're not gonna wanna go and look at lower level feats. Most of the time you're gonna want the the current level feat. But when you click on the class feats, it shows you the first level ones along with the second level ones. So really kind of a good way of being able to filter it is scrolling down to the levels section, and then just picking two out of two. And that'll show you only the second level feats that you can choose from, which should be a little bit easier.

Skills too? Right. Well, no. You can't sort them by skills, but also the class feats are including dedication feats. But since you already have the free archetype, you know, variation, you probably don't need to do the the dedication feeds.

So just exit the dedication feeds, and they'll drop you down to what you have in your ranger feeds, which is like 10 or less. So and in general, those class feats will lend themselves to a certain type of ranger, like there are certain class feats that are more that seem better for flurry rangers versus precision rangers and that kind of stuff. So, Okay. Some of those, you don't really have access to. Like, the monster warden, I think, is built on monster hunter, and you didn't pick monster hunter as your you took twin takedown instead, so that one is not available.

I do wanna redo this. Let's see here. Jason, if you wanna narrow down your, your class feats, to ones that you can actually use because, you know, obviously you can't do the earth air and that kind of stuff. In the trade section, if you type in metal, that should narrow things down. Yeah.

It's not doing it, though. I don't know. Yeah. It looks like there's a couple less maybe. I don't.

I took the dwarven. Dottiness. Mhmm. I was looking at that one. I thought that might be a good one for someone who's a thrill seeker.

Oh my gosh. Well, I think I know how to do it, but it's basically turning off it is basically looking, searching for each of the elements and then pressing the, clicking the no button to turn them off, and it's narrowing it down. Okay. So what you're looking at is elemental familiar, extended kinesis kinesis, flash forge, magnetic pinions, metal carapace, Shard Strike Okay. Burstal Blast I guess I weapon fusion.

Yeah. I'm not I'm not looking at those ones, I guess. Like, none of those are mine. Like, I'm not seeing any of those, I guess. Well, you specific to that other class.

Right? No. This these are the, you know, these are the kinetisys metal or Not the ancestry feats. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were looking at kinetics stuff.

My mistake. Not yet. I I was gonna do the two ancestry feats and That that makes sense. Oh, we did we did we did discover with those that if you, that the ancestry paragon, you need to go into the trade section and type in dwarf in there in order to be able to get only the dwarf feats. They don't filter it like they did in the original one.

K. So that should make it a little bit easier on you. Scott, did you take wilderness born? In what? Wilderness born.

And, ancestry feats or class feats? Ancestry. That might be in class as well for you. I took mountain strategy. Mhmm.

What did you say? Wilderness porn. I was just wondering if you took it. Not saying that you should. Honestly, didn't even click on it.

I really, I'm not sure that I'm catching the flavor of this Kineticis guy. Should should I so I guess part of what I'm I guess I'm partly thinking, like, with the metal thing a little bit like a magneto type fellow. Mhmm. Should I, in the the fantasy world, be is he going to be a ranged individual in combat? Is he going to be a a melee individual?

Yeah. He's gonna be more diplomatic. Like, I mean, the guy's a moron, so I don't think he's going to be very diplomatic. But Yeah. So as far as as far as, like, whether or not he's gonna be ranged or melee, that is yes.

Is the answer. Okay. You can do ranged. You can do melee. You won't be able to do extreme range, so you're more of a mid range to melee combatant.

So, like, you'll be able to, like, fling metal from, like, 30 feet away, that kind of thing. But you won't be able to, like, you know, be sixty, seventy, 80 feet away. And you can also and, like, when you're actually, like, in melee, you're you're able to do you know, you're able to, you know, hit with with the metal, with with the, metal element as well when you're in melee. So you're basically kinda effectively, you you're you're kind of a versatile character as far as, like, which range band you're you're supposed to be working with. Alright.

So okay. So that kinda, I guess, fits with some of what I was thinking there. I was yeah. I'm I'm on the edge with this guy of of leaning more roguish. Okay.

No way. And so I'm trying to break that out of my head. Oh, you don't wanna be? I don't know that I wanna run it like a rogue or I wanted to drop that old class and just go rogue, but, I'm I'm, so I'm trying to push myself in a different direction here. Does it does it make sense, to do, like, the dwarven weapon familiarity?

It Or You're you're primarily not going to be attacking with weapons. Although, I'm not sure if you if some of your powers work with them. Yeah. So you're, as any kind of kinet assist and, correct me where I'm wrong here, Chris, because I've not looked too deep into it. But your kind of primary attack is going to be a power that's just kinetic blast, and it's different for each element, what it looks like, and they have different properties.

But your kinetic blast can either be ranged, you know, like you throw metal at somebody or something, or they can be melee. And in the case where they're melee, they can get different bonuses. But in that case, it would be like, you know, almost like you, like, summon or create some kind of metal thing to whack them with, and then it, you know, vanishes or whatever. Yeah. Gotcha.

Exactly. So I mean, as far as like using weapons, unless there's some sort of kin unless there's some sort of kinetis power that specifically, like, empowers a weapon and makes it you're not really gonna be using them a whole lot. Okay. So I am largely gonna be running around unarmed. Yeah.

Well, it's like the, it's like the, the four, in three five, there was a and I think that there there's one in in fifth edition. There's a monk, an elemental monk that basically was able to channel elements and do a bunch of damage with with with the different elements and that kind of stuff. That's kind of the flavor of a Kineticist. It's like an elemental monk. So it's not the same as a monk because it doesn't have all like the, you know, run up walls things and that kind of stuff.

But, the flavor is more is more monk ish, which is probably why you're picking up that thief vibe because monks and thieves kind of have similar abilities. Okay. But it's not necessary that you be, you know, I I'm not trying to pigeonhole you into a monk, which is why I really haven't talked about it because it's, you know, you can be a you can play Knessis any kind of which way you want to. But like basically kind of the way that a lot of people think about like when Knessis are doing their thing and basically doing these elemental blasts and stuff. It's like they make they they perform certain hand gestures and kind of, like, do things that kind of create, create the the the the the the bending or the elemental mastery, if you will.

Although that's just flavor. Right? So if you wanna if you wanna do that if you wanna do the character like, like Magneto, where he just kinda thinks and things happen, that's perfectly that's perfectly allowed in the in the general flavor of of the kinetisist. Okay. And if you wanna know kind of what your what your attacks and things will look like, I did go ahead and use your channel elements and put it on your character.

So if you go over to your actions section there, you'll see an entry called Elemental Blast Metal. That's your that's your main attack. Chris, can I ask one quick question? Absolutely. What's that?

I don't see any level three ancestry paragon feats, just level ones. Is that Yeah. That's probably I think that you get ancestry feats typically at first and fourth, I wanna say. So you just get extra feats here. Yeah.

Your ancestry feed no. It's fifth fifth level. Okay. So Will you have a moment? Will you look my character over as I go get a drink and maybe a snack?

Sure. Skills, combat climber. Mhmm. How did that happen? When when did I choose that?

That was probably your background. Okay. Oh, okay. That's what the BG stands for. Okay.

Perfect. Yeah. No. Archetype feeds, general feeds, no bonus feed, last feed. Shouldn't have done the ancestry or the dwarf paragon.

That's just adding a bunch of hullabaloo in here. It's pretty it's cool, though. Like, the racial feats are neat. Yeah. They are.

They're cool, and they're flavorful, and it's just it is Uh-huh. Alright. So, looking at the class feed there, how did we go about getting rid of all of the additional ancillary? Okay. So I I actually threw up a, a screenshot of what I did in, in Discord.

But basically, I searched for earth, air, fire, water, and wood. I added those into the trait section. And then there's like a little no smoke a little no smoking sign on there. If you click on that, it removes it says everything that isn't this. And that'll leave you with the one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

Seven feats that you do actually have access to. Oh, did you do that in the trade section? Mhmm. Yep. Okay.

Earth, air. What was the other one? Earth, air, fire Earth, air, fire, water, and wood. Pathfinder for, whatever reason decided that they wanted to follow the eastern concept of of elements. So that's where metal and wood came into play.

Mhmm. Yeah. And did you do the little no smoking side and get everything taken care of? Yes. Cool.

Yeah. That's true. That was Cool. Cool. Cool.

I tried for whatever reason, when I tried that in the trades last time, I must've been doing something wrong because it wasn't pulling those up. Yeah. No. And, like, I I tried to just search for the ones that had metal in there, but it didn't do it. But, apparently, it was looking for a blacklist, not white not a white list.

Hi, Scott. Everything looked good on my end. Like, I think you got everything taken care of here. Now all that we need to worry about is equipment. And as I yeah.

Equipment. And as I as I said in Discord, since they're starting at level three, they actually have a level three equipment guide. They've got a level by level equipment guide here. So, basically, what this is is a second level, or it is a level three, guide. You're able to get one second level permanent item and two first level permanent items.

So how do you do that? Alright. I'm anticipating that question. Basically How do you do that? Oh, wow.

It's a good question, Scott. Let me tell you. If you go into your inventory section and you click on the, the magnifying glass that's next to any one of the item categories. I'm just gonna do weapons and shields. So if you click on that, it will pop up the compendium browser.

Inside the compendium browser, you'll want to deselect the shield and weapon on there. Then in the traits, you want to type in consumable. And then cons and then click on the little no smoking sign on the consumable trait. And that'll take away everything that is a consumable, so everything that's left is permanent items. Then, in the levels section, you will want to in the level section on the left hand side at the bottom, you'll want to pick level two to level two.

And that is all of the permanent items that are level two that you have access to. Now if you're looking for a specific sort of permanent item, say a weapon or a shield or armor or equipment, or something like that, you can go through the inventory types and and pick that, and that will give you an idea of what's available at level two. However, Does it matter how much it costs? No. Our rooms for weapons and armor are taken care of, right, with the whatever whatever?

Yeah. Yep. Automatic. Got it. Duck.

Yeah. The automatic rune progression. Yeah. Mhmm. Mhmm.

Mhmm. Okay. Base runes are taken care of for that. And you said level two to three? No.

It's level two to two. So you get one level two item and then you get two level one items. So you're gonna wanna do the same thing with level ones. And then after that, you get 25 gold that you can spend any way you want. So you can pick up additional weapons, equipment, things, as long as it's not any as long as the level is three or lower, you can spend any of that 25 gold on whatever you want.

Do we already have armor? You do not. So you'll have to figure out your armor situation. And for you, Scott, you see proficiencies. As a ranger, you have access to light armor and medium armor.

So those are those are you're not gonna be able to get heavy armor. But Okay. Alright. Jason, what's cool? Like that versatile blast, the weapon infusion.

They both seem, like, pretty neat. They dropped one in, but it's not showing up. Oh, there it is. No. That's not it.

Oh, it did. It went into bonus feats. It didn't Yeah. I'll just move it up. Yeah.

I'll move it up to class feats. There you go. Burstal blast. I don't get a bonus feat. Right?

No. No. Because they show that I have okay. So I think we're done with feats. Yay.

Okay. Excellent. So you're you you thought you were done with feats. You're not done with feats. So now you're leveling your character.

So you'll want to take that level one in the shield in the upper right hand corner and change that to a level three. Alright. Now there's a very specific order in which I want you to be, in which I want you to be doing things. I want you to pick a new skill feat at level two. So find this find another skill feat that that you want.

Then after that, change your upgrade one of your proficiencies from trained to expert, or pick another proficiency and change that to trained, and then do the rest of your feeds. K. Skilled feeds. Is there anything I should be doing to limit the 1,400 of these that are available? Absolutely, there is.

I will give you the same advice that I gave that I gave Scott. My advice is go to your proficiency section, find a skill that you wanna be able to do something cool for. And once you've chosen that skill, then in the skill feed section in the skill feed compendium browser, on the left hand side, there's a skills section that you can expand and just pick that skill. And look at the skill feeds in there, see if one speaks to you. And then if you don't like any of those, just pick another skill and keep going.

Advice, Chris? Yep. Would you use your level two on armor or a weapon? I did take a look at the level two weapons. There isn't really anything except for hand wraps as heavy blows.

So I would use my level two on armor. And armor can be, you said, medium. Right. Like that. Fashionably or something like that.

Yeah. Let's see here. There's a gray maiden play, but that sounds more like a woman's armor. K. So bastion plate is heavy armor.

Fortress plate is probably heavy armor as well. Yeah. Where do you see the difference? Okay. So size when it says size, that's a medium.

Yeah. So, basically, what you're wanting to do is you're wanting to click on one. So, like, say, I click the gray maiden plate in the, at that point it pops up a little dialog. There's a details tab. In the details tab, it'll tell you whether what category of armor it's in.

Anything that's labeled plate is probably going to be heavy armor. And I can't have heavy armor, you said. Right? Right. Looks like all of these are heavy armor.

Well? Yeah. So I I don't think they're they're magic. It's just the the highest level of base heavy armor is not available at character creation, which is why it's a higher level, I think. Right.

Okay. Well, you could use your so, Scott, you are you're a dual wielding ranger. You wouldn't be able to do this for both of your weapons, but, you could get a fanged rune, which is a level two, item. That would that would put that would be a rune on your weapon. And that has in the when it's activated, you transform into a small or medium an animal that wields the fanged weapon in its jaws.

The animal matches matches the animal that you most closely associate with, or a wolf. If a specific animal is a okay. And it's maybe maybe you don't wanna turn to an animal. But that's like the only level two rune in here. Let me see if I can find something else.

But we don't get any level three stuff even though we're level three. Right? Right. It's level one level two and two level ones. Okay.

Right. And those things are the the price, it you can it's any price, any any any gold. So if you've got, like, a really expensive thing that you wanna get and it's level two, spend your level two thing on that. Post. Yep.

Factory. Sick. Well, So, Scott, this one might be something that your character might be interested in. It's Jack's tattered cape. I'm gonna post it in the channel here.

Or not in the not in the channel, but in, on the page. Now it's a rare item, but Leap, high jump, or long jump, you gain a plus one item bonus. Yeah. So it's kinda weird. If you leap high jump or long jump, you gain a plus one bonus to stealth checks until the start of your next turn.

So, Chris, I'm wanting to do dual wielding. So, like, this ax musket needs two hands. I wouldn't wanna do that? Probably not. You're probably looking at, as far as dual wielding is concerned, you'd probably wanna do either two warhammers or two, or two, battle axes.

If you're wanting to go in, you know, just lean into the dwarf style, that that that be what you That's what I was trying to find, but I just don't see them. I don't think that they're level like, they might not be level one. Right? Or they might not be level two. They might be, like, zero level items.

Okay. That might be it might be thing there. Okay. But that means they don't hit as hard? No.

It it means that it mean, like, I mean, really at level three, you're not gonna be running around with a bunch of, like, magic weapons and that kind of stuff. So, as you gain as you go up in level, you're going to be you're going to get access to additional things. But, really the main thing that you care about with the weapons are your are are your, base level runes, like your plus one and your, striking runes, and those are those are what make your weapon more potent. And those are automatically being added to your weapon, so, you should be good with those. This is kind of fun.

I'm not sure how your character would feel about it being a ranger and everything, but there's this alchemist flamethrower. What it does is you load it with alchemist fire, and then you basically and you shoot it, so it gives you a little bit of a range thing. And when you do, whoever you aim it at, takes, in a 30 foot line or 60 foot line, has to make a basic reflex save, or take one d eight fire damage. Or no, they take one d eight fire damage, or, you know, half, and they have one persistent fire damage on top of that. For a lesser alchemist fire, then you should get more.

They bigger alchemist fires, they do bigger damage. But Dumb question. I mean, I was just thinking of getting, like, a sword and, like, either a hammer or an axe and then some armor. Okay. The level one, level two, and level zero are still throwing me off.

Okay. So, really, when it comes here when it come like, the the armor let me see what we've got at level one armor. So level arm level one armor, you've got you've got more stuff to work with. Cirque carapace is a medium armor. Give you a plus four item bonus.

That's a level one. Yeah. I like that one. Yeah. So, I mean, that's one of your level one ones right there is getting getting armor, getting that armor.

And the the rest of this stuff is just more along lines of, like, the the level two and the level one things are basically, like, as you have gone through your, time together, Or as you've leveled up, you've acquired higher level items. So that this is giving you that opportunity to have a higher level item. That's that's really all there is to it. So I'm not hurting myself by choosing level zero weapons? No.

No. Not even remotely close. The level the level two the level one, the level two items, these are supposed to be, like, magic items that you picked up in your adventures. They're not supposed to necessarily be weapons or armor. They can, but they don't need to be, especially at level three.

I mean, if you were level 10 and you were picking up level zero items for for weapons, maybe we'd be having to talk. But And really guys, don't spend a ton of time stressing about what you're picking. This is just flavor stuff. As long as you got two weapons in your hands and some armor, they're in good shape. Don't feel like you have don't feel like you're making the wrong decision.

One don't feel like you're making the wrong you have to make the right decision or you're gonna be you're gonna be terrible. That's not gonna happen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

I've made so many terrible decisions tonight. I don't know what to do. It's gonna be fine. Orin It's got all kinds of deals. You're gonna be just fine.

Two two two two two two. Hands. Hands. How are you doing, Jason? I'm gonna play that.

Not seeing much for the skill feed somewhere. Oh, this is great. They're they're not gonna be done. They're like, I mean, these aren't gonna be great things. So and they're not going to make your character more powerful.

Just straight up skill feats don't make your character more powerful. They just bring versatility in there. So if you're looking at skill feat and expecting to get expecting to get some sort of stat boost to make you better at doing stuff, it's it's it's it's not gonna they're mostly, like, role play related things. Mhmm. So alright.

So skill sheet, I picked one, then I move on to what? Then you need to increase one of your skills to expert or pick a new skill and make it trained. That's a tough one. Okay. Interesting.

Okay. Okay. On there? Moving on? Back to feeds, I'm assuming?

Yes. Back to feats. And then just go through and find more feats. Preferably level two feats for anything that's level two. Level three feats for anything that's level three, except for that Ancestry Paragon feat, which will only be another level one dwarf feat.

So so if you there was one dwarf feat that you left behind that you're like, man, would have liked that one. There's your opportunity. Oh, alright. So I'm in the class feat looking at so I need to go back through and add all of that wind. Right.

Why does it not in the trace? Let me do that. Oh, I would also remove the dedication feed as well. Turn that one off. Okay.

K. Air would first It may have selected things. Okay. What am I missing? I don't know.

Mhmm. K. So you've got your dwarven war axe, your war hammer, your hard shell. K. Did you purchase those?

Or I just dragged them because it wouldn't let me buy them. Okay. Well, that's because you don't have any money, but you do have money. So 3 gold, one gold. So you have 4 gold minus the 25 gold to spend.

So you have 21 gold left. Yeah. And then, Scott, like, I would just go through any of the start going through the equipment and seeing if he can find something at that's level two equipment, that that you think would be fun. And same thing with, like, a level one equipment, because you still need one level one equipment too. And I have to buy it?

Those equipments, you don't have to buy. Anything else that you anything else that you buy anything else that you have, you do need to buy. But I've given you 21 gold. Speaking of, Ramsey's dwarf is going to get 25 gold. So he so when he gets around to it, he can do his thing.

But you don't have to spend all 25 of that gold either. I would get a backpack or a or a traveler's pack or something like that, as well, just for rations and things. Oh, shit. Nope. Why can't we do it there, can't I?

Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. No.

No. No. No. I can do that. I, I do not find any real value in either of the level two kinetisys beats.

You wanna pick a level one feat that you missed? Because you can pick a level one feat. I'm wondering if if I'm just not understanding the two options. Or Oh, let me take a look. Points.

I mean, you could always pick up metal carapace, which would give you armor. Yeah. And that's level one. That one. Yeah.

We Kinetic activation. I'm just struggling to imagine an occasion in which that I that I would actually use. Well, and that's my problem with voice elements too. It's like, when when am I gonna talk to an elemental that just doesn't seem like it's a frequent occurrence, unless this is an interplanar world. Well, it is.

And we just have never explored it. So then maybe you would end up in a position where there are elementals running around. But, yeah. So I don't know. I just struggle to see how that one would be a thing you would employ.

And the same with the kinetic activation. I don't know that there's too many metal spells. Haven't seen any. Am I wrong in my assessment of those two? There are actually lots of metal spells out there.

Oh, really? Yeah. You just haven't seen them. Okay. We'll run with it because I would assume that this character might actually have seen those and know what those are.

So it's affected Jason does not. So done. I'll do that. Okay. Archetype c.

What's the archetype c? The archetype feet is, the that's the dedication. So, that's like, it can be, like, it's effectively a multi classing fee. Right? So there are a number of different dedication feats out there.

You can basically, basically just kinda go through there and find something that you think you're you would like your character to be secondarily good at. Again, like, these are more flavor things. Yeah. They add a little bit of they add a little bit of thing a little bit of crunch to your character, but, I definitely would rather you go through and just be like, you know, go through and find something that you're like, this sounds like this sounds cool and pick it, then basically just trying to agonize over what is the right decision because there is no right decision. Mhmm.

So Just like there is, don't backpack. What's what about adventurer's pack? But does it say backpack in the name? Adventure. Back.

Beck. Alright. Do you want it? Lot of the low level items are just really cool. Yeah.

I mean, they're a lot of them aren't, like, super powerful, but they're just fun. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep.

Okay. I need to change that. Alright. Deployable cover. What's this thing called?

There's things that have pictures that look like backpacks or satchels, but they're not. Yeah. I'm kinda thinking more along lines of, like, there's there's let me I can't I can't look it up. They're, like, with your characters when you first got them or when you first first made them, like, you all started off with, like, a adventurers pack where, it contains like a bed roll and a torch and, you know, that sort of stuff in there. I'm trying to remember what it's called.

K. Yeah. It's a new ventures pack. Okay. Focus on.

There's a sturdy satchel. That's a level two. 100. It's the only thing I can find. It's 30 gold pieces.

Orbs have some kind of vision. Right? Yeah. They've got dark vision. Yeah.

Okay. So can I get this sturdy satchel even though it's a level two of 30 gold pieces? Well, you haven't gotten a, a level two item yet anyway, so you probably could. That's the only thing that came up under container. Oh, here here it is.

Okay. So what you wanna do is go to the container section and click on the magnifying glass there. And you'll see a bunch of different ones. Some of them are level one. Container.

You have the sturdy satchel in there for sure, but there's also a sack and oil skin pouch, a horn of plenty, chest, chair, a chair for storage, a backpack. I don't know why I can't find this adventurous pack, though, so equipment. Alright. Oh, no. It's not that.

Yes. I need to buy that. Collect at least one token. Yeah. Keep getting that error too.

Okay. That's fine. We'll just do it the the hard way. No big deal. Alright.

So 10 minus 2 golds. Armor. What kind of armor? Needs it to be. Corey BDM or light, I suppose.

K. Okay. Okay. It's whatever. Alright.

I'll just go with leather then. Instead of leather, it gives you one more. One more? Armor. Yeah.

It has a lower dex cap, though. I've got four dex. I think so. Yeah. Yeah.

We got four decks, so I don't need What's that bother? I didn't but I think I could be wrong. Wouldn't be the first time. Yeah. Yeah.

It takes capital three. Yeah. Correct. Which, you know, it would be the same, but Yep. But why not maximize your your decks?

You spent so much on it. Right. Right. Right. Two gold down.

Alright. What else do we need? Oh, I probably need how does that work? I need bullets. Yeah.

You do need ammunition. I definitely need bullets. Oh, more bullets. They're not called bullets. What the heck are they called?

Yep. Jason, how are you doing with the with the, archetype feed? I've, decided not to be an assassin. Excellent. That narrows it down quite a bit.

I was liking the dual list Okay. Or the or the monk. K. You could do that. I see.

I see. You could go monk. I thought the monk, was interesting. Where did I yeah. I thought the monk was but there was a dual, a dual there was a dual that says, like, hey.

Like, just let's fight. Yep. So a little bit of disguise. I thought there was a dual weapon also, and I thought that could be a fun one. Oh, yeah.

Okay. With this guy as well, like, I could I could see that being fun. I don't know how I guess, I don't know how that would work. Because he's he's largely just going to be, like I guess, I I'm envisioning, like, potentially, for lack of better terminology, willing, like, iron gauntlets and just, like, doing a double punch, or all of a sudden, two two hammers show up, and he just, like, brings them across, you know, double double hit to the to the head or something of that nature. I could see that being kind of a fun way to run it.

If that's It's it's totally that's totally doable. I do think that you would need to switch around your attributes in order to be able to do that, though. Okay. Yeah. Because I don't have strength.

You have zero strength. Yes. Do so, like, hammer would be bludgeoning. That's obviously a strength. Is everything that's melee strength?

Not everything. I think that there are some finesse weapons that are agility, but those are like daggers and Dagger. Rapier. Yeah. Those things.

So if you're looking to smash something k. Then that's, you know, then then you're looking at strength. So I have a slot charisma. Yeah. Everybody does.

Welcome to Orbs are not known for their charismatic tactics. Yeah. So, Scott, while we're while we're waiting for other folks to kinda get caught up. There we go. Get going here.

I do have some, like, background, like, character questions that I wanna float out. Just kinda hoping to do that. Well, no. It's I don't got time for that. I just have to pick it up.

You got time for that, Chris? No. I don't got time for that. We'll we'll just have to pick it up next time. I didn't do it.

No. That's fine. Speaking of Next Time, it did occur to me that on our regular on our regularly scheduled meeting, that is the week that's the mon or that's the Tuesday after Friday's weekend. Mhmm. And I have a different game scheduled on that Monday as well.

And so that would equal to weekend away from away from my family. By two nights of gaming. Oh, by two nights of gaming. So I was curious if we had some flexibility to maybe shift for a week to the what would that be? To, like, the nineteenth instead of the twelfth, but I wasn't sure if people would be amenable to that.

I don't know what your, ICIT schedule looks like. I'm doing those Sunday nights. Okay. Yep. So that'll be ICIT.

The nineteenth, is that Wednesday? That's Tuesday. So it's the same day. It's just shifted by a week. I think I think Tuesday would be fine for me that week.

Okay. Yeah. The nineteenth. And That works for me. Okay.

Cool. Scott, would you be able to make that work too? I think so. It's my anniversary, so I don't know. What?

No. No. What? What you're saying? Dude, no.

I think so. No. I do not think so. No. Okay.

I don't think it matters. I do. Will Julie think it matters? We're not so big on all that. On the specific day, you just Okay.

Do stuff when you can do stuff. Yeah. Okay. That's fair. Well, if if if it really is okay, then you know, because, I mean, really, the reason why I'm asking for a shift is because I wanna, you know, I I I want to make sure that I get wife time.

So I don't wanna take your wife time away during your anniversary because that seems pretty lame Yeah. For my things. So Tuesday. I never do anything on a Tuesday. Fair enough.

I can ask. Throw it out there and Okay. But I thought you said Tuesdays weren't the best day for you because of being out of town or something. Or is that Well, they they are they are less of a good day for me now. But, you know, it seemed like it seemed like Tuesdays were still, like, the group's preferred day regardless.

So I was so I'm just Okay. What day it is? Yeah. Okay. Well, I mean, that and that is and that is a question as well.

Like, you know, is Tuesday still the day? I think it was more of a Clark schedule thing. Is that he he because he's got a really busy schedule, but I don't know. Doesn't make a difference to me. Okay.

Jason, you've got ICIT on Sunday. Are there any other days that are specifically not good for you? Not that I know of at this point. Okay. Yeah.

Are there any days that are specifically better for you? I well, between now and and the start of school, no. Okay. Once school starts, then things will will shift and change. Allison will stop working at her her thing so that part of our schedule will change.

I I so until until I get to the school and actually see what school is gonna look like and be like this year, I don't I don't know. And the only reason I say that is because I am I am shifting from being at Grayling High School to being down in Roscommon and Grayling High School. I just don't know Okay. Don't know if there's gonna be different expectations in different places, what that would look like. So that's Oh, yeah.

Definitely not a big deal. We'll we'll we'll just we'll just deal with what's happening before school starts, and then afterwards, we'll just kinda shift and try and try and make it work as best we can. Okay. So maybe so let's let let me let me come back around, look at my look at my schedule and that kind of thing and see if I can find see if I can find a different proposed day. And if and if that works for everybody, then maybe we'll just kinda shift it to that instead.

So I I did want to, did wanna ask before before, you know, we before we call it. Oh, and also, I know that people are still actively working on your characters. Before the next time we meet, like, let's let's try and get everything taken care of if that means that I need to take some time aside with with somebody to, you know, with you Jason to kinda help finish things off with you, I'm more than happy to do that. I will leave the, I will leave the game table on as much as possible as well so that you can so that you can just log in and work on your character if you need to. Same thing with you, Ramsey.

I know that you're, like, mid character as well. If there's a specific time where you're, like, I really wanna work on my character, and you try and log on and my computer is not up or anything, just send me a text. As long as it's not during as long as it's not during the workday and I'm not at home, then, I'll I'll turn it I'll turn it on. But I generally will try and turn off my computer, at night because we found that it helps us sleep better when we don't have electronics going on in the next room. So, but we'll we'll get that worked out.

## 🛡️ **Session 0 Introduction – The Cracked Granite**

When the [[Flaming Retribution]] scorched the surface world, the [[Dwarves]] did not burn. They sealed their gates, reinforced their halls, and endured. For a year, [[Ironhold]] remained silent—its people surviving by stone, steel, and stubborn will.

Now, the gates have opened.

[[Ironhold]] is a kingdom of clans. Each clan has its own traditions, its own strengths—miners, warriors, scholars, traders, mystics, scouts. Some dwarves are born into these clans. Others walk alone, clanless but not without purpose.

[[King Hargrin Deepmantle]], believes the time has come to reclaim the surface. He has sent out colonies—small footholds in the wilds—to reestablish dwarven presence in the world. Not all agree.

Two factions now shape [[Ironhold]]’s future:

- **Isolationists** believe the surface is still cursed, and that [[Ironhold]] must remain sealed and self-sufficient.
- **Expansionists** believe the world is ripe for reclamation, and that [[Dwarves]] must rise again as builders and rulers.

Tensions simmer. Old grudges stir. And the fate of [[Ironhold]] may rest in the hands of those willing to walk beyond the granite walls.

You are [[Dwarves]] of renown—adventurers, soldiers, champions. You are not bound by politics, but you are trusted to act with strength, wisdom, and honor.

Before you choose your path, ask yourself:

- What clan do you hail from—or do you walk alone?
- What do you believe Ironhold should become?

The stone endures. But even stone can crack.

# Beginning Adventure
### 🎙️ **Session 1 Introduction – The King’s Call**

> _The halls of Ironhold are never truly silent. Even in the deepest chambers, the stone remembers footsteps, whispers, and war._

You are summoned to a sealed chamber beneath the throne room—one rarely used, and never without purpose. The guards at the door do not speak. The torches here burn low, casting long shadows across rune-carved walls.

You are heroes of [[Ironhold]]—your names spoken with respect in the forges, the barracks, and the ale halls. You’ve earned that honor through your deeds.

[[King Hargrin Deepmantle]] has called you here in secret, away from the eyes and ears of the council, for a purpose that will be revealed once your arrive.

You find yourself in the room with [[King Hargrin Deepmantle|King Hargrin]] and 4 of his trusted advisors 
- [[Baelgrin Deepdelve]] (the High Loremaster)
- [[Bramli Stoneguard]] (Captain of the Royal Guard)
- [[Kelda Deepshiver]] (Spy Master)
- [[Marnak Deepforge]] (Guild master of the [[Ironhold]] Miners' Consortium)

## 🛡️ **The Dwarves of Aetheria: A Primer for Players**

### 🏔️ **Who Are the Dwarves of Ironhold?**

The dwarves of Ironhold are a proud, resilient people who survived the cataclysmic **Flaming Retribution** by sealing themselves deep within their mountain strongholds. While the surface world burned, they endured—by stone, steel, and stubborn will.

Now, one year later, the gates have opened.

Ironhold is a kingdom of clans. Each clan has its own traditions, strengths, and responsibilities—miners, warriors, scholars, traders, mystics, scouts. Some dwarves are born into these clans. Others walk alone, clanless but not without purpose.

---

### ⚔️ **The Giant Wars**

Centuries ago, the dwarves of Ironhold fought a brutal war against the giant tribes of the north. These towering enemies were powerful, cruel, and aligned with dark gods. The war was long and devastating, but the dwarves prevailed—driving the giants to the brink of extinction.

Today, the giants are remembered as a threat that was **wiped from the face of Aetheria**, never to rise again. Their ruins remain, but their power is believed to be broken.

---

### 🏛️ **Politics of Ironhold**

Ironhold is ruled by **King Hargrin Deepmantle**, a monarch who survived the Flaming Retribution and now seeks to rebuild the dwarven legacy. His vision is bold: to reclaim the surface and reestablish dwarven colonies across the land.

Not all dwarves agree.

Two major factions shape Ironhold’s future:

- **Isolationists** believe Ironhold should remain sealed and self-sufficient. They fear the surface is still cursed and that expansion invites ruin.
- **Expansionists** support the king’s efforts to reclaim lost lands and restore dwarven influence. They see opportunity in rebuilding and reconnecting with the world.

These factions exist across clans, families, and guilds. Some clans lean heavily toward one side, while others are divided within.

---

### 🧭 **Clans of Ironhold**

Clans are tight-knit, proud, and influential. They shape dwarven identity and politics.

🪓 **Clanless dwarves** are rare but not unheard of. They may be orphans, exiles, or those who rejected their clan’s politics. Some see them as dangerous. Others see them as free. A clanless dwarf may be mistrusted by traditionalists but respected for their independence.

---

- A decorated soldier from the border wars
- A scout who braved the surface before the gates reopened
- A relic hunter who unearthed secrets best left buried
- A mercenary who earned a name in the underworld
- A loyal agent of the crown—or a former one

I am creating a new adventure that will span from level 3-5. The characters are all dwarves that live in the north western mountains. this takes place in the 4th age, about a year after the Flaming Retribution. The dwarves survived the Flaming Retribution in their strongholds build into the mountains themselves. About 6 months after the destruction. They decided to open their doors to see what the world looked like and to start colonizing and repopulating their realm. One such colony was established in the north and the Kingdom hasn't heard from them for months. The Dwarf king has called for brave souls to go to the colony and see what has become of it. The characters have answered the call. What do you need to know to help put together the bones of this adventure?

This sounds like a rich and compelling setup! To help you build the bones of the adventure, here are the key areas I’d need more detail on. You can answer as many or as few as you like, and I’ll tailor the structure accordingly:

---

### 🧱 **World & Setting Details**

1. **What is the name of the Dwarven Kingdom and the lost colony?**
2. **What is the terrain like between the stronghold and the colony?** (e.g., tundra, forest, ruins, mountains)
3. **Are there known threats in the region?** (e.g., goblins, undead, corrupted wildlife, remnants of the Flaming Retribution)

---

### 🧙‍♂️ **Tone & Themes**

4. **What tone are you aiming for?** (e.g., mystery, horror, survival, exploration, political intrigue)
5. **Do you want the adventure to be mostly linear, sandbox, or a mix?**

---

### 🛡️ **Gameplay Elements**

6. **Do you want dungeon crawls, wilderness survival, social encounters, or a mix?**
7. **Any specific types of challenges or puzzles you want included?**
8. **Do you want to include divine or magical elements tied to the Flaming Retribution or the Llano?**

---

### 📜 **Narrative Hooks**

9. **What kind of secrets or twists might be hidden in the colony?** (e.g., betrayal, ancient relics, forbidden magic, cult activity)
10. **Is there a timeline or urgency to the mission?** (e.g., a storm is coming, a festival deadline, a rival party is also investigating)

---

Once I have some of these answers, I can help you build:

- A **three-act structure** or modular adventure flow
- **Key NPCs** and factions
- **Encounter ideas** and maps
- **Lore tie-ins** to the Flaming Retribution, La Pelu, or ancient relics

Would you like to start with the colony’s name and what the dwarves expected to find there?

##### You said:

1. Kingdom: Ironhold, Colony: Dagger's Sheath2. Mountains and Foothills3. No known threats other than wildlife (There are Giant's but the Dwarves are not aware of them. The dwarves think that they destroyed the Giants in a war years and years ago, but the giants have been biding their time and waiting for an opportunity to strike. The Flaming Retribution gave them their opportunity)4. Looking for an Exploration kind of feel with a little bit of Political Intrigue mixed in5. Mostly Linear as I am looking to get it resolved with in 4-6 sessions6. a mix7. nothing specific8. Not necessarily. It would be good to have some background around the Flaming Retribution, but other than being the impetus for the adventure and the enemies, I don't feel the need to keep it in the foreground. So... yes, but no.9. I am open to suggestions, but I am thinking that this is going to be a colony that was established and then destroyed by the Giant Tribes, as a first strike into the Dwarven lands. They are hoping to use this as a staging ground for their assaults, but would love to get some additional complimentary ideas.10. I am open to their being a timeline, but don't feel a definitive need.

Perfect! Based on your vision, here’s a **structured adventure framework** for your 4–6 session campaign, with room for flexibility and expansion:

---

## 🛠️ **Adventure Title**: _Echoes in Dagger’s Sheath_

### 🎯 **Adventure Summary**

The dwarves of Ironhold, having survived the Flaming Retribution, begin reclaiming their ancestral lands. One such effort—**Dagger’s Sheath**, a northern colony—has gone silent. The king calls for brave dwarves to investigate. What they find is the first strike of a long-dormant enemy: the **Giants**, once thought extinct, now rising from the shadows.

---

## 📚 **Adventure Structure**

### **Session 1: The King’s Call**

- **Location**: Ironhold Stronghold
- **Key Scenes**:
    - Royal summons and briefing by the Dwarven King or his steward.
    - Political tension: some nobles argue the colony was a mistake; others suspect sabotage.
    - Supply gathering, farewells, and rumors (e.g., “the mountains whisper again”).
- **Optional Hook**: A rival expedition is also being considered—could be a future ally or antagonist.

---

### **Session 2: Into the Foothills**

- **Location**: Mountain passes and ancient roads
- **Encounters**:
    - Wildlife (e.g., territorial cave bears, corrupted mountain goats).
    - Environmental hazards: rockslides, unstable bridges, remnants of the Flaming Retribution.
    - Optional: a ruined outpost with signs of a **giant-sized footprint**.
- **Clue**: A survivor’s journal or a broken dwarven automaton with a partial message.

---

### **Session 3: The Silent Colony**

- **Location**: Dagger’s Sheath (now partially ruined)
- **Exploration**:
    - Abandoned buildings, signs of battle, and eerie silence.
    - Evidence of **giant weapons**, crushed stonework, and missing bodies.
    - A hidden chamber with a dwarven scout’s final message.
- **Twist**: A **giant scouting party** returns while the players are investigating.

---

### **Session 4: The Enemy Revealed**

- **Location**: Nearby cave system or ruined temple used by the giants
- **Encounters**:
    - Giant warbands (hill giants, ogres, or corrupted trolls).
    - Captured dwarves or slaves from other races.
    - A **giant shaman** communing with a relic from the Second Age.
- **Lore Drop**: The giants believe the Flaming Retribution was a sign from their gods to reclaim the surface.

---

### **Session 5: The Decision**

- **Location**: Dagger’s Sheath or a defensible mountain pass
- **Choices**:
    - Fortify and hold the colony until reinforcements arrive?
    - Sabotage the giants’ supply lines and retreat?
    - Attempt diplomacy with a splinter faction of giants?
- **Climax**: A siege, escape, or final duel with a giant war leader.

---

### **Session 6 (Optional): Return and Reckoning**

- **Location**: Ironhold
- **Resolution**:
    - Political fallout: some dwarves want war, others fear provoking more attacks.
    - The party’s report shapes the kingdom’s next move.
    - Seeds for future adventures: ancient relics, giant alliances, or a deeper threat.

---

## 🧩 **Optional Additions**

- **Political Intrigue**: A noble may have sabotaged the colony’s defenses to discredit a rival.
- **Ancient Relic**: A fragment of the Llano or a dwarven artifact tied to the Veilcant Guard.
- **Environmental Mystery**: The Flaming Retribution altered the ley lines—strange magic lingers.

---

Would you like me to help you flesh out:

- Encounter stat blocks?
- NPCs (like the king, rival noble, or giant shaman)?
- A printable player handout or map of Dagger’s Sheath?

Let’s build it out however you like!

##### You said:

I would like to start the actual campaign with the group in The Dagger's Sheath, and with a war band attacking them. I would prefer the war band to be subordinates to the giants, but not giants themselves. I do like the idea of a corrupted official who has made a deal with the giants to help them in exchange for the Crown of the dwarven kingdom, with a dark faction in his wake. I want the team to end up fighting the Giants or a Giant Boss as well as deposing the corrupted official and revealing the dark organization. can you make those updates?

Excellent updates! Here's how we can revise and expand the adventure structure to reflect your new direction:

## 🛠️ **Adventure Title**: _Echoes in Dagger’s Sheath_

### 🎯 **Updated Summary**

The dwarves of Ironhold have begun reclaiming their realm after the Flaming Retribution. But when the colony of **Dagger’s Sheath** goes silent, a team of brave dwarves is sent to investigate. They arrive to find the colony under siege by monstrous forces—**not giants**, but their **subordinate war bands**. As the party fights to survive, they uncover a deeper betrayal: a **corrupted dwarven official** has allied with the giants, seeking the crown for himself. Behind him lies a **dark faction** whose ambitions threaten the very heart of Ironhold.

---

## 🧱 **Revised Adventure Structure (4–6 Sessions)**

### **Session 1: Fire at the Gate**

- **Start in Media Res**: The party arrives at Dagger’s Sheath as it is under attack by a war band.
- **Enemies**: Giant-aligned creatures (e.g., ogres, corrupted orcs, enslaved goblins, or elemental brutes).
- **Objective**: Survive the assault, secure a defensible location, and rescue any survivors.
- **Clue**: A dying dwarf whispers, “They came from the mountains… but they weren’t alone.”

---

    - Giant-sized tracks and siege tools.
    - A hidden journal from the colony’s leader detailing strange negotiations with a “dwarven emissary.”

    - Warband remnants, traps, and corrupted wildlife.
    - A **dark ritual site** with symbols tied to a forbidden dwarven sect.
- **Reveal**: The warband is led by a **giant lieutenant** who mentions “the pact with the Ironblood.”

---

### **Session 4: The Traitor’s Shadow**

- **Location**: Return to Ironhold or a hidden stronghold of the traitor.
- **Political Intrigue**:
    - The traitor (e.g., **Thrain Ironblood**, a noble with a claim to the throne) is gaining influence.
    - He denies involvement, but evidence mounts.
- **Optional Twist**: A member of the king’s council is secretly part of the dark faction.

---

### **Session 5: The Giant’s Gambit**

- **Location**: A sacred dwarven site now occupied by the giants.
- **Climax**: Battle against a **giant warlord** or corrupted elemental champion.
- **Objective**: Stop the giants from activating an ancient dwarven forge or weapon.

Got it! Here's the updated **Session 1** outline reflecting your new intro:

---

## 🧱 **Session 1: Ashes of Dagger’s Sheath**

### 🎬 **Opening Scene**

- The party arrives at **Dagger’s Sheath** to find it **completely demolished**—buildings shattered, stonework scorched, and no signs of life.
- The air is thick with ash and silence. The only sounds are the wind and the creak of broken timber.

### 🔍 **Exploration Phase**

- Players investigate the ruins:
    - **Clues**: Giant-sized footprints, shattered weapons, and signs of a brutal siege.
    - **Mystery**: No bodies—only blood trails and drag marks leading into the mountains.
    - **Tension**: Subtle signs of being watched (e.g., disturbed rocks, distant howls).

### ⚔️ **Combat Encounter: Warband Ambush**

- As the party uncovers a half-buried dwarven standard or a sealed message tube, they are **ambushed** by a **giant-aligned warband**.
- **Warband Composition Ideas**:
    - **Ogrish brutes** wielding crude siege weapons.
    - **Corrupted orcs** or **hobgoblins** with giant runes burned into their skin.
    - **Beast handlers** with dire wolves or elemental hounds.
    - A **war shaman** who channels minor giant magic (e.g., earth tremors, stone armor).

### 🧩 **Aftermath**

- The warband may carry **orders or tokens** linking them to a larger force.
- One enemy might mutter about “the pact” or “the Ironblood’s promise” before dying.
- The party now knows: this was no accident—**this was a message**.

One year after the Flaming Retribution, the dwarves of Ironhold begin reclaiming their realm. When the colony of Dagger’s Sheath goes silent, the king calls for brave souls to investigate. The party arrives to find the colony **completely demolished**, with **no survivors**. As they sift through the wreckage, they are **ambushed by a monstrous warband**—subordinates of the giants, long thought extinct.

##### You said:

Let's build out the NPCs in this adventure.

###### Copilot said:

Copilot

To build out the NPCs for your adventure, we'll want a mix of:

### 🧱 Core NPC Types

1. **Royal & Political Figures** – key players in Ironhold’s court.
2. **Antagonists** – the corrupted official, giant leaders, and dark faction agents.
3. **Allies & Informants** – dwarves or others who can aid the party.
4. **Warband Leaders** – monstrous lieutenants with personality and purpose.

---

### 🧙‍♂️ Suggested NPC Roster

#### 🏰 Ironhold Court

- **King Durngar Stoneheart** – Stoic and pragmatic ruler of Ironhold. Survived the Flaming Retribution and now seeks to rebuild. Torn between caution and ambition.
- **Thrain Ironblood** – Ambitious noble and secret traitor. Has made a pact with the giants in exchange for a claim to the crown. Charismatic, calculating, and backed by a dark faction.
- **High Loremaster Baelgrin Deepdelve** – Elder scholar who suspects Thrain but lacks proof. May become a key ally.

#### 🧟‍♂️ Antagonists

- **High Voice of the Stone** – Giant commander orchestrating the warband attacks. Believes the Flaming Retribution was a divine sign to reclaim the surface.
- **The Hollowed Flame** – A secretive cult within Ironhold that supports Thrain. They believe the old gods failed and seek power through ancient, forbidden means.

#### ⚔️ Warband Leaders

- **Gorvok the Maul** – Ogre brute who led the attack on Dagger’s Sheath. Brutal, loyal to the giants, and wears dwarven armor as trophies.
- **Skarn the Emberborn** – Elemental servitor who channels fire and stone. Speaks in riddles and believes in the giants’ divine right to rule.

#### 🛠️ Allies & Informants

- **Captain Brynja Stonefist** – Veteran of the colony guard who escaped the initial attack but is wounded and hiding in the mountains.
- **Runecarver Thaldrin** – A dwarven artificer who recognizes the runes used by the giants and can help decipher their plans.

Copilot

Here are full backgrounds, ambitions, and motivations for each major NPC in _Echoes in Dagger’s Sheath_:

---

## 🏰 **King Durngar Stoneheart**

- **Background**: A veteran of the Second Age wars and survivor of the Flaming Retribution, Durngar was once a general before ascending to the throne after the previous king perished in the cataclysm. He led the dwarves into the mountains and oversaw the fortification of Ironhold.
- **Ambition**: To restore the dwarven kingdom to its former glory and ensure its survival for generations.
- **Motivation**: Durngar is driven by duty and legacy. He believes the dwarves must reclaim their place in the world, but fears that rushing expansion could expose them to unknown threats. His cautious optimism makes him vulnerable to manipulation by more ambitious nobles.

---

## 🛡️ **Thrain Ironblood (Corrupted Noble)**

- **Background**: Thrain is a descendant of a royal bloodline that once vied for the throne. He was passed over in favor of Durngar due to his reputation for ruthlessness and ambition. After the Flaming Retribution, Thrain saw an opportunity to rise.
- **Ambition**: To claim the crown of Ironhold and reshape the kingdom under his rule.

can you make sure that there are no npc names that don't appear in The Hobbit or Lord of the Rings?

###### Copilot said:

Copilot

Thanks! Based on the character lists from _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_, here are some names that **should be changed** to avoid overlap with Tolkien’s works:

### ❌ Names to Replace

- **Thrain Ironblood** – “Thrain” is a canonical dwarf name (father of Thorin).
- **Thaldrin** – Very close to “Thranduil” and “Thorin.”
- **Balin** – Already a major dwarf in both _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_.

### ✅ Updated NPC Names (Unique to Your World)

Here are revised names for your NPCs that maintain their flavor but avoid Tolkien overlap:

|Original Name|Updated Name|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|King Durngar Stoneheart|**King Hargrin Deepmantle**|Regal, dwarven, unique|
|Thrain Ironblood|**Varric Silvervein**|Noble, ominous|
|High Voice of the Stone|**Grondar Earthcaller**|Giant, mythic|
|Gorvok the Maul|**Brukk Stonefist**|Brutal, ogre-like|
|Skarn the Emberborn|**Ashmaw Flamebound**|Elemental, evocative|
|Captain Brynja Stonefist|**Captain Kaela Ironmark**|Strong, dwarven|
|Runecarver Thaldrin|**Eldrin Runeweaver**|Scholarly, arcane|

Since the Giants are thought to be extinct, how did Varric and Grondar meet to form their alliance?

###### Copilot said:

Copilot

Here’s a compelling explanation for how Varric Silvervein and Grondar Earthcaller—two figures from vastly different worlds—formed their secret alliance:

---

## 🤝 The Pact in the Deep

### 📜 **The Catalyst**

In the months following the Flaming Retribution, Varric Silvervein began exploring ancient dwarven vaults beneath Ironhold—places sealed since the Second Age. He sought forgotten power, relics, and leverage to challenge King Hargrin’s rule. In one such vault, he uncovered a **collapsed leyline chamber**—a place where elemental energy once flowed freely.

There, he found **giant-carved runes**—not dwarven—and a dormant **stone sigil** that pulsed faintly with residual power. Through experimentation and forbidden texts, Varric reactivated the sigil, unknowingly sending a beacon through the leyline network.

---

### 🪨 **The Awakening**

Far to the north, deep within the mountains, **Grondar Earthcaller**, an ancient stone giant seer, felt the pulse. He interpreted it as a sign: the dwarves had returned to the surface, and the time for the giants’ resurgence had come.

Grondar sent a **dream-message** through the leyline to the one who had awakened the sigil. Varric, already steeped in ambition and bitterness, answered.

---

### 🕯️ **The Meeting**

The two met in a **forgotten temple** carved into the roots of the mountains—neutral ground once used by both dwarves and giants in the earliest days of the First Age. There, they struck a pact:

- **Varric** would sabotage Ironhold from within, weakening its defenses and sowing political division.
- **Grondar** would send monstrous warbands to strike at key locations, starting with Dagger’s Sheath.
- In return, Varric would be crowned king of a “new Ironhold,” ruling under the giants’ protection.

---

### 🔥 **Shared Motivations**

- **Varric** seeks power and legacy. He believes the dwarves must evolve or perish—and that he is the only one with the will to lead them into a new age.
- **Grondar** seeks restoration and vengeance. He believes the dwarves upset the elemental balance and must be humbled or destroyed.

Would you like this woven into a scene or flashback the players can discover—perhaps through a vision, a recovered journal, or a captured warband lieutenant?

##### You said:

Let's work this into the full adventure. I don't want the players to see this, but I want to show the effects of this and create scenes that display that overall political atmosphere and I want to see the adventure take shape through everything we have discussed so far.

###### Copilot said:

Copilot

Here’s how we can shape the full adventure of _Echoes in Dagger’s Sheath_ into a cohesive, politically charged, exploration-driven campaign. This version integrates the secret alliance between **Varric Silvervein** and **Grondar Earthcaller**, showing its effects through scenes, factions, and environmental storytelling—without revealing the truth to the players until the right moment.

###### Copilot said:

Copilot

Kelda Deepshiver is not a “good guy” in the traditional sense—she is a member of the dark faction loyal to Varric Silvervein. While she presents herself as a serene and wise rune priestess, her true allegiance lies with the Hollowed Flame, a secretive cult that believes the old gods failed and seeks to awaken ancient, forbidden powers.

### 🕯️ Kelda Deepshiver – Rune Priestess of the Hollowed Flame

- **Public Persona**: Respected spiritual advisor and scholar of ancient runes.
- **True Role**: Occultist and ritualist working to empower Varric’s rise and the giants’ resurgence.
- **Motivation**: Kelda believes the dwarves must embrace forgotten powers to survive the new age. She sees Varric as the key to unlocking a future where dwarves wield elemental forces once reserved for giants.
- **Arc**: She may guide the party early on, offering cryptic wisdom and spiritual insight. Later, she could be revealed as a conspirator performing rituals to destabilize Ironhold’s defenses or awaken ancient forces beneath the mountains.

Would you like her to have a secret sanctum or ritual site the players might discover later in the campaign?

##### You said:

Yes, let's write Thorek's background.

###### Copilot said:

Copilot

Here’s a full character background for **Thorek Ironbrow**, your royal blacksmith and weapons master:

---

## 🔨 Thorek Ironbrow – Royal Blacksmith of Ironhold

- **Race**: Dwarf
- **Gender**: Male
- **Alignment**: Lawful Neutral
- **Role**: Master of the Forge, Keeper of the King’s Armory
- **Faction**: Loyal to King Hargrin Deepmantle

### 🧱 Background

Thorek Ironbrow was born into a long line of smiths who served the royal family of Ironhold. His father perished during the Flaming Retribution while sealing the gates of the Deepforge to protect the last of the dwarven relics. Thorek inherited not only his father’s hammer but also the burden of preserving the kingdom’s martial legacy.

He rose to prominence during the reconstruction of Ironhold’s inner defenses, forging weapons and armor for the king’s elite guard. His craftsmanship is unmatched, and his loyalty to King Hargrin is absolute. He views the forge as sacred—a place where dwarven strength is reborn with every strike of the hammer.

### 🎯 Ambition

To restore the Deepforge to its full glory and ensure that Ironhold is never again caught unprepared.

### 🔥 Motivation

Thorek is driven by duty, legacy, and a deep-seated belief that the strength of the dwarves lies in their steel. He distrusts politics and sees Varric’s rise as a threat to the unity and discipline of the kingdom. Though not a courtly man, he commands respect through action and integrity.

### 🧩 Adventure Hooks

- He may offer the party custom-forged weapons or armor if they prove themselves.
- He suspects sabotage in the forge’s supply lines—possibly linked to Varric’s faction.
- If assassinated or framed, his death would send shockwaves through the loyalist ranks.

##### You said:

Let's write Bramli's background.

###### Copilot said:

Copilot

Here’s a full character background for **Bramli Stoneguard**, your royal guard captain:

---

## 🛡️ Bramli Stoneguard – Captain of the Royal Guard

- **Race**: Dwarf
- **Gender**: Male
- **Alignment**: Lawful Good
- **Role**: Defender of the Throne, Commander of the King’s Shield
- **Faction**: Loyal to King Hargrin Deepmantle

### 🧱 Background

Bramli was born into a long-standing military family that has served the royal line of Ironhold for generations. He trained in the Stoneguard Barracks from a young age, rising through the ranks not by bloodline, but by sheer discipline and unwavering loyalty. During the Flaming Retribution, Bramli led the evacuation of the outer halls, personally holding the gate long enough for hundreds to escape into the deep strongholds.

After the cataclysm, King Hargrin appointed him Captain of the Royal Guard—a position Bramli treats as both a sacred duty and a personal oath. He is known for his unshakable presence, his strict adherence to protocol, and his deep suspicion of political maneuvering.

### 🎯 Ambition

To protect the throne and ensure that Ironhold remains united and secure from both external and internal threats.

### 🔥 Motivation

Bramli believes that the greatest threat to Ironhold is not the giants, but division from within. He sees Varric Silvervein’s rise as a slow rot in the foundation of dwarven unity. Though not a politician, Bramli keeps a close eye on the court and quietly supports those who remain loyal to the king.

### 🧩 Adventure Hooks

- May assign the party a covert mission to investigate suspicious troop movements or missing supplies.
- Could be framed for a political assassination to destabilize the king’s inner circle.
- If killed or incapacitated, it would leave the king vulnerable and signal a major shift in the power balance.

Here’s a full character background for **Marnak Deepforge**, your mining guildmaster with hidden ambitions:

---

## ⛏️ Marnak Deepforge – Guildmaster of the Ironhold Miners’ Consortium

- **Race**: Dwarf
- **Gender**: Male
- **Alignment**: Lawful Neutral (with shades of ambition)
- **Role**: Master of Mining Operations, Economic Powerbroker
- **Faction**: Secretly aligned with Varric Silvervein

### 🧱 Background

Marnak Deepforge rose from humble beginnings in the lower tunnels of Ironhold. A brilliant surveyor and shrewd negotiator, he unified several competing mining clans under the Ironhold Miners’ Consortium, becoming one of the most influential non-noble dwarves in the kingdom. His success earned him a seat at the king’s economic council, though he has always resented the nobles who look down on his “dirty hands.”

After the Flaming Retribution, Marnak was instrumental in reopening collapsed tunnels and restoring ore flow to the forges. But he also discovered something else—**a hidden vein of crystal-laced stone etched with ancient runes**, deep beneath the mountains. He brought this secret to Varric Silvervein, seeing in him a kindred spirit: a dwarf who would break the old order and reward those who built Ironhold from the ground up.

### 🎯 Ambition

To become the first common-born dwarf to sit on the royal council as a peer—and to control the kingdom’s most powerful resource veins.

### 🔥 Motivation

Marnak believes the nobility has failed Ironhold. He sees Varric’s rise as a chance to reshape the kingdom into a meritocracy—one where wealth and results matter more than bloodlines. His loyalty is not to Varric personally, but to the vision of a new Ironhold where dwarves like him are no longer second-class citizens.

### 🧩 Adventure Hooks

- May offer the party access to restricted tunnels or resources—at a price.
- Could be caught falsifying mining reports or diverting materials to Varric’s faction.
- If exposed, he may try to buy his way out or turn on Varric to save himself.

###### Copilot said:

Copilot

Here’s a full character background for **Captain Kaela Ironmark**, your loyal dwarven scout and survivor of Dagger’s Sheath:

---

## 🛡️ Captain Kaela Ironmark – Veteran Scout of Ironhold

- **Race**: Dwarf
- **Gender**: Female
- **Alignment**: Lawful Neutral
- **Role**: Scout Commander, Survivor of Dagger’s Sheath
- **Faction**: Loyal to King Hargrin Deepmantle

### 🧱 Background

Kaela Ironmark was born in the outer reaches of Ironhold, raised among the mountain patrols and trained in the art of survival, tracking, and reconnaissance. She earned her captaincy after leading a daring rescue mission during a border skirmish in the Second Age. Known for her sharp instincts and unshakable composure, she was chosen to lead the security detail for the colony of Dagger’s Sheath.

When the colony was attacked, Kaela fought to the last. She managed to escape with a handful of wounded scouts, navigating treacherous mountain passes to return to Ironhold. Most of her companions died along the way. She now carries the weight of their loss and the burden of unfinished duty.

### 🎯 Ambition

To ensure Ironhold never again sends its people into danger unprepared—and to uncover the truth behind the fall of Dagger’s Sheath.

### 🔥 Motivation

Kaela is driven by guilt and loyalty. She believes she failed her people and is determined to make it right. She suspects the attack was no random act of violence and is quietly gathering evidence of sabotage or betrayal.

### 🧩 Adventure Hooks

- She may serve as the party’s initial contact or field commander.
- Could provide firsthand accounts of the warband’s tactics and strange behavior.
- Might be targeted for assassination if she gets too close to uncovering Varric’s involvement.

Here’s a full character background for **Eldrin Runeweaver**, your dwarven artificer and lorekeeper:

---

## 📚 Eldrin Runeweaver – Scholar of the Deep Runes

- **Race**: Dwarf
- **Gender**: Male
- **Alignment**: Neutral Good
- **Role**: Artificer, Historian, Keeper of Forbidden Lore
- **Faction**: Loyal to King Hargrin Deepmantle

### 🧱 Background

Eldrin Runeweaver was once a professor of arcane theory at the Arcane Academy in Lumopolis before it was destroyed in the Flaming Retribution. He survived by sheer luck—on sabbatical in Ironhold, researching dwarven rune traditions when the cataclysm struck. Since then, he has remained in Ironhold, dedicating himself to preserving what knowledge remains and uncovering the secrets buried beneath the mountains.

Eldrin is one of the few dwarves who understands the ancient leyline networks and the resonance of the Llano. He has grown increasingly concerned by the resurgence of elemental disturbances and the appearance of hybrid runes—dwarven in form, but giant in origin.

### 🎯 Ambition

To recover and protect the lost magical heritage of the dwarves and prevent it from being twisted by those who seek power.

### 🔥 Motivation

Eldrin is driven by a deep reverence for knowledge and a fear of history repeating itself. He sees Varric’s rise and the warband’s rune-marked weapons as signs of a deeper corruption. Though not a warrior, he is willing to risk everything to ensure the truth is not buried again.

### 🧩 Adventure Hooks

- May provide the party with magical insight or rune-based tools.
- Could be the first to recognize the signs of a dwarven-giant magical fusion.
- Might be targeted by the Hollowed Flame for knowing too much.

Copilot

Here’s a full character background for **Grondar Earthcaller**, your stone giant commander and elemental warlord:

---

## 🪨 Grondar Earthcaller – High Voice of the Stone

- **Race**: Stone Giant
- **Gender**: Male
- **Alignment**: Neutral Evil
- **Role**: Commander of the Giant Warbands, Elemental Seer
- **Faction**: Leader of the resurgent giants, allied with Varric Silvervein

### 🧱 Background

Grondar Earthcaller is one of the oldest living stone giants, a relic of the Second Age who witnessed the rise and fall of empires from the shadows of the mountains. He was once a spiritual leader among his kind, interpreting the tremors of the earth and the flow of leyline energy. When the dwarves drove the giants into hiding centuries ago, Grondar retreated into the deep caverns, preserving ancient knowledge and waiting for a sign.

That sign came with the **Flaming Retribution**. As meteors fell and the land cracked, Grondar felt the leyline network pulse with renewed energy. He interpreted this as a divine signal: the surface world was weakened, and the giants could rise again. Through ancient rituals, he reactivated dormant leyline chambers and reached out to those who would aid his cause—including **Varric Silvervein**, whose ambition aligned with Grondar’s vision of a reshaped world.

### 🎯 Ambition

To restore the giants’ dominion over the mountains and reclaim the elemental balance disrupted by dwarven expansion.

### 🔥 Motivation

Grondar believes the dwarves have corrupted the natural order with their forges, mines, and magic. He sees himself not as a conqueror, but as a purifier—returning the world to its primal state. His alliance with Varric is strategic; he intends to use the dwarf’s influence to fracture Ironhold from within, then crush the remnants under stone and flame.

### 🧩 Adventure Hooks

- His warbands bear runes that blend giant and dwarven styles—evidence of Varric’s influence.
- He may attempt to awaken a dormant elemental guardian beneath Ironhold.
- The party could uncover his leyline sanctum and disrupt his rituals, weakening the warbands.

Here’s a full character background for **Grondar Earthcaller’s lieutenant**, a powerful and loyal stone giant warrior:

---

## 🪓 Name: Korrak Flintshard – Hammer of the Deep

- **Race**: Stone Giant
- **Gender**: Male
- **Alignment**: Neutral Evil
- **Role**: Grondar’s Field Commander and Enforcer
- **Faction**: Giant Warband

### 🧱 Background

Korrak Flintshard was born in the deep caverns beneath the Shattered Peaks, raised among the remnants of a once-proud stone giant clan. As a youth, he was marked by a prophecy carved into the cavern walls: “The hammer shall rise when the mountain breaks.” When the Flaming Retribution shattered the surface and awakened the leyline beneath his ancestral home, Korrak took it as a sign.

He was among the first to answer Grondar Earthcaller’s call, pledging his strength and loyalty to the High Voice of the Stone. Korrak believes in the old ways—strength, endurance, and the right of the giants to rule the mountains. He views dwarves as parasites who hollow out the bones of the world and must be driven out.

### 🎯 Ambition

To become the warlord of the surface once the dwarves are defeated and to restore the ancient dominion of the stone giants.

### 🔥 Motivation

Korrak is driven by prophecy, pride, and a deep hatred for the dwarves who he believes desecrated his ancestors’ sacred halls. He sees himself as the hammer of retribution, chosen to break the dwarves and reclaim the mountains.

### 🧩 Adventure Hooks

- Leads the warband that destroyed Dagger’s Sheath.
- May be encountered again leading a siege or guarding a leyline ritual site.
- Could be a mid-campaign boss fight or a recurring antagonist who escapes and returns stronger.

Here’s a full character background for **High Loremaster Baelgrin Deepdelve**, your elder scholar and quiet ally to the king:

---

## 📚 High Loremaster Baelgrin Deepdelve – Keeper of the Deep Records

- **Race**: Dwarf
- **Gender**: Male
- **Alignment**: Lawful Neutral
- **Role**: Senior Scholar of Ironhold, Advisor to the King
- **Faction**: Loyal to King Hargrin Deepmantle

### 🧱 Background

Baelgrin Deepdelve has served the royal court of Ironhold for over a century, having earned his title through decades of study, excavation, and translation of ancient dwarven texts. He is one of the few remaining scholars who remembers the world before the Flaming Retribution and has firsthand knowledge of the kingdom’s lost outer holdings.

He was once a field archaeologist, known for his expeditions into the ruins of the First and Second Ages. After a cave-in nearly claimed his life, he retired to the archives and became the kingdom’s foremost authority on dwarven history, rune lore, and ancient treaties. His memory is sharp, and his instincts are rarely wrong.

### 🎯 Ambition

To preserve the truth of dwarven history and ensure that Ironhold does not repeat the mistakes of the past.

### 🔥 Motivation

Baelgrin is deeply suspicious of Varric Silvervein’s rise and the sudden resurgence of ancient runes bearing both dwarven and giantic influence. He believes something is stirring beneath the surface—something that echoes the darkest chapters of dwarven history. Though not a warrior, he is a quiet force of resistance, working behind the scenes to uncover the truth.

### 🧩 Adventure Hooks

- May provide the party with ancient maps, forgotten prophecies, or access to sealed archives.
- Could be targeted by the Hollowed Flame for knowing too much.
- Might leave behind a coded journal or rune-locked vault if assassinated.

Here’s a full character background for **Gorvok the Maul**, your brutal ogre warband leader:

---

## 🪓 Gorvok the Maul – Breaker of Dagger’s Sheath

- **Race**: Ogre
- **Gender**: Male
- **Alignment**: Chaotic Evil
- **Role**: Warband Enforcer, Frontline Commander
- **Faction**: Serves Grondar Earthcaller and the resurgent giants

### 🧱 Background

Gorvok was born into the brutal hierarchy of the Fire Walker Tribe, a monstrous faction known for its devotion to destruction and its servitude to dark elemental forces. As a young ogre, Gorvok was used as a pit fighter and shock trooper, surviving by sheer brutality and cunning. His rise through the ranks was marked by bloodshed, betrayal, and the ritual slaying of his own war-chief.

When Grondar Earthcaller began assembling his warbands in the wake of the Flaming Retribution, Gorvok was among the first to answer the call. He saw in Grondar not just a leader, but a godlike figure who promised him endless war and the chance to carve his name into the bones of the world. Gorvok was given command of the first strike force and led the assault that annihilated Dagger’s Sheath.

### 🎯 Ambition

To become the most feared warlord of the new age and to earn a place at Grondar’s side as his chosen executioner.

### 🔥 Motivation

Gorvok is driven by rage, pride, and a deep hatred for civilization. He sees dwarves as weaklings hiding behind stone and tradition. Every ruin he leaves behind is a monument to his strength. He wears pieces of dwarven armor as trophies and paints his maul with the blood of fallen defenders.

### 🧩 Adventure Hooks

- The party may find his war banner or personal sigil among the wreckage of Dagger’s Sheath.
- Survivors or scouts may describe him in fearful whispers, building him up as a monstrous legend.
- He could serve as a mid-campaign boss fight or return later, stronger and more brutal, for a climactic rematch.

Here’s a full character background for **Skarn the Emberborn**, your elemental servitor and fanatic flamecaster:

---

## 🔥 Skarn the Emberborn – Voice of the Flame

- **Race**: Elemental (Fire-infused)
- **Gender**: Male (masculine-coded)
- **Alignment**: Neutral Evil
- **Role**: Elemental Servitor, Ritualist, Warband Support
- **Faction**: Serves Grondar Earthcaller and the elemental cause

### 🧱 Background

Skarn was not born—he was **forged**. During the early resurgence of the giants, Grondar Earthcaller performed a ritual deep within a leyline chamber corrupted by the Flaming Retribution. The ritual called upon the elemental forces of fire and stone to create a living weapon. From the molten core of the mountain, Skarn emerged—a being of flame and fury, bound by runes and purpose.

Though he speaks little, Skarn is known to chant in ancient tongues during battle, invoking forgotten elemental names and prophecies. He believes the world must be **cleansed**—burned down to its bones so that a new age may rise. He sees the giants as the rightful stewards of this rebirth and serves Grondar with unwavering devotion.

### 🎯 Ambition

To awaken the elemental heart of the mountains and bring about a new age of fire and stone.

### 🔥 Motivation

Skarn is driven by **fanaticism** and **elemental instinct**. He views dwarves as parasites who have mined too deep and too greedily, disturbing the balance of the world. His magic is not just destructive—it is **ritualistic**, meant to reshape the land and purge the old order.

### 🧩 Adventure Hooks

- His runes may match those found in corrupted dwarven relics, hinting at Varric’s involvement.
- He could be encountered performing a ritual to awaken a dormant elemental guardian.
- If defeated, his essence may linger, corrupting the land or whispering through flame.

I want to update the adventure. I think the first scene will be the party meeting the King with some of his trusted advisors. (which includes the enemy spy npc) He explains that something went wrong with Dagger's Sheath, but he is unable to launch a full investigation due to political ramifications. Then I want to cut to Dagger's sheath (completely destroyed with no apparent survivors) where the party gets attacked by Gorvok the Maul and his war party. After that I want you to help me build out the rest of the adventure with the party discovering that the Giants are back and trying to navigate the complex political environment for the King. This should be 4-6 sessions long.

I want a story outline with the overall scenes that we are planning to happen in the order that they are intended to be. I don't want every npc to be present in every scene, I want them to be in a place that makes sense. I want this to be a game that balances the politics in Ironhold, and the threat of the Giant invasion. The PCs are going to be an independent third party to the whole situation being able to choose the side that they want, or no side at all. I do expect them to want to save the dwarven kingdom from the giants. I have renamed this adventure to be The Cracked Granite.

---

### 🪓 **Session 0 Introduction – The Cracked Granite**

> _The Fourth Age dawned in fire._
> 
> One year ago, the Flaming Retribution tore across the continent of Solaris. Meteors fell, geysers boiled, and the once-great Blessed Realm was reduced to ash. While kingdoms burned, the dwarves of Ironhold endured—sealed within their mountain strongholds, protected by stone and stubborn will.
> 
> Now, the gates have opened. Ironhold looks outward once more, seeking to reclaim lost lands and rebuild its legacy. Colonies were founded in the north, among them **Dagger’s Sheath**, a beacon of dwarven resilience.
> 
> But something has gone wrong.
> 
> Dagger’s Sheath has gone silent. No messages. No scouts. No survivors.
> 
> The king cannot act openly—political tensions run high, and whispers of betrayal echo through the halls. Instead, he calls upon you: proven adventurers, soldiers, and heroes of Ironhold. You are not pawns of the court, nor bound by faction. You are independent agents, trusted to uncover the truth and act as you see fit.
> 
> What you find may shake the foundations of Ironhold itself.
> 
> Giants—long thought extinct—stir in the mountains. Ancient runes glow once more. And within the halls of power, a dark faction plots to claim the crown.
> 
> You will choose your path. You may serve the king, expose the traitors, or walk your own road. But know this:
> 
> The granite is cracking.
> 
> And what lies beneath may not be so easily buried.

### 🪓 **Session 0 Introduction – The Cracked Granite**

> _The Fourth Age is young, but already scarred._
> 
> A year has passed since the skies burned and the world changed. While kingdoms fell and empires fractured, the dwarves of Ironhold endured—sealed within their mountain halls, shielded by stone and tradition.
> 
> Now, the gates have opened.
> 
> Ironhold looks outward once more, seeking to reclaim its place in the world. The halls echo with the sounds of rebuilding, of reforging old alliances, and of preparing for what lies beyond the granite walls.
> 
> You are dwarves of renown—adventurers, soldiers, champions. Whether born of noble blood or hardened in the mines, your deeds have earned you respect. You are not bound by politics or clan feuds. You are trusted to act with strength, wisdom, and honor.
> 
> The world beyond the stone is uncertain. The future of Ironhold may rest in your hands.
> 
> Choose your path. Forge your legacy. And remember:

> Stone may crack.

###### Copilot said:

It looks like you're referring to “The Cracked Granite,” your dwarven-themed adventure. If something didn’t come out right—like an image or a response—let’s fix it. Could you clarify what you meant by “Crecked Granite” or what you were expecting to see? I’m here to help get it exactly how you want it.

##### You said:

I am referring to the image that we have been trying to generate, I keep giving you specific instructions on what I want, but you keep screwing it up.

###### Copilot said:

Copilot

Thanks for being direct—I really appreciate that. Let’s get this right.

You’ve been asking for a **1920x1080 image** with a **dwarven-themed frame** that is:

- Fully visible and **not clipped**
- Has a **solid white background**
- Has a **solid white interior**
- Includes a **decorative border**
- Is **scaled down** enough to fit entirely within the canvas
- Has **exactly 10 pixels of white space** between the left/right edges of the frame and the canvas edges

I understand now that the previous generations were still clipping the sides, and that’s unacceptable. I’ll regenerate the image with **precise scaling and padding** to ensure the entire frame is fully visible and centered within the 1920x1080 canvas.

Let me fix this for you right now.

Generating your corrected 1920x1080 frame now with exact 10-pixel white padding on both sides, fully visible and centered, with a solid white interior and background. It will appear shortly and be ready for Foundry VTT. Let me know if you'd like a version with a title banner or compass rose!

##### You said:

Okay, let's take a step back. I would like the canvas to be a 2,100x2,100 px canvas. I want the background to be solid white, I want a dwarven style frame in the center of the canvas that is the interior dimensions of the frame to be 1900x1080 px, with Glowing Blue runes and dwarven decoration.

is the interior of this frame 1920x1200?

Thanks for your patience. Based on the analysis, the interior of the frame in the most recent image is not exactly 1920x1200 pixels. If you need the interior dimensions to be precisely 1920x1200 within a 2100x2100 canvas, I can regenerate the image with that exact specification.

You've just uploaded a rich collection of lore documents that deepen the mythos of **_The Cracked Granite_** and the world of **Aetheria**. Here's a categorized summary to help you navigate and integrate these elements into your campaign:

---

### 🔥 **Cataclysmic Events**

- **The War of Fractured Dawn**: A divine civil war in the Second Age where corrupted La Pelu (Vorath, Syrith, Maldran) became the Shadow Kin. The Veilcant Guard formed to protect the Llano and ultimately fractured it to prevent further divine catastrophe.

- **Sentinels of Equilibrium**: Guardians of balance, neutrality, and cosmic harmony.
- **Veilcant Guard**: Legendary fellowship of La Pelu who fractured the Llano and sealed their relics to protect the world. Your party may be their reincarnated successors.

---

### 🐸 **Tribal Lore**

- **Namar'Zul**: A nomadic Tripkee tribe guided by Uhlvara, living atop the shell of a titanic sea turtle named Oloru. They survived the Flaming Retribution and now dwell in a volatile swamp, facing elemental and undead threats.

You've now uploaded the full divine cosmology of **Aetheria**, including gods, divine ranks, and the mythic La Pelu. Here's a structured summary to help you integrate these into your campaign:

---

### ☀️ **The Luminous Authority** (Supreme Deities)

These are the most powerful gods, embodiments of cosmic principles:

- **Raythelion** – _The Creator and Sustainer_: Sun god, origin of all existence. All other gods are aspects of him. His corrupted La Pelu ended the Golden Age.
- **Aurion** – _The Prime Architect_: God of creation and inspiration. Patron of artists, inventors, and visionaries.
- **Justicar** – _The Scalebearer_: God of justice, order, and balance. Patron of judges and lawkeepers.
- **Verdanth** – _The Greenwarden_: Goddess of nature, growth, and renewal. Patron of druids, healers, and farmers.

---

### 🌟 **The Rank of Brilliance** (Cosmic Forces)

These deities govern abstract but essential forces:

- **Shananooah** – _The Time Weaver_: Goddess of time, fate, and continuity. Oversees the flow of past, present, and future.

---

### 🔍 **The Rank of Guiding Luminescence** (Worldly Patrons)

These gods are more involved in mortal affairs:

- **Uhlvara** – _The Seeker in the Wilds_: God of the hunt, discovery, and lost knowledge. Patron of the Tripkee and the Namar'Zul.
- **Cadens** – _The Melodic Maestro_: God of music, harmony, and inspiration. Patron of bards and artists.

---

### 🌑 **The Dark Pantheon** (Fallen Powers)

Led by a former member of the Luminous Authority:

- **Erabose** – _The Sovereign of Shadows_: God of corruption, destruction, and ambition. Master of the Shadow Kin and corrupter of the La Pelu.

---

### ⚔️ **The La Pelu** (Sun Swords)

Chosen champions of Raythelion, reincarnated in times of crisis:

- Once revered, now feared due to the corruption of Maldran, Syrith, and Vorath.
- Possess divine powers: glowing auras, innate spells, and radiant abilities.
- Hunted by the **Order of the Dawnguard** and **Sentinels of Equilibrium** to prevent another catastrophe.

---

### 🎶 **Cadens & the Llano**

- **Cadens** is deeply tied to the **Llano**, the Song of Creation.
- His followers believe music is a divine force that can heal, inspire, and reveal truth.

---

###### Copilot said:

Copilot

Here’s a summary of the two species you've uploaded, which add rich cultural and factional depth to your world:

---

### 🐸 **Tripkee**

- **Description**: Small, nomadic frogfolk about the size of gnomes or halflings.
- **Habitat**: Swamps and marshlands.
- **Culture**: Guided by their patron deity **Uhlvara**, the Seeker in the Wilds. They are elusive and spiritual, with little known about their internal customs.
- **Notable Tribe**: The **Namar'Zul**, who live atop the divine turtle **Oloru** and survived the Flaming Retribution.

---

### 🔥 **Goblins**

- **General Traits**: Small, green, mischievous, and often destructive. They have a penchant for chaos and explosions.

#### **Fire Walker Tribe**

- **Appearance**: Green skin with red, cracked patterns.
- **Allegiance**: Serve a **Coven of Hags**.
- **Culture**: Ruthless, hierarchical, and destructive. They value strength and practice slavery, often using captives as cannon fodder.
- **Goal**: Destruction of civilization and brotherhood.
- **Weakness**: Their cohesion depends on the Hag Coven. Without it, they risk internal collapse or violent power struggles.

#### **The Burned Wood Goblins**

- **Origin**: Formerly warring tribes now enslaved by the Fire Walkers.
- **Current Status**: Led by **Grimfang**, an older goblin. They are a survival-focused, ragtag group with potential to evolve into a new culture.

Okay I am wanting to finish off my foundry landing page. I want to build the page with 3 character portraits in the top center and a framed picture on the page. the foundry controls cover up the right and left hand sides. is there anyway that you could provide a cool layout for me on my 1920x1080 screen?

###### Copilot said:

Copilot

Here comes your custom Foundry VTT landing page layout—designed for a 1920x1080 screen with space for three character portraits at the top center and a framed image area below, all styled with dwarven motifs and glowing blue runes. The left and right edges are intentionally left blank to accommodate Foundry's UI controls. Let’s take a look!

##### You said:

that looks great can you remove all the drop-shadows, add name plates on the character portrait frames and make the inside and outside of the frames flat white.

###### Copilot said:

Here comes your updated Foundry VTT landing page layout—now with solid white interiors and exteriors, no drop shadows, and decorative nameplates on the character portrait frames. The layout is centered on a 2100x2100 canvas with 200-pixel white margins on each side for UI compatibility. Let’s take a look!

##### You said:

I like the portraits (3 frames to the top), but I want the lower frame to be just a frame with no name plates and I want the inside of the frame to be flat white. Leave the dwarven runes on the frame.

The Dwarves of Atheria don't have their own pantheon, but they do revere Certain gods higher than others. Primarily focused on the Guiding Luminescence's of industry and crafting as well as the Rank of Brilliance around the Elements that reign over the elements that can be used in industry and artistry. Can you help me build out some of the deities around thes spaces?

###### Copilot said:

I would also like to flesh out a couple of gods from the Dark Pantheon of Erabose, that evil dwarves might worship

###### Copilot said:

Copilot

Thanks! Based on the lore from the Dark Pantheon of Erabose, here are two original evil-aligned deities that dwarves—particularly those who have turned away from tradition or been seduced by power—might secretly revere:

---

## 🕳️ **Dholgrym, the Hollow Flame**

- **Title**: The Ember That Consumes
- **Domain**: Greed, sabotage, false light
- **Symbol**: A blackened flame inside a cracked gemstone
- **Worshippers**: Corrupt merchants, saboteurs, and dwarves who seek wealth and power through ruin
- **Tenets**:
    - “Let the forge burn from within.”
    - “What glitters blinds the wise.”
- **Lore**: Dholgrym was once a minor spirit of hearth fires, twisted by Erabose into a god of internal collapse. His cultists infiltrate guilds and forges, spreading distrust and hoarding secrets. They believe true power comes from hollowing out the strong and replacing them from within.

---

## 🪓 **Thazgrun, the Oath-Breaker**

- **Title**: The Shattered Vow
- **Domain**: Betrayal, vengeance, broken bonds
- **Symbol**: A severed chain wrapped around a bloodied axe
- **Worshippers**: Exiled dwarves, oathbreakers, and those who seek revenge against their clans
- **Tenets**:
    - “Oaths are chains. Break them.”
    - “The wound remembers.”
- **Lore**: Thazgrun was once a dwarven hero who turned on his kin during the War of the Fractured Dawn. Now a dark demigod under Erabose, he whispers to the bitter and the betrayed. His followers believe that vengeance is sacred and that loyalty is a lie told by the powerful.

Would you like symbols for these two deities as well? I can also help you create cult cells, rituals, or relics tied to their worship.

I would like to put together a real simple quick player primer for this adventure. My players don't know anything about the clan's their functions or anything else about the dwarves of Aetheria. They all want to be dwarves and I want to give them a bit of a background of the Dwarves of Aetheria. What is important to them, who do they worship, what are some common PF2e classes that the dwarves pick. How does the clan structure work and where to PCs fit into it. Do they want to be a part of a clan or do they want to be clanless and what does that mean? How could their PCs have leveled to level 3?

###### Copilot said:

Copilot

Here’s a concise and engaging player primer for your adventure, **The Cracked Granite**, tailored for players new to the dwarves of Aetheria:

---

## 🛡️ **The Dwarves of Aetheria: A Primer for Players**

### 🏔️ **Who Are the Dwarves of Ironhold?**

The dwarves of Ironhold are a proud, resilient people who survived the cataclysmic **Flaming Retribution** by sealing themselves deep within their mountain strongholds. Now, one year later, they are emerging to reclaim their place in the world.

They value:

- **Craftsmanship** – Every tool, weapon, and rune is a reflection of the soul.
- **Honor and Oaths** – A dwarf’s word is stone.
- **Clan and Kin** – Loyalty to one’s clan is sacred, but not all dwarves belong to one…

---

### 🧭 **Clans of Ironhold**

Dwarven society is structured around **clans**, each with its own function, traditions, and political leanings. Think of them like Scottish clans—tight-knit, proud, and influential.

- **Stoneguard** – Elite warriors and royal protectors (Loyalist)

can you include a section about the over all politics of Ironhold? I would also like to add Gunslinger as a typical class that a dwarf of Ironhold would be and replace Sorcerer with Keneticist. Also, in the Clans of Ironhold section, I would like you to remove the note that describes them as scottish clans. I am happy about the comments about the clan being tight-knit, proud and influential, but don't want to force the thought of Scottish clans. The clans are a combo of Scottish and Viking style clans, but I don't want to tell the players that. Also, I don't want to include any information about the clan's political leanings in this specific primer.

Here’s your updated and expanded **Player Primer** for _The Cracked Granite_, now including a section on Ironhold’s political structure, updated class suggestions, and revised clan descriptions:

---

## 🛡️ **The Dwarves of Aetheria: A Primer for Players**

### 🏔️ **Who Are the Dwarves of Ironhold?**

The dwarves of Ironhold are a proud, resilient people who survived the cataclysmic **Flaming Retribution** by sealing themselves deep within their mountain strongholds. Now, one year later, they are emerging to reclaim their place in the world.

They value:

- **Craftsmanship** – Every tool, weapon, and rune is a reflection of the soul.
- **Honor and Oaths** – A dwarf’s word is stone.
- **Clan and Kin** – Loyalty to one’s clan is sacred, but not all dwarves belong to one…

---

### 🧭 **Clans of Ironhold**

Dwarven society is structured around **clans**, each with its own function, traditions, and influence. Clans are tight-knit, proud, and often wield considerable political or economic power.

- **Stoneguard** – Elite warriors and royal protectors
- **Deepforge** – Miners, engineers, and industrialists
- **Runeweaver** – Scholars, artificers, and lorekeepers
- **Hollowbrand** – Merchants, bankers, and trade brokers
- **Blackshard** – Informants, spies, and covert operatives
- **Deepshiver** – Priests, mystics, and spiritual guides
- **Ironmark** – Scouts, rangers, and border wardens

🪓 **Clanless dwarves** are rare but not unheard of. They may be orphans, exiles, or those who rejected their clan’s politics. Some see them as dangerous. Others see them as free. A clanless dwarf may be mistrusted by traditionalists but respected for their independence.

---

### 🏛️ **Politics of Ironhold**

Ironhold is a **monarchy**, ruled by **King Hargrin Deepmantle**, but the king’s power is balanced by a council of clan leaders, guildmasters, and spiritual advisors. Politics in Ironhold are complex and often subtle—alliances shift, favors are traded, and grudges can last generations.

- **Loyalists** support the king’s vision of cautious expansion and unity.
- **Reformists** seek to modernize Ironhold’s economy and reduce royal control.
- **Radicals** whisper of darker powers and ancient rights.

As a player, your character may be aligned with a faction—or remain independent, trusted by all but beholden to none.

I would like to get a feel for who the Giants worship. The way I am wanting this to go is that the Giants were on the side of Vorath in the great war and they lived beyond the war, but they were not specifically Loyal to him. They were loyal to themselves and their Gods. It just so happened that the goals of the Giant Tribes and the Goals of Vorrath were aligned for a time, so they allied together. The Giants were pushed to the point of extenction about half to 3/4 of the way through the third age. Their society should reflect their alliance to the shadow, and the Dark Pantheon, but they weren't specific henchmen of Vorrath.

###### Copilot said:

Copilot

Thanks for the context! Based on your vision, here’s a framework for the **giant religion and divine alignment** in Aetheria that reflects their independence, elemental power, and historical alliance with the Dark Pantheon—without making them direct servants of Vorath.

---

## 🌑 **The Divine Structure of the Giants of Aetheria**

### 🗻 **Core Belief**

Giants do not worship a single god or unified pantheon. Instead, they revere **primordial forces** and **elemental deities** that embody the raw power of the world. These gods are ancient, often tied to the **Dark Pantheon**, but the giants see them as **allies**, not masters.

Their faith is **tribal and ancestral**, passed through oral tradition, elemental rituals, and sacred sites. Each tribe may elevate different gods depending on their elemental affinity (stone, fire, ice, storm, etc.).

---

## 🔥 **Giants and the Dark Pantheon**

During the **War of the Fractured Dawn**, the goals of the giants aligned with Vorath and Erabose. They fought alongside the Shadow Kin, but not as subordinates. Their loyalty was to their own survival and the restoration of the elemental balance they believed the dwarves and humans had corrupted.

They still revere **Erabose** as a god of destruction and rebirth, but not as a ruler—more as a force of cosmic reckoning.

---

## 🕯️ **Giant-Deified Figures (Dark Pantheon-Aligned)**

### **Erabose, Sovereign of Shadows**

- **Role**: Cosmic destroyer, patron of elemental upheaval
- **Giants’ View**: A necessary force to purge the world of weakness and restore primal order

### **Varnok (Stoneheart)** – Revered by Earth Giants

- Though dwarves see him as a patron of endurance, giants see him as a **sleeping titan**, a god of tectonic wrath and buried truth.

### **Thalgrun (Lord of Flame)** – Revered by Fire Giants

- Giants see him as the **torch of rebirth**, the flame that consumes civilization to make way for raw power.

---

## 🪨 **Unique Giant Deities (Dark-Aligned but Independent)**

### **Ghurmuk, the Deep Pulse**

- **Domain**: Earthquakes, buried power, ancestral memory
- **Symbol**: A cracked mountain with a glowing core
- **Worship**: Stone offerings, seismic chants, cave murals
- **Belief**: Ghurmuk sleeps beneath the world, and his awakening will shatter the surface races

---

### **Skorath, the Ash-Walker**

- **Domain**: Fire, ruin, volcanic rebirth
- **Symbol**: A burning footprint in obsidian
- **Worship**: Ash circles, lava rites, firewalking trials
- **Belief**: Skorath walks the molten paths between worlds, and his steps mark the end of empires

---

### **Thuunra, the Storm Maw**

- **Domain**: Thunder, wrath, divine fury
- **Symbol**: A jagged spiral of lightning around a gaping mouth
- **Worship**: Sky howls, storm dances, bloodletting in rain
- **Belief**: Thuunra devours the weak with storms and speaks through thunder

---

Would you like symbols for these giant deities next, or help designing their sacred sites, rituals, or cults?

##### You said:

None of the Elemental Gods are allied with the dark Pantheon, ever. the Dark Pantheon is like the Devil and his angles. and the other celestial orders of the Gods are like, God, his angles and the Catholic saints in scope, but they would never ally with the devil... ever.

###### Copilot said:

Copilot

Thanks for the clarification—that helps a lot.

Here’s a revised theological structure for the **giants of Aetheria**, keeping their elemental gods distinct from the Dark Pantheon, while still reflecting their historical alignment with Vorath during the War of the Fractured Dawn:

---

## 🌩️ **The Giants’ Faith: The Primordial Covenant**

### 🗻 **Core Belief**

Giants revere the **Primordials**—ancient elemental deities who embody the raw forces of the world. These gods are not aligned with the Dark Pantheon, nor with the celestial orders of Raythelion. They are **older**, **untamed**, and **indifferent** to mortal morality.

The giants believe they were shaped by these Primordials to be the rightful stewards of the world. Their war against the surface races was not out of malice, but to restore the **natural order** that civilization disrupted.

---

## 🕯️ **Relationship to the Dark Pantheon**

During the War of the Fractured Dawn, the giants allied with Vorath and Erabose not out of loyalty, but because their goals aligned:

- The giants sought to reclaim the surface and destroy the empires that scarred the land.
- The Dark Pantheon sought to unravel the divine order and plunge the world into chaos.

The alliance was one of **convenience**, not devotion. Giants do not worship Erabose or his fallen angels—but they respect their power and may adopt some of their **symbols or tactics** when it suits them.

---

## 🔥 **The Primordial Gods of the Giants**

### **Ghurmuk, the Deep Pulse**

- **Domain**: Earthquakes, tectonic power, ancestral memory
- **Symbol**: A cracked mountain with a glowing core
- **Worship**: Stone offerings, seismic chants, cave murals

### **Skorath, the Ash-Walker**

- **Domain**: Fire, volcanic rebirth, ruin
- **Symbol**: A burning footprint in obsidian
- **Worship**: Ash circles, lava rites, firewalking trials

### **Thuunra, the Storm Maw**

- **Domain**: Thunder, divine wrath, sky dominion
- **Symbol**: A spiral of lightning around a gaping mouth
- **Worship**: Sky howls, storm dances, bloodletting in rain

### **Nhaldris, the Glacial Veil**

- **Domain**: Ice, stillness, inevitability
- **Symbol**: A frozen eye within a snowflake
- **Worship**: Ice carvings, silence fasts, glacial pilgrimages

---

Would you like to develop **symbols** for these Primordials next, or explore how their worship manifests in **giant culture, architecture, or rituals**?

##### You said:

The Dark pantheon is evil. the Giants do not have redeeming qualities. please build them accordingly.

Thanks for the clarification. Based on your vision, here’s a refined structure for the **giant religion** in Aetheria—distinct from the Dark Pantheon, but equally malevolent and opposed to the divine orders:

---

## 🌋 **The Giants’ Faith: The Elemental Tyranny**

### 🗻 **Core Belief**

Giants worship **Primordial Tyrants**—elemental gods of destruction, domination, and natural supremacy. These deities are ancient, cruel, and indifferent to mortal suffering. They do not seek balance or harmony, but **power through elemental conquest**.

Giants believe they were forged by these tyrants to rule the world, and that civilization (especially dwarves and humans) is a disease upon the land. Their faith is tribal, brutal, and ritualistic—centered on sacrifice, elemental trials, and ancestral bloodlines.

---

## 🔥 **The Primordial Tyrants of the Giants**

### **Ghurmuk, the Deep Pulse**

- **Domain**: Earthquakes, buried wrath, tectonic domination
- **Symbol**: A cracked mountain bleeding molten stone
- **Worship**: Stone sacrifices, cave collapses, seismic chants
- **Belief**: Ghurmuk sleeps beneath the world and will rise to crush the surface races under mountains

---

### **Skorath, the Ash-Walker**

- **Domain**: Fire, ruin, volcanic conquest
- **Symbol**: A burning footprint in obsidian
- **Worship**: Lava rites, firewalking trials, ash offerings
- **Belief**: Skorath walks the molten paths between realms, and his steps mark the end of empires

---

### **Thuunra, the Storm Maw**

- **Domain**: Thunder, divine wrath, sky dominion
- **Symbol**: A jagged spiral of lightning around a gaping mouth
- **Worship**: Sky howls, storm dances, bloodletting in rain
- **Belief**: Thuunra devours the weak with storms and speaks through thunder

---

### **Nhaldris, the Glacial Veil**

- **Domain**: Ice, stillness, inevitability
- **Symbol**: A frozen eye within a snowflake
- **Worship**: Ice carvings, silence fasts, glacial pilgrimages
- **Belief**: Nhaldris freezes the hearts of kings and preserves the bones of fallen civilizations

---

These gods are **not aligned with Erabose or the Dark Pantheon**, but their goals—destruction of divine order, collapse of civilization, and elemental supremacy—have historically aligned with those of Vorath and his followers.

Would you like to generate **symbols** for these Primordial Tyrants next, or build out **giant cults, rituals, or sacred sites** tied to their worship?

##### You said:

All the Dark pantheon is aligned with Erabose. The Giants are loyal to the Gods, they were not Loyal to Vorrath who was not a god at all. He was a fallen La Pelu, which is a demi god in this setting. The Giants serve the Dark pantheon, but are not loyal to any non gods that are not a part of the Giant Tribes.

###### Copilot said:

Copilot

Perfect—thank you for the clarification. Here's a refined theological and cultural structure for the **giants of Aetheria**, fully aligned with the Dark Pantheon but distinct from mortal or demi-divine allegiances:

---

## 🌑 **The Giants of Aetheria: Servants of the Dark Pantheon**

### 🗻 **Core Belief**

The giants are ancient, malevolent beings who believe they were forged to dominate the mortal world. They are **devout servants of the Dark Pantheon**, particularly **Erabose**, whom they revere as the rightful sovereign of all divine power. Their elemental gods are not neutral forces of nature—they are **corrupted reflections** of elemental power, twisted by shadow and ambition.

The giants see themselves as the **chosen instruments of divine ruin**, and their society is built around conquest, domination, and the worship of **dark elemental deities** who serve Erabose’s will.

---

## 🕯️ **Relationship to Vorath**

Vorath, as a fallen La Pelu, was never a god—merely a powerful demigod. The giants allied with him during the War of the Fractured Dawn because his goals aligned with theirs: the destruction of the divine orders and the collapse of mortal empires. But they never served him. Their loyalty has always been to the **true gods of the Dark Pantheon**.

---

## 🔥 **The Dark Elemental Gods of the Giants**

These gods are **fully aligned with Erabose**, and their worship is central to giant culture. Each tribe may elevate one above the others, but all are venerated as aspects of divine ruin.

---

### **Molgrath, the Ember Tyrant**

- **Domain**: Fire, destruction, conquest
- **Symbol**: A burning crown atop a blackened anvil
- **Worship**: Fire sacrifices, forge-blood rites, volcanic pilgrimages
- **Belief**: Molgrath teaches that fire is the rightful end of all things. He is the patron of fire giants and warlords.

---

### **Tharuum, the Stone Reaper**

- **Domain**: Earth, decay, inevitability
- **Symbol**: A crumbling skull embedded in stone
- **Worship**: Burial rites, cave collapses, petrification rituals
- **Belief**: Tharuum whispers that all things return to stone. He is revered by hill giants and earthbound seers.

---

### **Vexira, the Shard Queen**

- **Domain**: Ice, cruelty, stillness
- **Symbol**: A frozen crown of jagged crystal
- **Worship**: Ice fasts, bloodletting in snow, glacial tombs
- **Belief**: Vexira teaches that mercy is weakness. She is worshipped by frost giants and executioners.

---

### **Zhurak, the Maw of Storms**

- **Domain**: Wind, chaos, wrath
- **Symbol**: A spiral of black lightning around a screaming mouth
- **Worship**: Sky duels, thunder chants, storm-forged weapons
- **Belief**: Zhurak demands that the strong rise and the weak be cast down. He is honored by storm giants and berserkers.

I want to create a different session 0 intro than the one I did before. I want this intro to go through the dwarves society, and how they are structured, how they survived the flaming retribution. The political differences of the 2 factions of Isolationist dwarves and dwarves that wish to reenter the world and the general political climate, as well as the Dwarven Kings desire to establish the kingdom again and how they have sent out dwarven colonys into the world to reestablish a foothold. I want to be able to read this pretty quickly to my players first thing before they start making characters, to help them decide what kind of dwarf they want to make.

###### Copilot said:

Here’s a streamlined and engaging **Session 0 introduction** for _The Cracked Granite_, focused on dwarven society, survival, politics, and the king’s ambitions—designed to be read aloud before character creation:

---

## 🛡️ **Session 0 Introduction – The Cracked Granite**

> _The Fourth Age is young, but the dwarves of Ironhold are older still._

When the Flaming Retribution scorched the surface world, the dwarves did not burn. They sealed their gates, reinforced their halls, and endured. For a year, Ironhold remained silent—its people surviving by stone, steel, and stubborn will.

Now, the gates have opened.

Ironhold is a kingdom of clans. Each clan has its own traditions, its own strengths—miners, warriors, scholars, traders, mystics, scouts. Some dwarves are born into these clans. Others walk alone, clanless but not without purpose.

The king, Hargrin Deepmantle, believes the time has come to reclaim the surface. He has sent out colonies—small footholds in the wilds—to reestablish dwarven presence in the world. Not all agree.

Two factions now shape Ironhold’s future:

- **Isolationists** believe the surface is still cursed, and that Ironhold must remain sealed and self-sufficient.
- **Expansionists** believe the world is ripe for reclamation, and that dwarves must rise again as builders and rulers.

Tensions simmer. Old grudges stir. And the fate of Ironhold may rest in the hands of those willing to walk beyond the granite walls.

You are dwarves of renown—adventurers, soldiers, champions. You are not bound by politics, but you are trusted to act with strength, wisdom, and honor.

Before you choose your path, ask yourself:

- What clan do you hail from—or do you walk alone?
- What trials shaped you into a level 3 hero?
- What do you believe Ironhold should become?

The stone endures. But even stone can crack.

2. **Which clan do you quietly distrust, and why do you keep that opinion to yourself?**
3. **Which of the other two dwarves once saved your life—and what debt do you still owe them?**

---

### 🛠️ **Ramsey**

1. **What invention, tactic, or tool did you create that earned you a commendation from the king’s council?**
2. **What is your stance on Ironhold’s expansion—and which influential figure tried to sway your opinion?**
3. **Which of the other two dwarves once betrayed your trust—and how did you come to forgive (or not forgive) them?**

---

### 🧭 **Scott**

1. **What secret route, passage, or tunnel did you discover that helped evacuate a lower hall during a collapse?**
2. **Why do you believe the clanless deserve a voice in Ironhold’s future—and who opposes your view?**
3. **Which of the other two dwarves do you consider your closest ally—and what oath have you sworn to them?**

I also don't want to have any negative connections between them. I would like them to have the bond of friendly acquaintances that came up in power together. I would also like the questions to be around adventures that the characters could have been in that would help build out how they are 3rd level now.

Here’s a refined and expanded set of character background questions for your players—Jason, Ramsey, and Scott—designed to:

- Reflect their rise to 3rd level through meaningful past adventures
- Establish friendly, shared history between them
- Offer you flexibility to choose the best fit for each player

---

### 🧱 **Individual Achievement Questions** (choose 1 per player)

These help define how each dwarf earned their reputation:

- What did you do that saved Ironhold’s water supply from poison during the early days of the Flaming Retribution?
- What relic or artifact did you recover from a collapsed ruin that earned you a place in the king’s records?
- What monster did you slay in the tunnels that made your name known among the Stoneguard?
- What invention or tool did you create that is still used in Ironhold today?
- What oath did you swear to your clan that you’ve never broken?
- What secret tunnel or passage did you discover that helped evacuate a lower hall during a collapse?

---

### 🛠️ **Political or Cultural Tie-In Questions** (choose 1 per player)

These help tie the character into Ironhold’s society and current tensions:

- What is your stance on Ironhold’s expansion—and who in the court knows it?
- Why do you believe the clanless deserve a voice in Ironhold’s future?
- What clan tradition do you uphold that others have begun to abandon?
- What part of the surface world fascinates you most—and why do you keep it secret?
- What did you do during the isolation that earned you the trust of a clan not your own?

---

### 🤝 **Player Connection Questions** (choose 1 per player)

These create bonds between the characters. Each question names another player directly:

#### For Jason:

- What mission did you and **Ramsey** complete together that earned you both a commendation from the king?
- What did **Scott** do during a cave-in that saved your life—and how have you honored that moment since?

#### For Ramsey:

- What oath did you and **Jason** swear together before your first mission beyond the gates?
- What invention or tactic did you develop with **Scott** that helped defend a lower hall from collapse?

#### For Scott:

- What did you and **Ramsey** discover together in the deep tunnels that no one else has seen?
- What battle did you and **Jason** fight side by side in that forged your bond?

Absolutely! Below is a simplified version of a Foundry VTT compendium JSON file containing two roll tables: **Dwarven Achievement Questions** and **Dwarven Political Questions**. You can copy this into a `.json` file and place it in your world’s `packs` folder.

### 📁 How to Use This File

1. Copy the JSON below into a file named something like `dwarven-background-questions.db`.
2. Place it in your Foundry world’s `packs` folder:  
    `FoundryVTT/Data/worlds/<your-world-name>/packs/`
3. In your `world.json` file, add the following entry under `"packs"`:

4. Restart Foundry. You’ll see a compendium called **Dwarven Background Questions** in the sidebar.

### 🧾 JSON Content (copy into `dwarven-background-questions.db`)

Let me know if you’d like the second table (Political Questions) in the same format!

##### You said:

Please provide the Political Questions table.

###### Copilot said:

Here’s a description you can use for the **Dwarven Achievement Questions** roll table in Foundry VTT:

---

### 📜 **Description**

This roll table contains 20 unique prompts designed to help players flesh out their dwarven characters in _The Cracked Granite_ campaign. Each question reflects a notable achievement, heroic act, or formative experience that could explain how the character reached level 3. These prompts are ideal for Session 0 character creation and can be used to inspire backstory, clan reputation, or personal goals.

with all of today's information, what changes need to be made to the player's primer?

###### Copilot said:

Copilot

Based on everything we've discussed today, here are the recommended updates to your **Player Primer for The Cracked Granite**:

---

### ✅ **Changes to Make**

#### 1. **Clarify Giant Lore**

- Update the section on giants to reflect that:
    - Giants are **evil-aligned**.
    - They are **loyal to the Dark Pantheon of Erabose**, not to mortal or demi-divine figures like Vorath.
    - Their alliance with Vorath during the War of the Fractured Dawn was **strategic**, not devotional.
    - They worship **dark elemental gods** who are part of the Dark Pantheon.

#### 2. **Update Class Suggestions**

- Replace **Sorcerer** with **Kineticist**.
- Add **Gunslinger** as a common dwarven class, especially among Deepforge engineers and Ironmark scouts.

#### 3. **Revise Clan Descriptions**

- Remove the reference to Scottish clans.
- Keep the tone of tight-knit, proud, and influential.
- Avoid mentioning political alignments in the primer (e.g., loyalist, reformist, cult-aligned)—save that for GM-facing materials.

#### 4. **Add Political Structure Overview**

- Include a section describing Ironhold’s monarchy and council system.
- Introduce the two major political factions:
    - **Isolationists**: believe Ironhold should remain sealed.
    - **Expansionists**: support the king’s efforts to reclaim the surface.
- Mention the king’s efforts to send out **colonies** to reestablish dwarven presence in the world.

#### 5. **Add Session 0 Roll Table Integration**

- Mention that players will roll on two tables:
    - **Achievement Questions**: to define how they reached level 3.
    - **Political Questions**: to explore their beliefs and cultural ties.
- Let players know they’ll also answer a **bonding question** that connects them to another party member.

Would you like me to rewrite the full primer with these updates included, ready for use in Foundry or as a printable handout?

##### You said:

I don't want to include number 5. The Giants are thought to be extinct or wiped out to the point of never being able to rise to power ever again. One of the first big reveals of this adventure will be that the giants are back. the Player primer could talk about the Giant Wars in which the Dwarves wiped them from the face of Aetheria. I would like to include the political loyalties of the clans, but I only want them to be talking about the 2 factions. nothing about the main antagonist of the adventure and cults.

Thanks! Based on today’s updates, here’s a revised version of your **Player Primer for The Cracked Granite**, ready for use in Session 0:

---

## 🛡️ **The Dwarves of Aetheria: A Primer for Players**

### 🏔️ **Who Are the Dwarves of Ironhold?**

The dwarves of Ironhold are a proud, resilient people who survived the cataclysmic **Flaming Retribution** by sealing themselves deep within their mountain strongholds. While the surface world burned, they endured—by stone, steel, and stubborn will.

Now, one year later, the gates have opened.

Ironhold is a kingdom of clans. Each clan has its own traditions, strengths, and responsibilities—miners, warriors, scholars, traders, mystics, scouts. Some dwarves are born into these clans. Others walk alone, clanless but not without purpose.

---

### ⚔️ **The Giant Wars**

Centuries ago, the dwarves of Ironhold fought a brutal war against the giant tribes of the north. These towering enemies were powerful, cruel, and aligned with dark gods. The war was long and devastating, but the dwarves prevailed—driving the giants to the brink of extinction.

Today, the giants are remembered as a threat that was **wiped from the face of Aetheria**, never to rise again. Their ruins remain, but their power is believed to be broken.

---

### 🏛️ **Politics of Ironhold**

Ironhold is ruled by **King Hargrin Deepmantle**, a monarch who survived the Flaming Retribution and now seeks to rebuild the dwarven legacy. His vision is bold: to reclaim the surface and reestablish dwarven colonies across the land.

Not all dwarves agree.

Two major factions shape Ironhold’s future:

- **Isolationists** believe Ironhold should remain sealed and self-sufficient. They fear the surface is still cursed and that expansion invites ruin.
- **Expansionists** support the king’s efforts to reclaim lost lands and restore dwarven influence. They see opportunity in rebuilding and reconnecting with the world.

These factions exist across clans, families, and guilds. Some clans lean heavily toward one side, while others are divided within.

---

### 🧭 **Clans of Ironhold**

Clans are tight-knit, proud, and influential. They shape dwarven identity and politics.

- **Stoneguard** – Elite warriors and royal protectors
- **Deepforge** – Miners, engineers, and industrialists
- **Runeweaver** – Scholars, artificers, and lorekeepers
- **Hollowbrand** – Merchants, bankers, and trade brokers
- **Blackshard** – Informants, spies, and covert operatives
- **Deepshiver** – Priests, mystics, and spiritual guides
- **Ironmark** – Scouts, rangers, and border wardens

🪓 **Clanless dwarves** are rare but not unheard of. They may be orphans, exiles, or those who rejected their clan’s politics. Some see them as dangerous. Others see them as free. A clanless dwarf may be mistrusted by traditionalists but respected for their independence.

---

### 🔨 **Common Classes Among Dwarves (PF2e)**

While any class is possible, these are especially common in Ironhold:

- **Fighter** – Stoneguard warriors and clan champions
- **Cleric** – Devotees of the Forgefather or elemental patrons
- **Ranger** – Ironmark scouts and wilderness trackers
- **Inventor / Artificer** – Runeweaver engineers and tinkerers
- **Champion** – Oathbound defenders of clan and king
- **Rogue** – Blackshard agents and saboteurs
- **Gunslinger** – Deepforge marksmen and siege specialists
- **Kineticist** – Those attuned to elemental forces through the ley lines

---

### 🔥 **Who Do They Worship?**

Dwarves don’t have their own pantheon, but they revere certain gods more than others:

#### **Most Revered**

- **Durnhal, the Forgefather** – Patron of smiths and endurance
- **Gemmara, the Artisan’s Eye** – Patron of beauty and precision
- **Karnun, the Gearwright** – Patron of invention and mechanics

#### **Elemental Powers (Rank of Brilliance)**

- **Thalgrun, Lord of Flame** – Fire and transformation
- **Varnok, the Stoneheart** – Earth and endurance
- **Aelra, Mistress of Flow** – Water and temperance

---

### 🧱 **Where Do You Fit In?**

You are not novices. You are **level 3**—already tested by battle, hardship, or duty. You might be:

- A decorated soldier from the border wars
- A scout who braved the surface before the gates reopened
- A relic hunter who unearthed secrets best left buried
- A mercenary who earned a name in the underworld
- A loyal agent of the crown—or a former one

You are trusted. You are known. And now, you are being sent where others cannot go.

###### Copilot said:

Here’s a new clan you can add to the Ironhold roster to represent the industrial and mechanical heart of dwarven society:

---

### ⚙️ **Clan Geargrind**

- **Function**: Engineers, machinists, siegewrights, and industrial innovators
- **Structure**: Guild-forged hierarchy with master crafters, apprentices, and forge captains
- **Values**: Ingenuity, precision, progress, and mechanical supremacy
- **Political Alignment**: Mixed—some are Isolationists who believe Ironhold should perfect its internal systems, while others are Expansionists eager to bring dwarven engineering to the surface
- **Description**: Clan Geargrind powers the great machines of Ironhold. From siege engines to subterranean railways, their work fuels the kingdom’s infrastructure and defense. They are known for their pragmatism, their obsession with efficiency, and their rivalry with the Runeweavers over arcane vs mechanical solutions. Geargrind dwarves often wear soot-stained leathers, carry tool-laden belts, and speak in the clipped cadence of those who think faster than they talk.

The dwarves of Ironhold survived the Flaming Retribution by sealing themselves deep within their mountain halls. Now, one year later, King Hargrin Deepmantle has reopened the gates and begun sending colonies into the world to reclaim lost lands. Ironhold is ruled by clans—tight-knit, proud, and influential—and divided by two major factions: Isolationists who believe the surface is still cursed, and Expansionists who support the king’s vision of rebuilding.

I would like to write an intro for the session 1 part of the campaign. The group of 3 dwarves have been marked as heroes in the halls of Ironhold.

###### Copilot said:

Here’s a dramatic and immersive intro you can read aloud at the start of **Session 1** of _The Cracked Granite_:

---

### 🎙️ **Session 1 Introduction – The King’s Call**

> _The halls of Ironhold are never truly silent. Even in the deepest chambers, the stone remembers footsteps, whispers, and war._

You are summoned not to the throne room, but to a sealed chamber beneath it—one rarely used, and never without purpose. The guards at the door do not speak. The torches here burn low, casting long shadows across rune-carved walls.

You are not just dwarves. You are heroes—your names spoken with respect in the forges, the barracks, and the ale halls. You’ve earned that honor through deeds, not titles.

King Hargrin Deepmantle waits within, surrounded not by his full court, but by a handful of trusted advisors. His expression is grim.

He has called you here in secret, away from the eyes and ears of the council, to speak of something troubling. One of the surface colonies—**Dagger’s Sheath**—has gone silent. No messages. No scouts. No signs of life.

He will reveal more when you are all present. But one thing is already clear:

This is not a mission for soldiers.  
This is not a task for politicians.  
This is a call to those the king trusts most.

And the stone does not trust lightly.

Here’s a location description for **Ironhold**, suitable for narration, handouts, or Foundry journal entries:

---

## 🏔️ **Ironhold – The Last Great Bastion**

Carved into the heart of the Stonefang Mountains, Ironhold is more than a city—it is a fortress, a forge, and a legacy. Its halls stretch deep beneath the earth, layered like the rings of a tree, each level older and more sacred than the last. The outer gates are carved with the names of every king who has ruled since the First Age, and the inner sanctums glow with the light of rune-lanterns and molten forges.

The city is divided into clan districts, each with its own architecture, traditions, and banners. The **Deepforge** quarter hums with the sound of gears and steam. The **Runeweaver** halls are quiet, filled with libraries and arcane laboratories. The **Stoneguard** barracks echo with the clash of training weapons and the bark of drillmasters.

At the city’s heart lies the **Throne of Stone**, where King Hargrin Deepmantle rules. His court is a place of tension and tradition, where ancient oaths and modern ambitions collide.

Ironhold is a place of resilience. It withstood the Flaming Retribution. It remembers the Giant Wars. And now, its gates are open once more.

Here’s a concise description for each of the eight major dwarven clans of Ironhold, perfect for inclusion in your Ironhold document:

---

### 🛡️ **Stoneguard**

Elite warriors and royal protectors, the Stoneguard are the shield of Ironhold. Their halls echo with the clash of steel and the weight of oaths sworn in stone.

### ⛏️ **Deepforge**

Masters of mining and metallurgy, Deepforge dwarves delve deeper than any others. Their forges burn day and night, fueling Ironhold’s industry and defense.

### 📚 **Runeweaver**

Scholars, artificers, and keepers of arcane tradition, the Runeweavers preserve dwarven history and unlock the secrets of ancient runes and leyline magic.

### 💰 **Hollowbrand**

Traders, bankers, and negotiators, the Hollowbrands control Ironhold’s wealth and commerce. Their influence is felt in every deal struck and coin minted.

### 🗡️ **Blackshard**

Silent and watchful, the Blackshards deal in secrets. They serve as spies, informants, and shadow operatives—feared, respected, and rarely trusted.

### 🔮 **Deepshiver**

Mystics and spiritual guides, the Deepshivers walk the line between faith and prophecy. Their rituals are ancient, their visions often unsettling.

### 🧭 **Ironmark**

Scouts, rangers, and wilderness wardens, the Ironmarks are Ironhold’s eyes beyond the stone. They know the surface better than most and guard the mountain’s edges.

### ⚙️ **Geargrind**

Engineers, machinists, and siegewrights, the Geargrinds build the machines that keep Ironhold running. Their minds are as sharp as their tools, and their halls hum with invention.

Here’s a write-up on the **dwarves of Aetheria**, suitable for inclusion in your Ironhold document or as a player-facing lore entry:

---

## 🛡️ **The Dwarves of Aetheria**

The dwarves of Aetheria are a proud, enduring people shaped by stone, fire, and tradition. Their civilization is ancient, rooted in the deep places of the world, and defined by resilience in the face of catastrophe. When the Flaming Retribution scorched the surface, the dwarves of Ironhold sealed their gates and survived—alone, but unbroken.

Dwarven society is structured around powerful clans, each with its own function, traditions, and political influence. These clans are tight-knit and proud, with loyalties that span generations. Some are warriors, others scholars, engineers, merchants, mystics, or scouts. A rare few walk without clan, either by choice or exile, and are viewed with a mix of suspicion and respect.

Politically, the dwarves are divided between two major factions:

- **Isolationists**, who believe Ironhold should remain sealed and self-sufficient.
- **Expansionists**, who support King Hargrin Deepmantle’s vision of reclaiming the surface and rebuilding dwarven influence.

Though the dwarves are deeply spiritual, they do not worship a unique pantheon. Instead, they revere select gods from the broader divine orders—especially those tied to craftsmanship, endurance, and elemental mastery. Their most honored deities include:

- **Durnhal, the Forgefather**
- **Gemmara, the Artisan’s Eye**
- **Karnun, the Gearwright**
- **Thalgrun, Lord of Flame**
- **Varnok, the Stoneheart**
- **Aelra, Mistress of Flow**

The dwarves also remember the **Giant Wars**, a brutal conflict in which they drove the giant tribes to the brink of extinction. Though the giants once allied with the Dark Pantheon, the dwarves believe their threat has long since passed.

Now, with the gates of Ironhold open once more, the dwarves stand at a crossroads—between tradition and ambition, isolation and expansion, memory and legacy.

The file doesn’t contain a dedicated section on the Giant Wars, so here’s a custom write-up based on your worldbuilding and previous notes:

---

## ⚔️ **The Giant Wars**

The Giant Wars were a defining conflict in dwarven history—an era of blood, stone, and survival. Long before the Flaming Retribution, the dwarves of Ironhold faced a rising threat from the giant tribes of the north. These towering beings, forged in elemental fury and loyal to the Dark Pantheon of Erabose, sought dominion over the surface and the deep places of the world.

The giants were not mindless brutes. They were organized, tribal, and devout—worshiping cruel elemental gods and wielding magic that twisted the land itself. Though they allied with Vorath during the War of the Fractured Dawn, their loyalty was never to him. They served only their gods and their own vision of conquest.

The war was long and brutal. Entire dwarven holds were shattered. Mountains burned. Rivers froze. But the dwarves endured. Through unity, sacrifice, and unmatched craftsmanship, they drove the giants to the brink of extinction.

By the end of the Third Age, the giants were believed to be wiped from the face of Aetheria—scattered, broken, and buried beneath the ruins of their own ambition.

Their temples are silent. Their bones are dust.  
Or so the dwarves believe.

Session 00 1.md What updates do I need to make to the adventure considering the player choices that were made in session 0?

###### Copilot said:

Copilot

Based on the content of your Session 0 transcript, here are the key player choices and themes that should influence updates to your adventure:

---

### ✅ **Player Choices & Themes Identified**

1. **All Players Are Dwarves**
    
    - The party is fully committed to the dwarven cultural identity. This reinforces the importance of clan dynamics, dwarven traditions, and Ironhold politics.
2. **Characters Are Level 3 and Known in Ironhold**
    
    - The players are recognized as heroes or figures of renown. This should be reflected in how NPCs treat them—respect, deference, or political interest.
3. **Class Choices**
    
    - The party includes a **ranger**, a **kineticist**, and a **gunslinger**.
    - These classes suggest a mix of ranged combat, elemental manipulation, and tactical versatility. Encounters should allow for mobility, environmental interaction, and ranged threats.
4. **Tone Preference**
    
    - Players are interested in exploration, discovery, and political intrigue.
    - They’re open to character flexibility and narrative-driven development.
5. **Factional Awareness**
    
    - Players are aware of the **Isolationist vs. Expansionist** divide and are encouraged to align with or against it.
    - Some players expressed interest in being Expansionist or neutral.
6. **Clans Are Chosen Individually**
    
    - Players are from different clans and have worked together before, but are not necessarily a formal team at the start of the adventure.

---

### 🛠️ **Recommended Adventure Updates**

#### 1. **NPC Reactions**

- Have NPCs recognize the party’s past deeds. Use titles, nods of respect, or subtle political interest.
- Example: “Ah, the heroes of the Lower Hall Collapse. The king chooses well.”

#### 2. **Opening Scene Adjustments**

- Emphasize the secrecy and importance of the king’s summons.
- Include subtle tension between Isolationist and Expansionist advisors in the room.
- Let the king reference the party’s past accomplishments when asking for their help.

#### 3. **Factional Hooks**

- Introduce early opportunities for players to interact with both factions.
- Example: A loyalist NPC offers support, while an Isolationist warns them not to stir trouble.

#### 4. **Exploration-Focused Encounters**

- Design early encounters to reward scouting, tracking, and environmental awareness.
- Include terrain that benefits ranged and mobile characters (e.g., cliffs, ruins, unstable ground).

#### 5. **Clans in Play**

- Introduce clan-specific NPCs or rivalries that reflect the players’ backgrounds.
- Let players’ clan affiliations open or close doors politically or socially.

#### 6. **Session 1 Setup**

- Begin with the king’s secret meeting (as already planned).
- Let the players ask questions or offer insight based on their past experiences.
- End the session with the journey to Dagger’s Sheath or the first signs of something being wrong.

###### Copilot said:

Here’s a boxed text introduction you can read aloud at the start of **Session 1** of _The Cracked Granite_, tailored to reflect the players’ status as heroes, the political climate, and the king’s secretive summons:

---

### 📜 **Boxed Text – Session 1: The King’s Call**

> _The summons came without fanfare—no trumpets, no banners, no public audience. Just a sealed scroll, a royal seal, and a time._

You are led through the quieter halls of Ironhold, past the forges and council chambers, into a part of the mountain few ever see. The stone here is older, darker, carved with runes that predate the current age. Guards stand silent at the door, their armor marked not with clan sigils, but the king’s personal crest.

Inside, the chamber is dimly lit by rune-lanterns. A long stone table dominates the room. At its head stands **King Hargrin Deepmantle**, his expression carved from the same granite as the walls around him.

He does not rise. He does not smile.

> “You are not here as soldiers. You are not here as emissaries. You are here because I trust you—and because I cannot trust the court.”

He gestures to the table, where a map is unrolled. One location is circled in red ink: **Dagger’s Sheath**, a dwarven colony sent to the surface months ago.

> “They were to send word every fortnight. It has been six. No message. No scout. No sign.”

He looks each of you in the eye.

> “I need answers. Quietly. Before the court starts asking questions I cannot answer.”

Here’s a follow-up scene you can use immediately after the king’s secret briefing, as the players begin their journey to Dagger’s Sheath:

---

### 🛤️ **Boxed Text – Journey to Dagger’s Sheath**

> _The king’s words still echo in your minds as you leave the chamber—quiet, urgent, heavy with unspoken fear._

You are given no escort, no fanfare. Just a sealed writ bearing the king’s mark, a map with a red circle, and the weight of trust few dwarves ever earn.

The path to Dagger’s Sheath winds through the upper tunnels of Ironhold, then out into the open air—your first taste of the surface in months, maybe years. The sky is gray. The wind is sharp. The mountains stretch like broken teeth across the horizon.

The colony lies a week’s march to the northwest, nestled in a high valley once rich with ore. It was meant to be a symbol of dwarven resurgence. A foothold. A promise.

Now, it is silent.

And you are the only ones being sent to find out why.

---

Would you like help building stat blocks for the ambush creatures or a map layout for Dagger’s Sheath?

##### You said:

I would like to figure out how the ambush creatures might be related to the Giants. Are they not supposed to be?

###### Copilot said:

Copilot

Great question. In _The Cracked Granite_, the ambush creatures in Session 1 can absolutely be **connected to the giants**, but not in a direct or obvious way—especially since the giants are believed to be extinct. Here’s how you can structure that connection to preserve the mystery and foreshadow their return:

---

## 🧩 **How the Ambush Creatures Connect to the Giants**

### 🧬 **Corrupted Wildlife or Elemental Remnants**

- The creatures could be **native beasts** (e.g., wolves, mountain drakes, or cave stalkers) that have been **twisted by residual giant magic** or **elemental corruption**.
- Their bodies bear **faint rune scars**, **unusual mutations**, or **behavioral anomalies**—signs of exposure to ancient giant rituals or leyline tampering.

### 🪨 **Signs of Giant Influence**

- The creatures may be drawn to **giant-marked ruins**, corrupted leyline nodes, or **stonework bearing giant runes**.
- They might be **guarding** or **nesting near** a site that was once sacred to the giants.

### 🧠 **Player Discovery Hooks**

- Arcana or Religion checks could reveal that the runes on the creatures are **not dwarven**, and match **old war records** from the Giant Wars.
- Survival or Nature checks might show that the creatures are **not behaving naturally**—they’re being influenced or controlled by something deeper.

---

## ⚔️ **Encounter Example**

- **Creatures**: 2 corrupted mountain wolves + 1 elemental shardling (a small earth elemental with jagged, rune-etched stone skin)
- **Environment**: Collapsing ruins, unstable leyline energy, faint giant runes glowing in the stone
- **Clue**: After the fight, the party finds a **fragment of a giant rune** embedded in the shardling’s core—matching symbols from the Giant Wars.

---

Would you like help statting out these creatures or creating a handout for the rune fragment they find?

## Character Summaries

### Demlor, Dwarven Kineticist Investigator

![[Demlor Portrait.jpg]]

#### Hunter of Orcs

- **Male dwarf, mid-20s to 30s (human equivalent), stocky, average height**

- **Long, braided hair and beard (multiple braids)**

- **Grey, cold iron-like eyes with eagle-talon slash tattoos/scars around the eyes**

- **Ruddy skin**

- **Carapace armor (orc origin, insect-like details), Gate Attenuator amulet, clan dagger at belt, wrist-mounted grappling gun**

- **No weapons in hand—he is his own weapon**

- **Metal kineticist: subtle metallic glints, maybe hints of iron or steel in accessories**

- **Thrill-seeker expression, confident and alert**

- **Mountainous or underdark-inspired background, but focus on the character**

##### Background (Narrative)

Demlor’s legend began in the shadowed heights of Ironhold, born with the elemental heart of a mountain—cold, unyielding, and restless. His powers as a kineticist manifested early, the iron in his blood resonating with the deep pulse of the earth. Metal bent to his will, and his presence drew the chill of the high peaks wherever he went.  

Demlor’s reputation as an orc hunter was forged in the tunnels of the Underdark. He became infamous among the orc tribes for his relentless pursuit and the cold efficiency with which he dispatched his foes—never with a blade, but with the very metal of the earth itself.  

But Demlor is more than a weapon. His keen mind and investigative instincts have solved mysteries that baffled even the king’s agents. His thrill-seeking nature drives him to the edge of danger, but his loyalty to Ironhold and his hatred of orc-kind keep him grounded.

---

### Hurgan, Dwarven Ranger

![[Hurgan Portrait.jpg]]

#### Night Watch Sentinel

- **Male dwarf, mid-30s (human equivalent), powerful build**

- **Wild, practical hair and beard (windblown, streaked with light color)**

- **Warm, intense eyes; tanned, weathered skin**

- **Medium hardshell surki carapace armor (distinct, rugged, and rune-etched)**

- **Dual-wields a dwarven war axe and a warhammer—both always at hand**

- **Clan dagger at his belt, geometric frostwalker tattoo visible on forearm or neck**

- **Sign of sigils among his gear**

- **Vigilant, alert expression—always scanning the horizon**

- **Background: Born to the Night Watch, Hurgan is a sentinel of the overland mountains near Ironhold. He’s known for his endurance, resistance to poison, and his uncanny ability to spot danger in the dark.**

- **Setting: Often depicted against a windswept mountain pass at dusk or dawn, ready to defend his kin from whatever shambles in the night**

##### Background (Narrative)

Hurgan’s story is carved into the wind-scoured peaks above Ironhold, where the sky is sharp and the nights are long. Born to the Night Watch, he learned vigilance before he learned to speak—his earliest memories are of standing guard while others slept, eyes fixed on the shifting shadows beyond the firelight.  

Hurgan’s reputation as a ranger was forged in the high passes and deep forests, where he became a master of survival and a relentless hunter of threats to his people. His wild, practical hair and beard are as much a part of his legend as the frostwalker tattoos that wind across his skin, marking him as one who fears neither cold nor darkness.  

But Hurgan is more than a sentinel. His warm, intense eyes miss nothing, and his loyalty to Ironhold is matched only by his sense of duty to those who cannot defend themselves. He has uncovered secret tunnels during cave-ins, led evacuations through blizzards, and stood alone against horrors that shambled in the night. Among the clans, he is respected as a guardian and a guide—one who knows the land, the sky, and the silent language of danger.

---

## Factions of Ironhold

### ⚒️ Isolationists

**Belief:** Ironhold’s survival depends on secrecy, caution, and self-sufficiency. The surface world remains cursed and dangerous after the Flaming Retribution, and opening the gates invites ruin. The traditions of the ancestors, the strength of the stone, and the safety of the clan come before all else.

**Supporters:**  

- Traditionalist clan elders  

- Many Stoneguard veterans  

- Some Deepforge miners and Deepshiver mystics  

- Dwarves who lost kin or faith during the cataclysm

**Methods:**  

Isolationists resist change, expansion, and outside influence. They focus on perfecting Ironhold’s defenses, maintaining ancient rituals, and stockpiling resources. They are wary of outsiders and suspicious of new ideas.

**Typical Saying:**  

“The stone endures. Let the world outside crumble.”

---

### 🛡️ Expansionists

**Belief:**  

Expansionists believe the time has come for Ironhold to reclaim its place in the world. The surface is no longer a death sentence, but an opportunity. They support the king’s vision of rebuilding, sending out colonies, reopening trade, and forging new alliances. Progress, innovation, and bold action are their watchwords.

**Supporters:**  

- King Hargrin Deepmantle  

- Younger dwarves and ambitious clan leaders  

- Most Runeweavers, Geargrinds, and Ironmarks  

- Many Hollowbrand traders and reform-minded Deepforge engineers

**Methods:**  

Expansionists champion exploration, diplomacy, and technological advancement. They encourage dwarves to look outward, learn from the past, and build a new legacy.

**Typical Saying:**  

“The stone endures, but it is time to build anew.”

---

### 🏰 Loyalists

**Belief:**  

Loyalists are those who support the king and the royal line above all else. While many are Expansionists, some are Isolationists who believe only the king can keep Ironhold safe. Loyalty, honor, and unity are their guiding principles.

**Supporters:**  

- Bramli Stoneguard (Captain of the Guard)  

- Baelgrin Deepdelve (High Loremaster)  

- Thorek Ironbrow (Royal Blacksmith)  

- Many Stoneguard and Runeweaver elders

**Methods:**  

Loyalists work to maintain order, uphold the king’s decrees, and mediate between the other factions. They often serve as the backbone of Ironhold’s defense and tradition.

**Typical Saying:**  

“The king is the heart of the mountain.”

---

### 🕵️ Reformists

**Belief:**  

Reformists seek to modernize Ironhold’s economy, reduce royal control, and empower the clans and guilds. They are pragmatic, opportunistic, and often driven by profit or innovation.

**Supporters:**  

- Many Hollowbrand merchants  

- Ambitious Deepforge and Geargrind leaders  

- Some Blackshard informants

**Methods:**  

Reformists push for new laws, open markets, and greater clan autonomy. They are skilled negotiators and often act as kingmakers behind the scenes.

**Typical Saying:**  

“Stone is strong, but gold is stronger.”

---

### 🕯️ Radicals & Cults

**Belief:**  

Radicals and cultists believe Ironhold must embrace forbidden power or ancient rights to survive. Some seek to awaken old gods, others to overthrow the king or destroy the clans’ grip on society.

**Supporters:**  

- The Hollowed Flame cult (Deepshiver radicals)  

- Disaffected or exiled dwarves  

- Secretive Blackshard agents

**Methods:**  

Radicals operate in the shadows, using sabotage, dark rituals, and manipulation. They are feared and hunted by the other factions.

**Typical Saying:**  

“Let the old order burn. From the ashes, we rise.”

---

## Session 1 Encounter Recommendations

**Best Option:** 2 Ogres and an Azer  

- Introduces elemental themes early (Azer = fire elemental dwarf)  

- Memorable, varied fight (brutes + fire dwarf)  

- Sets up future encounters with more powerful elementals or corrupted creatures  

- Azer’s presence can be explained as a mercenary, summoned ally, or a sign the giants are experimenting with elemental magic

**Alternative:** 2 Ogres and a Cinder Rat (easier, more subtle elemental hint)  

**Avoid:** 3 Ogres (hardest, no elemental flavor)

---

## Clarifications on Elemental/Giant Themes

- Giants are believed extinct; their return is a major reveal.

- Elemental creatures (like Azers) are a sign of new, unnatural alliances or magic at work.

- The party’s first encounter should hint at these changes without revealing the full threat.

### **Scene 1: The Secret Council**

**Purpose:**  
Set the tone, introduce the political landscape, and give the party their mission.

**Boxed Text (Read Aloud):**

> Deep in the heart of the Northern [[Stonefang Mountains]], in the fortress of [[Ironhold]], you a champion amoung the dwarves, have been summoned...
>
> The summons comes quietly—no fanfare, no banners, just a sealed scroll and a time. You are led through the quieter halls of [[Ironhold]], past forges and council chambers, into a part of the mountain few ever see. The stone here is older, darker, carved with runes that predate the current age.
> 
> In a private chamber, [[King Hargrin Deepmantle]] waits, surrounded by a handful of trusted advisors. His expression is grim.

**NPCs Present:**

- [[King Hargrin Deepmantle]] (quest giver, cautious, respected)
- [[Baelgrin Deepdelve]] (quiet scholar, hints at ancient threats)
- [[Bramli Stoneguard]] (loyal captain, wary of political corruption)
- [[Varric Silvervein]] (ambitious, subtly undermining)
- [[Maela Blackshard]] (spy, manipulator)

- Dagger's Sheath - A Dwarven Colony to the south of the [[Stonefang Mountains]]
	- Appears to have gone silent
	- Not sure what has happened, but don't want to cause alarm. It is hard enough to work with the [[Ironhold - Isolationists]] when things are going well.
-  Investigate what happened. Maybe they are just so busy that they lost track of time...

**Roleplay Tips:**

- Let each advisor give a brief, in-character comment or question.
- Varric and Maela should subtly sow doubt (“Perhaps the colony simply failed, my king. Why risk more lives?”).
- Loyalists (Bramli, Baelgrin) support the king and encourage action.
- Allow players to ask questions, share their past deeds, or express their views.

**Skill Checks:**

- **Society or Diplomacy**: Read the room, sense political tension.
- **Perception**: Notice Maela’s subtle manipulations or Kelda’s cryptic glances.
- **Lore (Ironhold)**: Recall details about Dagger’s Sheath or the political climate.

### **Scene 2: Arrival at Dagger’s Sheath**

**Purpose:**  
Transition to exploration and investigation, set a somber, mysterious tone.

**Boxed Text (Read Aloud):**

> After a week and a half of travel through mountain passes and silent valleys, you crest the final ridge. Below, the colony of Dagger’s Sheath lies in ruins—buildings shattered, stonework scorched, and no signs of life. The air is thick with ash and silence. The only sounds are the wind and the creak of broken timber.

**What the PCs Find:**

- No survivors, only wreckage and eerie silence.
- Giant-sized footprints in the mud and dust.
- Defaced dwarven banners, a broken royal seal, and strange runes burned into the earth.
- Evidence of a siege: collapsed barricades, shattered weapons, scorch marks.

**Exploration/Skill Challenges:**

- **Survival**: Track movement, identify giant footprints.
- **Arcana or Religion**: Interpret corrupted runes.
- **Perception**: Spot hidden clues (e.g., a half-buried message tube, signs of ritual activity).
- **Crafting or Engineering**: Assess how the defenses failed.

**Roleplay/Creative Hooks:**

- Let the creative/roleplay-focused player describe how their character investigates or memorializes the dead.
- The exploration-focused player can find a hidden clue or secret passage.
- The combat-focused player may notice signs of a recent struggle or prepare for danger.

### **Scene 3: There Was a Fire Fight!!!**

**Purpose:**  
Deliver a tense, dynamic combat encounter with environmental hazards and a chance for tactical/creative play.

**Boxed Text (Read Aloud):**

> As you sift through the ruins, a faint sound echoes from the direction of the mines—voices, guttural and harsh, not dwarven. Suddenly, the ground trembles. 
 

> You see two hulking ogres emerge, their skin marked with crude runes. Between them, an odd, orange-glowing dwarf-like creature—its eyes burning with elemental fire. They appear to be having a headed debate.


**Combat Encounter:**

- **Enemies:** 2 Ogres (brutes), 1 Azer (fire dwarf elemental)
- **Tactics:** Ogres charge and smash, Azer uses fire bursts and tries to set the terrain alight.
- **Environmental Hazards:**
    - Burning rubble (entering or ending turn = 1d6 fire damage, DC 15 Reflex to avoid)
    - Unstable ground (Acrobatics or Reflex save to avoid falling prone)
    - Collapsing structures (triggered by missed attacks or area effects)

**Skill/Creative Opportunities:**

- **Athletics**: Climb rubble for high ground.
- **Nature/Arcana**: Identify the Azer and its weaknesses.
- **Crafting**: Use debris as improvised cover or weapons.
- **Roleplay**: Shout warnings, rally allies, or try to intimidate the ogres.

**Optional Discovery:**

- During or after the fight, the party finds **Captain Kaela Ironmark** hiding, wounded but alive. She can give tactical insight (“They knew our defenses. Someone told them how to break us.”) and hint at betrayal.

### **Session Pacing & Player Engagement**

- **Roleplay:** Scene 1 (council) and Kaela’s rescue.
- **Exploration:** Scene 2 (ruins investigation).
- **Combat:** Scene 3 (ogres + Azer, with hazards).

**Tips:**

- Let each player shine in their preferred style at least once.
- Use boxed text to set the mood, then open up for player-driven action.
- If time is tight, keep the investigation focused and the combat brisk—use environmental hazards to add tension without dragging out the fight.
