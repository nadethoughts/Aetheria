## 🛡️ **Session 0 Introduction – The Cracked Granite**

When the Flaming Retribution scorched the surface world, the dwarves did not burn. They sealed their gates, reinforced their halls, and endured. For a year, Ironhold remained silent—its people surviving by stone, steel, and stubborn will.

Now, the gates have opened.

Ironhold is a kingdom of clans. Each clan has its own traditions, its own strengths—miners, warriors, scholars, traders, mystics, scouts. Some dwarves are born into these clans. Others walk alone, clanless but not without purpose.

The king, Hargrin Deepmantle, believes the time has come to reclaim the surface. He has sent out colonies—small footholds in the wilds—to reestablish dwarven presence in the world. Not all agree.

Two factions now shape Ironhold’s future:

- **Isolationists** believe the surface is still cursed, and that Ironhold must remain sealed and self-sufficient.
- **Expansionists** believe the world is ripe for reclamation, and that dwarves must rise again as builders and rulers.

Tensions simmer. Old grudges stir. And the fate of Ironhold may rest in the hands of those willing to walk beyond the granite walls.

You are dwarves of renown—adventurers, soldiers, champions. You are not bound by politics, but you are trusted to act with strength, wisdom, and honor.

Before you choose your path, ask yourself:

- What clan do you hail from—or do you walk alone?
- What do you believe Ironhold should become?

The stone endures. But even stone can crack.
