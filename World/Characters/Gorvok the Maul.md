## 🪓 Gorvok the Maul – Breaker of Dagger’s Sheath

- **Race**: Ogre
- **Gender**: Male
- **Alignment**: Chaotic Evil
- **Role**: Warband Enforcer, Frontline Commander
- **Faction**: Serves Grondar Earthcaller and the resurgent giants

### 🧱 Background

Gorvok was born into the brutal hierarchy of the Fire Walker Tribe, a monstrous faction known for its devotion to destruction and its servitude to dark elemental forces. As a young ogre, Gorvok was used as a pit fighter and shock trooper, surviving by sheer brutality and cunning. His rise through the ranks was marked by bloodshed, betrayal, and the ritual slaying of his own war-chief.

When Grondar Earthcaller began assembling his warbands in the wake of the Flaming Retribution, Gorvok was among the first to answer the call. He saw in Grondar not just a leader, but a godlike figure who promised him endless war and the chance to carve his name into the bones of the world. Gorvok was given command of the first strike force and led the assault that annihilated Dagger’s Sheath.

### 🎯 Ambition

To become the most feared warlord of the new age and to earn a place at Grondar’s side as his chosen executioner.

### 🔥 Motivation

Gorvok is driven by rage, pride, and a deep hatred for civilization. He sees dwarves as weaklings hiding behind stone and tradition. Every ruin he leaves behind is a monument to his strength. He wears pieces of dwarven armor as trophies and paints his maul with the blood of fallen defenders.

### 🧩 Adventure Hooks

- The party may find his war banner or personal sigil among the wreckage of Dagger’s Sheath.
- Survivors or scouts may describe him in fearful whispers, building him up as a monstrous legend.
- He could serve as a mid-campaign boss fight or return later, stronger and more brutal, for a climactic rematch.
