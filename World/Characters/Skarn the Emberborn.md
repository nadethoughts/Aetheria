## 🔥 Skarn the Emberborn – Voice of the Flame

- **Race**: Elemental (Fire-infused)
- **Gender**: Male (masculine-coded)
- **Alignment**: Neutral Evil
- **Role**: Elemental Servitor, Ritualist, Warband Support
- **Faction**: Serves Grondar Earthcaller and the elemental cause

### 🧱 Background

Skarn was not born—he was **forged**. During the early resurgence of the giants, Grondar Earthcaller performed a ritual deep within a leyline chamber corrupted by the Flaming Retribution. The ritual called upon the elemental forces of fire and stone to create a living weapon. From the molten core of the mountain, Skarn emerged—a being of flame and fury, bound by runes and purpose.

Though he speaks little, Skarn is known to chant in ancient tongues during battle, invoking forgotten elemental names and prophecies. He believes the world must be **cleansed**—burned down to its bones so that a new age may rise. He sees the giants as the rightful stewards of this rebirth and serves Grondar with unwavering devotion.

### 🎯 Ambition

To awaken the elemental heart of the mountains and bring about a new age of fire and stone.

### 🔥 Motivation

Skarn is driven by **fanaticism** and **elemental instinct**. He views dwarves as parasites who have mined too deep and too greedily, disturbing the balance of the world. His magic is not just destructive—it is **ritualistic**, meant to reshape the land and purge the old order.

### 🧩 Adventure Hooks

- His runes may match those found in corrupted dwarven relics, hinting at Varric’s involvement.
- He could be encountered performing a ritual to awaken a dormant elemental guardian.
- If defeated, his essence may linger, corrupting the land or whispering through flame.
