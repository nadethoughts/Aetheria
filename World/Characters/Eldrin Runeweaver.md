## 📚 Eldrin Runeweaver – Scholar of the Deep Runes

- **Race**: Dwarf
- **Gender**: Male
- **Alignment**: Neutral Good
- **Role**: Artificer, Historian, Keeper of Forbidden Lore
- **Faction**: Loyal to King Hargrin Deepmantle

### 🧱 Background

Eldrin Runeweaver was once a professor of arcane theory at the Arcane Academy in Lumopolis before it was destroyed in the Flaming Retribution. He survived by sheer luck—on sabbatical in Ironhold, researching dwarven rune traditions when the cataclysm struck. Since then, he has remained in Ironhold, dedicating himself to preserving what knowledge remains and uncovering the secrets buried beneath the mountains.

Eldrin is one of the few dwarves who understands the ancient leyline networks and the resonance of the Llano. He has grown increasingly concerned by the resurgence of elemental disturbances and the appearance of hybrid runes—dwarven in form, but giant in origin.

### 🎯 Ambition

To recover and protect the lost magical heritage of the dwarves and prevent it from being twisted by those who seek power.

### 🔥 Motivation

Eldrin is driven by a deep reverence for knowledge and a fear of history repeating itself. He sees Varric’s rise and the warband’s rune-marked weapons as signs of a deeper corruption. Though not a warrior, he is willing to risk everything to ensure the truth is not buried again.

### 🧩 Adventure Hooks

- May provide the party with magical insight or rune-based tools.
- Could be the first to recognize the signs of a dwarven-giant magical fusion.
- Might be targeted by the Hollowed Flame for knowing too much.
