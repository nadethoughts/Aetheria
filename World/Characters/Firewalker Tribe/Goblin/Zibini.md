A Monk of the Firewalker Tribe and servant of Vorath.
## Description
 - **Skin and Pattern:** The goblin’s skin is a deep, volcanic green, etched with ember-red fissures that trace across the arms, chest, and neck like glowing cracks in cooled lava. These fiery lines pulse faintly, emphasizing the monk’s elemental connection and inner discipline.    
- **Attire:** Unlike the heavy armor of warriors, the monk wears minimal protective gear for agility. A sleeveless, charred leather tunic wraps tightly around the torso, reinforced with soot-stained cloth strips. The lower body is covered by loose, tattered trousers bound at the ankles with scorched wraps, allowing freedom of movement. A crimson sash cinches the waist, its frayed ends trailing like tongues of flame.    
- **Accessories and Details:** The monk’s forearms and shins are wrapped in thick, blackened cloth, scorched at the edges, with faint rune-like markings burned into the fabric. Around the neck hangs a simple cord strung with volcanic beads, each glowing faintly as if infused with heat. The goblin’s posture is taut and balanced, radiating readiness for sudden strikes.    
- **Weapons and Gear:** True to monk tradition, the goblin favors unarmed combat but carries a pair of short, jagged knuckle spikes forged from dark iron, their edges glowing faintly red. A small satchel at the hip holds powdered ash and ember charms—tools for ritual focus or elemental techniques.    
- **Overall Impression:** This Firewalker Monk embodies controlled ferocity: a warrior who channels volcanic energy through disciplined strikes. The glowing cracks across the skin, the scorched wrappings, and the ember-hued accents all reinforce the tribe’s fiery, earthbound aesthetic while highlighting the monk’s speed and precision.
