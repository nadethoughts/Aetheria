Firewalker witch
![[Minargul.png|300]]
## Description
- **Skin and Pattern:** The goblin’s skin is a deep, earthy green, marred by jagged fissures glowing ember-red, like volcanic cracks across the arms, neck, and chest. These fiery lines pulse faintly, suggesting a connection to elemental magic.    
- **Attire:** The witch wears a patchwork robe of scorched leather and charred cloth, layered with tattered strips that hang unevenly. The robe is adorned with dangling charms—bone fragments, shards of obsidian, and small pouches filled with ritual powders. A crimson sash wraps around the waist, frayed at the edges, and a hood drapes loosely over the head, shadowing the upper features.    
- **Accessories and Details:** Around the neck hangs a necklace of jagged teeth and glowing stones, each etched with runes. The arms are wrapped in soot-stained bandages, and the fingers are tipped with claw-like nails blackened as if burned. One shoulder bears a spiked pauldron, cracked and rusted, while the other is bare, revealing the glowing fissures beneath.    
- **Weapon and Focus:** In one hand, the witch grips a crooked staff made of blackened wood, capped with a shard of volcanic glass that flickers with inner fire. The staff is wrapped in red cords and dangling fetishes—tiny skulls and ember-like beads. Wisps of smoke curl from the top, giving the impression of smoldering magic.    
- **Overall Impression:** The goblin witch exudes an aura of primal fire and forbidden knowledge, blending tribal savagery with volcanic mysticism. Every detail—from the cracked skin to the scorched garments—reinforces the Firewalker tribe’s theme of heat, ash, and destructive magic.
