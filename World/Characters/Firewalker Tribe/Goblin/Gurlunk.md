Ranger of the Firewalker Tribe.

## Description
- **Skin and Pattern:** The goblin’s skin is a rugged volcanic green, streaked with ember-red fissures that resemble cracked earth glowing from within. These fiery lines run across the arms, neck, and partially exposed chest, pulsing faintly like molten veins.    
- **Armor and Clothing:** The ranger wears a mix of hardened leather and scorched cloth, optimized for mobility and stealth. A dark, weathered leather cuirass covers the torso, reinforced with metal plates that bear heat-warped cracks and rust. A deep crimson scarf wraps around the neck and shoulders, its edges frayed and blackened as if singed by flame. The lower body is clad in flexible, soot-stained trousers, bound at the calves with charred wraps for silent movement.    
- **Accessories and Details:** Across the ranger’s chest is a bandolier holding small pouches and ember-tipped arrows. A quiver slung over the back carries jagged, blackened shafts fletched with crimson feathers. The forearms are wrapped in scorched cloth strips, and the hands grip weapons with claw-like nails that appear hardened by heat. A belt with a large, cracked buckle secures additional gear, including a small satchel for traps and survival tools.    
- **Weapons and Gear:** The ranger wields a longbow crafted from dark, heat-treated wood, its limbs etched with glowing runes that shimmer faintly like embers. The bowstring appears taut and reinforced, suggesting both durability and power. A jagged short blade hangs at the hip, forged from volcanic metal with a serrated edge for brutal close combat.    
- **Overall Impression:** This Firewalker Ranger embodies lethal precision and fiery resilience. Every detail—from the ember-cracked skin to the scorched leather and rune-marked bow—reflects the tribe’s volcanic heritage and the ranger’s role as a relentless hunter in the burning wilds.
