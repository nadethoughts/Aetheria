---
### 🧑‍🎓 Background
Korrak Flintshard was born in the deep caverns beneath the Shattered Peaks, raised among the remnants of a once-proud stone giant clan. Marked by a prophecy carved into the cavern walls—“The hammer shall rise when the mountain breaks”—he interpreted the Flaming Retribution as his sign to act. When Grondar Earthcaller called the giants to war, Korrak pledged his strength and loyalty, becoming one of Grondar’s most trusted generals. He believes in the old ways: strength, endurance, and the right of giants to rule the mountains. To him, dwarves are parasites who hollow out the bones of the world and must be driven out.

### 🏰 Current Status (Post-Cracked Granite)
- **Named Giant General:** Korrak’s name was revealed during the final act of The Cracked Granite when Baelgrin Deepdelve deciphered ancient runes on a battle map. These runes identified Korrak Flintshard as one of the two primary leaders of the giant resurgence, alongside Grondar Earthcaller.
- **Unseen but Influential:** Korrak did not appear directly in any encounters during the campaign, but his influence looms large. He is believed to command major warbands and oversee elemental rituals that empower the giants and their thralls.
- **Future Threat:** With Grondar regrouping in the north, Korrak is expected to lead assaults or defend leyline sanctums in the coming war. His absence from the southern front suggests he is being reserved for critical operations or a major offensive against Ironhold.
- **Symbol of Retribution:** Among the giants, Korrak is revered as the “Hammer of the Deep,” a living embodiment of the prophecy that foretold the giants’ return.

### 🎯 Ambition
To become the warlord of the surface once the dwarves are defeated and restore the ancient dominion of the stone giants.

---
### 🔥 Motivation
Korrak is driven by prophecy, pride, and a deep hatred for the dwarves who desecrated his ancestors’ sacred halls. He sees himself as the hammer of retribution, chosen to break the dwarves and reclaim the mountains.

### 🧩 Adventure Hooks

- Capturing or defeating Korrak could reveal Grondar’s ultimate plans and the giants’ strategy.
- He may serve as a climactic boss fight or recurring antagonist in the next arc.
