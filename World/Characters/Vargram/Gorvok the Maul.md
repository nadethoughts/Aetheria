**Race:** Ogre  
**Gender:** Male  
**Alignment:** Chaotic Evil  
**Role:** Warband Enforcer, Frontline Commander  
**Faction:** Serves Grondar Earthcaller and the resurgent giants

### 🧑‍🎓 Background
Gorvok was born into the brutal hierarchy of the Fire Walker Tribe, a monstrous faction devoted to destruction and servitude to dark elemental forces. As a young ogre, he survived pit fighting and shock trooper duties by sheer brutality and cunning, rising through the ranks by bloodshed and betrayal. When Grondar Earthcaller began assembling his warbands after the Flaming Retribution, Gorvok was among the first to answer the call. He was given command of the first strike force and led the assault that annihilated Dagger’s Sheath, cementing his reputation as a terror of the new age.

### 🏰 Current Status (Post-Cracked Granite)
- **Survived the Battle of Dagger’s Sheath:** Gorvok led the initial attack on Dagger’s Sheath, leaving devastation and death in his wake. He was present in the mines and later at the ogre war camp, but was not slain by the party during their infiltration and rescue operations. 
- **Command Tent Presence:** During the party’s infiltration of the ogre camp, Gorvok was identified as the warband enforcer left behind in the command tent. He was not directly confronted or killed by the heroes at this stage, and his fate remains unresolved.
- **Ongoing Threat:** Gorvok remains at large, likely regrouping with other giant-aligned forces. His survival means he could return as a recurring antagonist, either seeking revenge or continuing his campaign of terror against the dwarves.
- **Symbol of Brutality:** Survivors and scouts still speak of Gorvok in fearful whispers. His tactics and the devastation he wrought at Dagger’s Sheath serve as a warning of the giants’ cruelty and the dangers still facing Ironhold.

### 🎯 Ambition
To become the most feared warlord of the new age and earn a place at Grondar’s side as his chosen executioner.

---
### 🔥 Motivation
Gorvok is driven by rage, pride, and a deep hatred for civilization. He sees dwarves as weaklings hiding behind stone and tradition, and every ruin he leaves behind is a monument to his strength.

---
### 🧩 Adventure Hooks
- The party may cross paths with Gorvok again, either as a vengeful foe or a key commander in future battles.
- His presence in the command tent suggests he is privy to the giants’ larger strategies—capturing or interrogating him could reveal vital intelligence.
- Rumors of Gorvok’s brutality may persist, and imitators or vengeful kin could seek retribution against the party.

**Current Status:**  
Gorvok the Maul remains alive and dangerous, a looming threat to Ironhold and a potential recurring villain for the heroes. His defeat would be a significant blow to the morale and organization of the giant-aligned warbands.
