### 🧑‍🎓 Background
Skarn was not born—he was forged. During the early resurgence of the giants, Grondar Earthcaller performed a ritual deep within a leyline chamber corrupted by the Flaming Retribution. This ritual called upon the elemental forces of fire and stone to create a living weapon. From the molten core of the mountain, Skarn emerged—a being of flame and fury, bound by runes and purpose.

Skarn’s existence is a direct result of the giants’ renewed connection to the elemental planes. He is both a product and a symbol of their ability to channel and manipulate elemental energies, serving as a bridge between the material world and the raw power of fire and earth. His presence in the warbands demonstrates the giants’ mastery of elemental rituals and their willingness to reshape the world through these ancient, destructive forces.

Though he speaks little, Skarn is known to chant in ancient tongues during battle, invoking forgotten elemental names and prophecies. He believes the world must be cleansed—burned down to its bones so that a new age may rise. He sees the giants as the rightful stewards of this rebirth and serves Grondar with unwavering devotion.

### 🎯 Ambition
To awaken the elemental heart of the mountains and bring about a new age of fire and stone.

### 🔥 Motivation
Skarn is driven by fanaticism and elemental instinct. He views dwarves as parasites who have mined too deep and too greedily, disturbing the balance of the world. His magic is not just destructive—it is ritualistic, meant to reshape the land and purge the old order.

### 🧩 Adventure Hooks
- His runes may match those found in corrupted dwarven relics, hinting at Varric’s involvement.
- He could be encountered performing a ritual to awaken a dormant elemental guardian.
- If defeated, his essence may linger, corrupting the land or whispering through flame.

**Current Status:**
