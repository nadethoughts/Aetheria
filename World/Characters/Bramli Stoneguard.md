## 🛡️ Bramli Stoneguard – Captain of the Royal Guard

- **Race**: Dwarf
- **Gender**: Male
- **Alignment**: Lawful Good
- **Role**: Defender of the Throne, Commander of the King’s Shield
- **Faction**: Loyal to King Hargrin Deepmantle

### 🧱 Background

Bramli was born into a long-standing military family that has served the royal line of Ironhold for generations. He trained in the Stoneguard Barracks from a young age, rising through the ranks not by bloodline, but by sheer discipline and unwavering loyalty. During the Flaming Retribution, Bramli led the evacuation of the outer halls, personally holding the gate long enough for hundreds to escape into the deep strongholds.

After the cataclysm, King Hargrin appointed him Captain of the Royal Guard—a position Bramli treats as both a sacred duty and a personal oath. He is known for his unshakable presence, his strict adherence to protocol, and his deep suspicion of political maneuvering.

### 🎯 Ambition

To protect the throne and ensure that Ironhold remains united and secure from both external and internal threats.

### 🔥 Motivation

Bramli believes that the greatest threat to Ironhold is not the giants, but division from within. He sees Varric Blackvein’s rise as a slow rot in the foundation of dwarven unity. Though not a politician, Bramli keeps a close eye on the court and quietly supports those who remain loyal to the king.

### 🧩 Adventure Hooks

- May assign the party a covert mission to investigate suspicious troop movements or missing supplies.
- Could be framed for a political assassination to destabilize the king’s inner circle.
- If killed or incapacitated, it would leave the king vulnerable and signal a major shift in the power balance.
