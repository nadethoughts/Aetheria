## 📚 High Loremaster Baelgrin Deepdelve – Keeper of the Deep Records

- **Race**: Dwarf
- **Gender**: Male
- **Alignment**: Lawful Neutral
- **Role**: Senior Scholar of Ironhold, Advisor to the King
- **Faction**: Loyal to King Hargrin Deepmantle

### 🧱 Background

Baelgrin Deepdelve has served the royal court of Ironhold for over a century, having earned his title through decades of study, excavation, and translation of ancient dwarven texts. He is one of the few remaining scholars who remembers the world before the Flaming Retribution and has firsthand knowledge of the kingdom’s lost outer holdings.

He was once a field archaeologist, known for his expeditions into the ruins of the First and Second Ages. After a cave-in nearly claimed his life, he retired to the archives and became the kingdom’s foremost authority on dwarven history, rune lore, and ancient treaties. His memory is sharp, and his instincts are rarely wrong.

### 🎯 Ambition

To preserve the truth of dwarven history and ensure that Ironhold does not repeat the mistakes of the past.

### 🔥 Motivation

Baelgrin is deeply suspicious of Varric Blackvein’s rise and the sudden resurgence of ancient runes bearing both dwarven and giantic influence. He believes something is stirring beneath the surface—something that echoes the darkest chapters of dwarven history. Though not a warrior, he is a quiet force of resistance, working behind the scenes to uncover the truth.

### 🧩 Adventure Hooks

- May provide the party with ancient maps, forgotten prophecies, or access to sealed archives.
- Could be targeted by the Hollowed Flame for knowing too much.
- Might leave behind a coded journal or rune-locked vault if assassinated.
