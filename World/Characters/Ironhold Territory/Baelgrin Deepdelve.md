### 🧑‍🎓 Background
Baelgrin Deepdelve has served Ironhold’s royal court for over a century, earning his title through decades of study, excavation, and translation of ancient dwarven texts. He is one of the few remaining scholars who remembers the world in the distant past and has firsthand knowledge of the kingdom’s lost outer holdings. Once a field archaeologist, a near-fatal cave-in led him to retire to the archives, where he became the kingdom’s foremost authority on dwarven history, rune lore, and ancient treaties.

### 🏰 Current Status (Post-Cracked Granite)
- **Archmage and Trusted Advisor:** Baelgrin played a pivotal role in the final confrontation with Varric Silvervein. When the party presented their evidence, Baelgrin was called to verify the authenticity of the recording rod and the battle map. Using his arcane expertise, he confirmed the evidence was genuine and revealed hidden giant runes on the map, identifying Grondar Earthcaller and Korak Flintshard as giant leaders. His testimony was instrumental in exposing Varric’s betrayal and convincing King Hargrin of the true threat facing Ironhold.
- **Guardian of Lore:** Baelgrin’s knowledge of ancient runes and history proved vital in understanding the significance of the Rings of Coram and the elemental rituals performed by the giants. He has since begun leading efforts to reclaim and protect other ancient dwarven sites, ensuring their secrets are not used against Ironhold again.
- **Political Influence:** With the king’s council shaken by the exposure of Varric’s conspiracy, Baelgrin’s loyalty and wisdom have made him one of King Hargrin’s most trusted advisors. He now oversees the kingdom’s arcane research and is a key figure in planning Ironhold’s magical defenses for the coming war.
- **Symbol of Dwarven Memory:** Baelgrin’s steadfastness and deep memory have become a rallying point for the dwarves, reminding them of their history and the importance of learning from the past. He is respected by both loyalists and reformers, and his presence reassures the people that Ironhold’s legacy is in safe hands.
