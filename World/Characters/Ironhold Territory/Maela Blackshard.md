### 🧑‍🎓 Background
Maela Blackshard rose from the lesser nobility of Ironhold, her family known for their discretion and subtlety rather than martial prowess. Gifted with a keen mind and a talent for reading people, Maela was recruited into the king’s service as a court whisperer—a role that quickly expanded as her network of informants grew. She now oversees the clandestine operations of Ironhold, gathering intelligence, rooting out sedition, and ensuring the king is never caught unawares.

Maela’s methods are quiet but effective. She prefers blackmail, coded messages, and subtle manipulation to open confrontation. Her loyalty to King Hargrin is genuine, but she is not above bending the law or making difficult choices for the greater good of Ironhold.
