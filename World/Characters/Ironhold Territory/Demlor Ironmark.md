## Role in The Cracked Granite

### Key Events & Achievements

- **Discovery of the Giant Threat:** Demlor’s investigative skills were crucial in uncovering the resurgence of the giants and their alliance with trolls, ogres, and elemental forces. He identified corrupted runes and elemental rituals, providing the first evidence of the giants’ return and their new magic.
- **Rings of Coram:** At the ancient dwarven monument, Demlor led the party in disrupting a ritual that would have created more elemental thralls. His kineticist abilities helped neutralize the elemental corruption and secure the site for Ironhold.
- **Rescue of the Captives:** Demlor coordinated the infiltration of the ogre camp, using his investigative acumen to locate and free dwarven prisoners. His actions saved over twenty lives and provided vital intelligence about the enemy’s plans.
- **Exposing the Traitor:** Demlor’s attention to detail and relentless pursuit of the truth were instrumental in gathering evidence against Varric Silvervein, the traitorous councilor. His findings helped the party present an airtight case to King Deepmantle, leading to Varric’s arrest and the purging of the king’s council.
- **Unifying the Clans:** Demlor’s advocacy for the clanless and his example of merit-based heroism inspired a shift in dwarven politics. His knighthood as a Warden of the Granite Crown set a precedent for recognizing valor and skill over bloodline.
