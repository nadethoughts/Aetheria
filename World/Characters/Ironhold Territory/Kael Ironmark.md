### 🧑‍🎓 Background
Kael Ironmark was born in the outer reaches of Ironhold, raised among the mountain patrols and trained in the art of survival, tracking, and reconnaissance. He earned his captaincy after leading a daring rescue mission during a border skirmish in the Second Age. Known for his sharp instincts and unshakable composure, he was chosen to lead the security detail for the colony of Dagger’s Sheath. When the colony was attacked, Kael fought to the last, escaping with a handful of wounded scouts and navigating treacherous mountain passes to return to Ironhold. Most of his companions died along the way, and he now carries the weight of their loss and the burden of unfinished duty.

### 🏰 Current Status (Post-Cracked Granite)
- **Rescued Survivor:** During the events of The Cracked Granite, Kael was discovered by the party trapped and injured in the collapsed mines of Dagger’s Sheath. He was rescued and provided critical intelligence about the attack, confirming that giants and their ogre allies were responsible and that many dwarven settlers had been captured rather than killed.
- **Key Witness:** Kael provided the party with a survey map and firsthand accounts of the giants’ tactics, the presence of elemental-infused thralls, and the fate of the missing colonists. His testimony was instrumental in convincing Ironhold’s leadership of the true nature and scale of the threat.
- **Wounded but Determined:** Though injured and unable to travel with the party immediately, Kael marked a safe location on the map to recover and instructed the party to retrieve him after their mission. He remains committed to warning the king and aiding in the rescue of the remaining survivors.
- **Haunted by Loss:** Kael’s sense of duty and guilt over the fall of Dagger’s Sheath drive him to ensure Ironhold is never caught unprepared again. He is quietly gathering evidence of sabotage or betrayal, suspecting that the attack was not a random act of violence.
