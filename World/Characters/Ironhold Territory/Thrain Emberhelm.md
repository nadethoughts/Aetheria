Captain Thrain Emberhelm is the commander of **[[Hammergate Hold]]**, a dwarven frontier watchtower in _The Cracked Granite_. He is a seasoned military leader—pragmatic, disciplined, and respected by his troops. When the party arrives at **[[Hammergate Hold]]** with 21 rescued dwarves, Emberhelm receives them with concern and urgency. He listens carefully to their report about the destruction of Dagger’s Sheath and the organized ogre threat, and quickly begins coordinating defensive measures and alerting other watchtowers.

Emberhelm is not part of the political intrigue in Ironhold but serves as a stabilizing force on the frontier. He assigns the party a critical mission to investigate **[[Sentinel’s Rise]]**, a nearby watchtower that has gone silent under suspicious orders from **Grand Regent [[Varric Silvervein]]**. His actions show trust in the party’s judgment and a commitment to protecting dwarven lives above political maneuvering.
