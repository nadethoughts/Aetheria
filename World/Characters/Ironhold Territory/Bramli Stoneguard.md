Bramli Stoneguard was born into a long-standing military family that has served the royal line of Ironhold for generations. He rose through the ranks by discipline and loyalty, not bloodline, and became Captain of the Royal Guard after the Flaming Retribution. Bramli is known for his unshakable presence, strict adherence to protocol, and deep suspicion of political intrigue. During the campaign, he was one of the few in the king’s council to remain above suspicion and was a quiet but steadfast supporter of King Hargrin Deepmantle.

### 🏰 Current Status (Post-Cracked Granite)
- **Protector of the Crown**: Bramli played a pivotal role in the final confrontation with Varric Silvervein, the traitorous regent. When the party presented evidence of Varric’s betrayal, Bramli was the first to move, physically restraining Varric and ensuring he could not escape justice. His vigilance and readiness prevented the traitor from fleeing the throne room and helped maintain order during a tense and dangerous moment.
- **Trusted Advisor**: With the king’s council shaken by the exposure of Varric’s conspiracy, Bramli’s loyalty and clear-headedness have made him one of King Hargrin’s most trusted advisors. He now leads the reorganization of the royal guard and oversees the security of Ironhold as the kingdom prepares for war against the giants.
- **Symbol of Unity**: Bramli’s actions during the crisis have made him a symbol of dwarven unity and resilience. He is respected by both loyalists and reformers, and his presence reassures the people of Ironhold that the throne is protected from both external and internal threats.
- **Military Reformer**: In the aftermath, Bramli has advocated for reforms in the guard and the council, emphasizing vigilance, merit, and the need to root out complacency and corruption. He works closely with the party and other heroes of the Granite Crown to ensure Ironhold is ready for the coming war.

### 🎯 Ambition
To protect the throne and ensure Ironhold remains united and secure from both external threats (the giants and their elemental allies) and internal division.
