## ⛏️ Marnak Deepforge – Guildmaster of the Ironhold Miners’ Consortium

- **Race**: Dwarf
- **Gender**: Male
- **Alignment**: Lawful Neutral (with shades of ambition)
- **Role**: Master of Mining Operations, Economic Powerbroker
- **Faction**: Secretly aligned with Varric Silvervein

### 🧱 Background

Marnak Deepforge rose from humble beginnings in the lower tunnels of Ironhold. A brilliant surveyor and shrewd negotiator, he unified several competing mining clans under the Ironhold Miners’ Consortium, becoming one of the most influential non-noble dwarves in the kingdom. His success earned him a seat at the king’s economic council, though he has always resented the nobles who look down on his “dirty hands.”

After the Flaming Retribution, Marnak was instrumental in reopening collapsed tunnels and restoring ore flow to the forges. But he also discovered something else—**a hidden vein of crystal-laced stone etched with ancient runes**, deep beneath the mountains. He brought this secret to Varric Silvervein, seeing in him a kindred spirit: a dwarf who would break the old order and reward those who built Ironhold from the ground up.

### 🎯 Ambition

To become the first common-born dwarf to sit on the royal council as a peer—and to control the kingdom’s most powerful resource veins.

### 🔥 Motivation

Marnak believes the nobility has failed Ironhold. He sees Varric’s rise as a chance to reshape the kingdom into a meritocracy—one where wealth and results matter more than bloodlines. His loyalty is not to Varric personally, but to the vision of a new Ironhold where dwarves like him are no longer second-class citizens.

### 🧩 Adventure Hooks

- May offer the party access to restricted tunnels or resources—at a price.
- Could be caught falsifying mining reports or diverting materials to Varric’s faction.
- If exposed, he may try to buy his way out or turn on Varric to save himself.
