Salt Spawn is the collective name for the monsters and aberrations that surged into Tidewatch Ward during the magical upheaval caused by the Pearl’s removal. Drawn by the storm’s unleashed energy, these creatures come from the depths of the sea, elemental planes, and even corrupted remnants of the mortal world. They share no common physiology—ranging from eel-like stalkers to colossal reef-armored beasts—but all are united by their hunger for magic and the chaos that birthed them. Their presence marks the ward as a place where the natural order has drowned beneath the tide of elemental fury.
