# **Fredrick Wainshore, Iron Tide Gatekeeper**
![[Fredrick Wainshore.png]]
- **Rank:** Sergeant of the Iron Tide Regiment
- **Appearance:** Mid-forties, thick-shouldered, salt-gray hair tied back. His armor is oiled to resist the sea air, though barnacles still cling to the lower greaves. His halberd bears an engraved tide mark near the haft — ten years of service.
- **Personality:** Grizzled but professional; the kind of soldier who measures everyone by whether they’ll survive the night.
- **Voice:** Rough and deliberate, coastal dialect with clipped consonants.
