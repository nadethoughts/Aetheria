---
#### **Background**
Veyric Thorne was once a decorated officer of the Iron Tide Regiment, known for his unwavering discipline and tactical brilliance. When the Pearl’s surge devastated Tidewatch Ward, Veyric refused to abandon his post. He led his squad through the chaos, holding choke points against monsters and cultists for days. But the ward changed him. Coral grafted to his skin, barnacles crusted his armor, and bioluminescent veins marked him as something otherworldly. Branded a monster by his own command, Veyric chose exile over surrender.
