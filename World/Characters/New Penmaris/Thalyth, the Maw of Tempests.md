_(Titles whispered by cultists: The Drowning Voice, The Tide Unbound)_
![[Thalyth.png]]

---
#### **Origins**
Thalyth is not a mortal sorcerer or a mere elemental—it is an ancient abyssal entity born from the chaos where sea and storm collide. When the Pearl was disturbed, its protective magic weakened the barriers between planes, allowing Thalyth to slip through into Aetheria. The demon seized this opportunity to claim dominion over Tidewatch Ward, feeding on the unleashed elemental energy and the fear of survivors.

---
#### **Nature & Appearance**
- A towering, semi-aquatic fiend whose form shifts between storm and flesh.
- Its body is draped in kelp-like tendrils and barnacle-encrusted armor, with jagged fins protruding from its spine.
- Eyes glow like lightning trapped in deep water, and its maw is a vortex of teeth and swirling brine.
- Wherever it walks, the air thickens with mist, and the ground floods with saltwater.

---
#### **Personality & Influence**
- Thalyth speaks in crashing waves and distant thunder, its words echoing in the minds of the faithful.
- It promises salvation through surrender—those who drown in its name rise as storm-touched zealots.
- The Stormcallers worship it as a god, believing the Pearl’s awakening was its herald.

---
#### **Powers**
- **Tempest Dominion:** Commands storms, summoning tidal surges, lightning strikes, and hurricane winds.
- **Abyssal Call:** Can enthrall mortals, twisting them into storm-marked cultists or elemental thralls.
- **Pearl Resonance:** Draws strength from the Pearl’s magic, making it nearly invincible near the artifact.
- **Drowning Curse:** Victims slain by Thalyth or its magic rise as drowned husks under its control.

---
#### **Goals**
- Secure the Pearl as a conduit to amplify its power and spread its dominion across the Verdant Strand.
- Expand the Stormcaller cult, converting refugees and broken souls into zealots.
- Sink New Penmaris beneath the waves, claiming it as a shrine to the storm eternal.

#### **Hooks for the Campaign**
- **Session 3–4:** The party uncovers signs of Thalyth’s growing influence—ritual sites, drowned thralls, and whispers in the mist.
- **Session 5:** The demon manifests fully during a climactic ritual, forcing the party to choose between destroying the Pearl or facing Thalyth at full strength.
- **Session 6 Finale:** A battle against Thalyth in the flooded Gloamways, with the Pearl’s fate—and the city’s survival—hanging in the balance.
