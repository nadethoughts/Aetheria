The Stormcallers are a fanatical sect that emerged in the aftermath of the **Flaming Retribution**, believing the cataclysm was not a disaster but a divine cleansing. They worship the fury of the sea and sky, claiming the storm is a living will that must be obeyed. To them, the Pearl is not a relic—it is the heart of the tempest, a sacred core that must remain unclaimed by mortals.

---
#### **Origins & Beliefs**
- Formed from survivors who saw the magical storm over [[Tidewatch Ward]] as a holy sign.
- Preach that the storm is a god’s voice, and the Pearl is its soul.
- Their doctrine: _“The tide will take what is owed. The wind will judge the unworthy.”_
- They view rebuilding efforts as blasphemy, believing the ward should remain drowned and forsaken.

---
#### **Symbols & Rituals**
- Emblem: A spiral of waves encircling a lightning bolt, painted in white and blue on banners and bodies.
- Rituals involve chanting in flooded plazas, burning driftwood offerings, and summoning fog with elemental magic.
- Initiates undergo “The Drowning”—a near-fatal immersion in storm-touched waters to prove devotion.

---
#### **Structure**
- Led by **[[High Caller Veyris]]**, a zealot who claims to hear the storm’s whispers.
- Organized into “Circles,” each responsible for sabotage, recruitment, and ritual upkeep.
- Elemental adepts wield magic tied to wind and water, often enhanced by relics scavenged from the ruins.

---
#### **Goals**
- Prevent anyone from claiming or moving the Pearl.
- Expand the storm’s influence, using rituals to intensify magical weather and mutations.
- Convert or eliminate those who oppose the storm’s will—especially adventurers and the [[Iron Tide Regiment]].

---
#### **Methods**
- Spread fear through omens and sabotage: collapsing structures, summoning unnatural fog, and unleashing mutated beasts.
- Whisper promises of safety and power to desperate refugees, swelling their ranks with the hopeless.
- Strike alliances of convenience with pirates or cultists, though they ultimately seek dominion for the storm alone.
