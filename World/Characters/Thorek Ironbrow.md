## 🔨 Thorek Ironbrow – Royal Blacksmith of Ironhold

- **Race**: Dwarf
- **Gender**: Male
- **Alignment**: Lawful Neutral
- **Role**: Master of the Forge, Keeper of the King’s Armory
- **Faction**: Loyal to King Hargrin Deepmantle

### 🧱 Background

Thorek Ironbrow was born into a long line of smiths who served the royal family of Ironhold. His father perished during the Flaming Retribution while sealing the gates of the Deepforge to protect the last of the dwarven relics. Thorek inherited not only his father’s hammer but also the burden of preserving the kingdom’s martial legacy.

He rose to prominence during the reconstruction of Ironhold’s inner defenses, forging weapons and armor for the king’s elite guard. His craftsmanship is unmatched, and his loyalty to King Hargrin is absolute. He views the forge as sacred—a place where dwarven strength is reborn with every strike of the hammer.

### 🎯 Ambition

To restore the Deepforge to its full glory and ensure that Ironhold is never again caught unprepared.

### 🔥 Motivation

Thorek is driven by duty, legacy, and a deep-seated belief that the strength of the dwarves lies in their steel. He distrusts politics and sees Varric’s rise as a threat to the unity and discipline of the kingdom. Though not a courtly man, he commands respect through action and integrity.

### 🧩 Adventure Hooks

- He may offer the party custom-forged weapons or armor if they prove themselves.
- He suspects sabotage in the forge’s supply lines—possibly linked to Varric’s faction.
- If assassinated or framed, his death would send shockwaves through the loyalist ranks.
