## 🪓 Name: Korrak Flintshard – Hammer of the Deep

- **Race**: Stone Giant
- **Gender**: Male
- **Alignment**: Neutral Evil
- **Role**: Grondar’s Field Commander and Enforcer
- **Faction**: Giant Warband

### 🧱 Background

Korrak Flintshard was born in the deep caverns beneath the Shattered Peaks, raised among the remnants of a once-proud stone giant clan. As a youth, he was marked by a prophecy carved into the cavern walls: “The hammer shall rise when the mountain breaks.” When the Flaming Retribution shattered the surface and awakened the leyline beneath his ancestral home, Korrak took it as a sign.

He was among the first to answer Grondar Earthcaller’s call, pledging his strength and loyalty to the High Voice of the Stone. Korrak believes in the old ways—strength, endurance, and the right of the giants to rule the mountains. He views dwarves as parasites who hollow out the bones of the world and must be driven out.

### 🎯 Ambition

To become the warlord of the surface once the dwarves are defeated and to restore the ancient dominion of the stone giants.

### 🔥 Motivation

Korrak is driven by prophecy, pride, and a deep hatred for the dwarves who he believes desecrated his ancestors’ sacred halls. He sees himself as the hammer of retribution, chosen to break the dwarves and reclaim the mountains.

### 🧩 Adventure Hooks

- Leads the warband that destroyed Dagger’s Sheath.
- May be encountered again leading a siege or guarding a leyline ritual site.
- Could be a mid-campaign boss fight or a recurring antagonist who escapes and returns stronger.
