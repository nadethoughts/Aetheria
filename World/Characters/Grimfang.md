Grimfang is the leader of the [[Goblin]]s that live in [[The Burned Wood]]. He has this role as he is the most experienced and strong of the Goblins. He has the respect of the different tribes even though they do not really respect each other. Even though he is the oldest of the Goblins, he is by no means an old [[Goblin]]. he is still in his prime of life, and doesn't have the wisdom that age brings. He is no coward, but also doesn't seek a fight if he thinks that he doesn't have the upper hand. Having been a slave, he also doesn't seek to subjugate others and looks to make alliances where possible as to make him and the rag tag band of [[Goblin]]s he calls his people stronger and more protected.
