## **The Giants of Aetheria: Servants of the Dark Pantheon**

### 🗻 **Core Belief**

The giants are ancient, malevolent beings who believe they were forged to dominate the mortal world. They are **devout servants of the Dark Pantheon**, particularly **Erabose**, whom they revere as the rightful sovereign of all divine power. Their elemental gods are not neutral forces of nature—they are **corrupted reflections** of elemental power, twisted by shadow and ambition.

The giants see themselves as the **chosen instruments of divine ruin**, and their society is built around conquest, domination, and the worship of **dark elemental deities** who serve Erabose’s will.

## 🕯️ **Relationship to Vorath**

Vorath, as a fallen La Pelu, was never a god—merely a powerful demigod. The giants allied with him during the War of the Fractured Dawn because his goals aligned with theirs: the destruction of the divine orders and the collapse of mortal empires. But they never served him. Their loyalty has always been to the **true gods of the Dark Pantheon**.

## 🔥 **The Dark Elemental Gods of the Giants**

These gods are **fully aligned with Erabose**, and their worship is central to giant culture. Each tribe may elevate one above the others, but all are venerated as aspects of divine ruin.
