## The Giants of Aetheria: Servants of the Dark Pantheon

---
### 🧑‍🎓 Core Belief
The giants are ancient, malevolent beings who believe they were forged to dominate the mortal world. They are devout servants of the Dark Pantheon, particularly Erabose, whom they revere as the rightful sovereign of all divine power. Their elemental gods are not neutral forces of nature—they are corrupted reflections of elemental power, twisted by shadow and ambition. The giants see themselves as the chosen instruments of divine ruin, and their society is built around conquest, domination, and the worship of dark elemental deities who serve Erabose’s will.

### 🏰 Relationship to Vorath
Vorath, as a fallen La Pelu, was never a god—merely a powerful demigod. The giants allied with him during the War of the Fractured Dawn because his goals aligned with theirs: the destruction of the divine orders and the collapse of mortal empires. But they never served him. Their loyalty has always been to the true gods of the Dark Pantheon.

### 🔥 The Dark Elemental Gods of the Giants
These gods are fully aligned with Erabose, and their worship is central to giant culture. Each tribe may elevate one above the others, but all are venerated as aspects of divine ruin.
