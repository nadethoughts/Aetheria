## Goblins

# Fire Walker Tribe
![[Firewalker Goblin.png|300]]
This group of Goblins are marked by their skin. it is Green with what look to be red mud cracks in their skin. They are a tribe of Goblins that have subjugated themselves to a Coven of Hags that go by the same name. 

The fire walker tribe are Ruthless and deviant. They long for nothing but the destruction of Civilization and Brother hood. They are held together by a rough amount of rules. They respect strength and acknowledge that the Coven that they serve is more powerful than they are, and so they serve them. Should the coven ever be broken than the Tribe will likely fall into chaos, where either they all destroy each other or one creature rises to the top as the undisputed powerhouse of the tribe.
## Slavery
The Fire Walker Tribe has no problem with slavery and are more than happy to find other species and even other Goblin tribes to subjugate and enslave. They will often use these slaves as Fodder for battle during times of war.
## Description
- **Overall Appearance:** The goblin has green skin marked with a distinctive cracked-earth pattern that glows in a deep red hue, giving the impression of fissures filled with ember-like energy. This pattern runs across the arms, chest, and visible portions of the body, reinforcing the Firewalker tribe’s volcanic aesthetic.    
- **Armor and Clothing:** The goblin wears rugged, battle-worn armor consisting of a horned helmet and mismatched metal plates. The helmet is heavily weathered, with visible cracks and rust, and features two prominent curved horns. The shoulder armor is similarly aged, with scratches and a dull metallic finish. A tattered, reddish-brown scarf or cloth wraps around the neck and upper chest, adding a tribal flair and possibly serving as a protective layer.    
- **Weapon:** The goblin grips a jagged, crude sword in its right hand. The blade looks forged from rough, dark metal, with an uneven edge that suggests it was made for brutal hacking rather than finesse. The hilt is simple and functional, matching the goblin’s savage aesthetic.    
- **Other Details:** The goblin’s belt is wide and fastened with a large, worn buckle. Attached to the belt are small pouches, likely for carrying essentials or reagents. The forearms are wrapped in thick, rugged cloth strips, and the hands have sharp, claw-like nails. The overall attire is dark and earthy, complementing the goblin’s fiery red cracks and green skin.

# [[The Burned Wood]]
The Goblins of [[The Burned Wood]] are a collection of a number of different tribes. They were warring tribes in the Goblin Lands and were forced into Slavery by [[#Fire Walker Tribe]]. Their leader is an "older" Goblin by the name of [[Grimfang]] at the moment and are just looking to survive. In time they may create their own culture, but currently they are a motley crew of Fighting aged, Goblins that have no way of getting back to their homeland, and are forced to work together for survival.
