Little Green creatures with a mean streak in them that have a preponderancy to like to see things explode.

# Fire Walker Tribe
This group of Goblins are marked by their skin. it is Green with what look to be red mud cracks in their skin. They are a tribe of Goblins that have subjugated themselves to a Coven of Hags that go by the same name. 

The fire walker tribe are Ruthless and deviant. They long for nothing but the destruction of Civilization and Brother hood. They are held together by a rough amount of rules. They respect strength and acknowledge that the Coven that they serve is more powerful than they are, and so they serve them. Should the coven ever be broken than the Tribe will likely fall into chaos, where either they all destroy each other or one creature rises to the top as the undisputed powerhouse of the tribe.
## Slavery
The Fire Walker Tribe has no problem with slavery and are more than happy to find other species and even other Goblin tribes to subjugate and enslave. They will often use these slaves as Fodder for battle during times of war.
