### 🐾 The Beastkin of [[Aetheria]]
![[Beastkin.png|300]]
Beastkin are humanoids with pronounced animal traits—wings, claws, tails, or more. Their origins are mysterious: some claim ties to fey realms, others to lycanthropic or magical transformation. Beastkin thrive on the edges of civilization, acting as scouts, wardens, and guides. Their adaptability and primal instincts make them excellent survivors in the wilds and monster-haunted ruins of the [[Verdant Strand]].

- **Role in Adventure:** Invaluable for exploring dangerous wards, tracking monsters, and surviving magical hazards.
