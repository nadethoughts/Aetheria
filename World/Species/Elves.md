![[Elf.png|300]]
### **Origins and Homeland**
The Elves of [[Aetheria]] are an ancient people whose roots stretch back to the earliest ages of the world. Their homeland, **[[Luminael]]**, lies beyond the [[Emeraldine Mountains]] in the west of [[Solaris]]—a region of deep, enchanted forests and hidden valleys. The fate of [[Luminael]] after the [[Flaming Retribution]] is uncertain, with rumors of untouched groves and lost sanctuaries.
### **Culture and Society**
Elven society is built on tradition, memory, and a profound connection to the land. Elves are known for their longevity, grace, and discipline. Their communities are woven into the forests, living in harmony with nature and the spirits of the world. Elven cities are often hidden, blending seamlessly with the trees and streams.
- **Hierarchy:** Elven society is typically led by councils of elders, seers, and mystics. Leadership is earned through wisdom, service, and mastery of psionics.
- **Values:** Elves value patience, foresight, and the preservation of knowledge. They are slow to change, but fiercely protective of their traditions and kin.
### **Psionics: The Elven Power**
Elves of [[Aetheria]] are **psionic creatures**. Their power comes not from arcane or divine magic, but from the disciplined mastery of mind, spirit, and perception.
- **Psionic Arts:** Elven psionics allow for telepathic communication, emotional sensing, and the manipulation of the world through thought and will. Some elves can influence dreams, memories, or even the flow of time within their sacred groves.
- **No Magic:** Unlike other peoples, elves do not generally practice arcane, divine, or elemental magic. Their abilities are entirely psionic, developed through meditation, discipline, and tradition.
### **Religion and Philosophy**
Elves honor the cycles of nature and the spirits of the land. Their faith is focused on ancestral spirits, [[Eldran]](the guiding luminescence of wisdom), and the harmony of all living things—rather than worship of grand deities.
- **Rituals:** Elven rituals involve meditation, song, and offerings to the spirits of the forest. Seasonal festivals mark the turning of the year and the renewal of life.
- **Philosophy:** Elves believe in balance, the sanctity of memory, and the importance of every living thing in the tapestry of existence.
### **The [[Flaming Retribution]] and Its Aftermath**
The fate of [[Luminael]] after the [[Flaming Retribution]] is a matter of rumor and legend. Some say the deep forests shielded the elves from the worst of the cataclysm, while others whisper of lost groves and vanished cities.
- **Survivors:** Elven refugees may be found in other regions of [[Solaris]], seeking sanctuary and mourning the loss of their homeland.
- **Mystery:** The true state of [[Luminael]] is unknown; it may be untouched, transformed, or hiding secrets yet to be revealed.
### **Elves in the Wider World**
Elves are respected and sometimes feared by other peoples of [[Aetheria]]. Their mastery of psionics and ancient lore makes them valuable allies and dangerous foes. Elven diplomats, scouts, and mystics travel the world, seeking knowledge, lost kin, and ways to restore what was lost.
- **Relations:** Elves maintain cautious alliances with dwarves, humans, and other races, but rarely reveal all their secrets.
- **Role in [[Solaris]]:** Elven wisdom and psionics are sought after in times of crisis, and their traditions influence the cultures of neighboring regions.
