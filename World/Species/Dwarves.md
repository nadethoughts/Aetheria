## 🛡️ **The Dwarves of [[Aetheria]]**

The dwarves of [[Aetheria]] are a proud, enduring people shaped by stone, fire, and tradition. Their civilization is ancient, rooted in the deep places of the world, and defined by resilience in the face of catastrophe. When the [[Flaming Retribution]] scorched the surface, the dwarves of [[Ironhold]] sealed their gates and survived—alone, but unbroken.

Dwarven society is structured around powerful [[Ironhold#The Clans of Ironhold|clans]], each with its own function, traditions, and political influence. These clans are tight-knit and proud, [[Ironhold#The Clans of Ironhold|clans]] loyalties that span generations. Some are warriors, others scholars, engineers, merchants, mystics, or scouts. A rare few walk without clan, either by choice or exile, and are viewed with a mix of suspicion and respect.

Politically, the dwarves are divided between two major factions:

- **Isolationists**, who believe [[Ironhold]] should remain sealed and self-sufficient.
- **Expansionists**, who support [[King Hargrin Deepmantle]]’s vision of reclaiming the surface and rebuilding dwarven influence.

Though the dwarves are deeply spiritual, they do not worship a unique pantheon. Instead, they revere select gods from the broader divine orders—especially those tied to craftsmanship, endurance, and elemental mastery. Their most honored deities include:

- **[[Durnhal]], the Forgefather**
- **[[Gemmara]], the Artisan’s Eye**
- **[[Karnun]], the Gearwright**
- **[[Thalgrun]], Lord of Flame**
- **[[Varnok]], the Stoneheart**
- **[[Aelra]], Mistress of Flow**

The dwarves also remember the **[[Giant Wars]]**, a brutal conflict in which they drove the giant tribes to the brink of extinction. Though the giants once allied with [[The Dark Pantheon]], the dwarves believe their threat has long since passed.

Now, with the gates of [[Ironhold]] open once more, the dwarves stand at a crossroads—between tradition and ambition, isolation and expansion, memory and legacy.
