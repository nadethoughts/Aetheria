## 🛡️ The Dwarves of Aetheria
The dwarves of Aetheria are a proud, enduring people shaped by stone, fire, and tradition. Their civilization is ancient, rooted in the deep places of the world, and defined by resilience in the face of catastrophe. When the Flaming Retribution scorched the surface, the dwarves of Ironhold sealed their gates and survived—alone, but unbroken.

### 🏰 Society & Clans
Dwarven society is structured around powerful clans, each with its own function, traditions, and political influence. These clans are tight-knit and proud, with loyalties that span generations. Some are warriors, others scholars, engineers, merchants, mystics, or scouts. A rare few walk without clan, either by choice or exile, and are viewed with a mix of suspicion and respect.

**Major Clans of Ironhold:**
- **Stoneguard:** Elite warriors and royal protectors, the shield of Ironhold.
- **Deepforge:** Masters of mining and metallurgy, fueling Ironhold’s industry and defense.
- **Runeweaver:** Scholars, artificers, and keepers of arcane tradition, unlocking secrets of ancient runes and leyline magic.
- **Hollowbrand:** Traders, bankers, and negotiators, controlling Ironhold’s wealth and commerce.
- **Blackshard:** Silent and watchful, dealing in secrets as spies, informants, and shadow operatives.
- **Deepshiver:** Mystics and spiritual guides, walking the line between faith and prophecy.
- **Ironmark:** Scouts, rangers, and wilderness wardens, Ironhold’s eyes beyond the stone.
- **Geargrind:** Engineers, machinists, and siegewrights, builders of the machines that keep Ironhold running.

### ⚔️ Factions & Politics
Politically, the dwarves are divided between two major factions:

- **Isolationists:** Believe Ironhold should remain sealed and self-sufficient.
- **Expansionists:** Support King Hargrin Deepmantle and the rebuilding of dwarven influence on the surface.

### 🔥 Faith & Memory
Though the dwarves are deeply spiritual, they do not worship a unique pantheon. Instead, they revere select gods from the broader divine orders—especially those tied to craftsmanship, endurance, and elemental mastery. Their most honored deities include:

- Durnhal, the Forgefather
- Gemmara, the Artisan’s Eye
- Karnun, the Gearwright
- Thalgrun, Lord of Flame
- Varnok, the Stoneheart
- Aelra, Mistress of Flow

The dwarves also remember the Giant Wars, a brutal conflict in which they drove the giant tribes to the brink of extinction. Though the giants once allied with The Dark Pantheon, the dwarves believe their threat has long since passed.

### 🧩 Recent Events: The Cracked Granite
- **Return of the Giants:** The events of The Cracked Granite revealed that the giant threat is far from gone. Giants, ogres, and elemental thralls have returned, threatening the dwarven colonies and Ironhold itself.
- **Political Upheaval:** The exposure of Varric Silvervein’s betrayal and the purge of traitors have shaken dwarven society, forcing the clans to confront both old rivalries and new alliances.
- **Elemental Super Soldier Project:** In response to the elemental threat and the need for new defenses, Demlor (a metal kineticist and investigator) has begun collaborating with High Loremaster Baelgrin Deepdelve on a project to create elemental dwarf warriors. This initiative seeks to harness elemental energies—infusing dwarven volunteers with controlled elemental power—to produce super soldiers capable of resisting corruption and standing against the giants’ thralls. The project is experimental and controversial, with some clans fearing it may compromise dwarven tradition or invite further danger, while others see it as essential for survival.
- **Clan Structure Under Scrutiny:** The traditional clan structure of Ironhold is now under scrutiny, especially in light of the extraordinary value provided to the king by Rurik—a dwarf who operated outside the usual clan hierarchy. Rurik’s actions and contributions have sparked debate about the role of clanless dwarves and whether merit and service should outweigh lineage and tradition in shaping Ironhold’s future.

### 🏔️ Current Status
Now, with the gates of Ironhold open once more, the dwarves stand at a crossroads—between tradition and ambition, isolation and expansion, memory and legacy. Their resilience and ingenuity will determine the fate of Ironhold and the future of Aetheria itself.
