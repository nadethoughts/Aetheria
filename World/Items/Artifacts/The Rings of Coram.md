### 🧑‍🎓 Historical Background
The Rings of Coram are a series of ancient stone circles, carved and consecrated by dwarven priests during the Second Age. Originally built as a place of communion with the elemental planes, the site was used for rituals of protection, binding, and the forging of alliances with elemental spirits. Over centuries, the Rings fell into disuse and legend, their true purpose lost to all but the most learned loremasters.

### 🏰 Role in The Cracked Granite
- **Elemental Convergence:** During the events of The Cracked Granite, the Rings of Coram became a focal point for the giants’ resurgence. The site was used by giant warbands to perform powerful rituals, channeling elemental energy to convert captured trolls and dwarves into elemental thralls.
- **Cave Giant Ritual Leader:** The party infiltrated the Rings and witnessed an unnamed cave giant overseeing the transformation process. This giant acted as the ritual leader and enforcer, commanding the warband and directing the elemental conversion of captives.
- **Battle and Discovery:** The party confronted the cave giant and his forces, disrupting the ritual and rescuing captives. The encounter revealed the giants’ mastery of elemental magic and their strategy of creating thralls from other monstrous races.
- **Lore and Clues:** The site contained runes and relics that hinted at the giants’ connection to the elemental planes and their mastery of ancient dwarven magic. Baelgrin Deepdelve later interpreted these clues to expose the true nature of the threat facing Ironhold.
