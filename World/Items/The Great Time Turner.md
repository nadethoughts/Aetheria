# The legend of the Great Time Turner
In the sacred annals of the [[Luakini o ka Manawa]] Temple, it is proclaimed: Behold the Great Time Turner, the divine regulator of time, the blessed instrument of [[Shananooah]], Goddess of Time and Space. From this holy artifact flows the very essence of time, its eternal currents guiding the steps of the world and maintaining the sacred balance of past, present, and future.

By divine decree, the Great Time Turner was wrought by the hands of [[Shananooah]] Herself, fashioned from the sands of time and imbued with Her celestial essence. It is written that the Turner is the heart of temporal harmony, its gears and cogs in perfect concord with the celestial spheres. Thus, does it ensure the unceasing flow of time and the orderly march of days.
