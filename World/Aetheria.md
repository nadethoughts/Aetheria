# 🌍 Aetheria
### The World of Aetheria
Aetheria is an ancient and vast world, a sphere of wonder and strife where divine legacies, elemental powers, and mortal ambition weave together in endless cycles of creation and destruction. Its lands are shaped by both natural forces and the scars of divine conflict, and its people endure within landscapes as varied as soaring mountain ranges, enchanted forests, storm-lashed coasts, and shattered plains.

## ✨ The [[Flaming Retribution]]
Aetheria was forever changed by the recent cataclysm known as the **[[Flaming Retribution]]**. Fire and ash swept across continents, seas boiled, and mountains split as if by the wrath of gods. Entire regions were annihilated or transformed, and countless civilizations perished. Yet amid the destruction, life clung on, rebuilding and reshaping.

Now, Aetheria stands at the dawn of the **4th Age**—a world where old powers stir, new nations rise, and the scars of the Retribution hide both peril and opportunity.

## 🌍 The Continents of Aetheria
Though much of Aetheria remains unmapped or veiled in myth, several great continents are known:
- **[[Solaris]]** – The most well-known and studied continent, rich in history and diversity. It is home to six distinct regions, each forever changed by the [[Flaming Retribution]].
- **Other Lands** – Rumors persist of continents across the oceans: frozen realms to the far north, sun-scorched deserts to the south, and shattered archipelagos adrift in storm-wracked seas. For now, these remain half-whispered stories, the promise of discovery for bold explorers.

## 🗺️ [[Solaris]]: The Continent of Six Regions
[[Solaris]] is a land scarred and reshaped, defined by six powerful regions—each bearing the marks of the [[Flaming Retribution]]:
### **[[Ironhold]]**
In the northwest rise the **[[Ironhold]] Mountains**, realm of the [[Dwarves]]. Masters of stone, steel, and magic, the [[Dwarves]] carved their halls deep into the mountains and endured the [[Flaming Retribution]] behind sealed gates. Now reopened, [[Ironhold]] balances ancient traditions with new ambitions, and cautiously engages with a changed world.
### [[Luminael]]
Beyond the **Emeraldine Mountains** in the west lies the homeland of the [[Elves]]. The fate of [[Luminael]] after the [[Flaming Retribution]] remains uncertain, its deep forests shrouded in mystery and rumor.
### **[[The Blessed Realm]]**
In the south stretched **[[The Blessed Realm]]**, once a shining monarchy devoted to order and divine grace. Now, the heart of the realm—[[Lumopolis]]—lies at the bottom of a giant boiling lake. The region is devastated, its fertile plains annihilated, and no organized government remains.
### **The Free Cities of the [[Vale]]**
At the continent’s heart lies the **[[Vale]]**, a fertile basin home to independent city-states. The [[Flaming Retribution]] brought flooding and destruction to many cities; some survived, others were lost. The [[Vale]] is fractured, with refugees and survivors forging new alliances and rivalries.
### **The [[Shimmering Shores]]**
Along the east ran the **[[Shimmering Shores]]**, a cosmopolitan stretch of coastline known for its harbors and ports. Half the region was destroyed and sunk into the ocean; the surviving land is now coastal, with ports and settlements clinging to the new shoreline.
### **[[Verdant Strand]]**
To the north lies the **[[Verdant Strand]]**, a region of rocky cliffs, pine forests, and brisk seas. The Retribution battered its towns and harbors, and the region is still in the process of rebuilding. Survivors gather in places like [[New Penmaris]], but prosperity remains a distant hope.

## 🌌 The Wider World
Aetheria holds far more than [[Solaris]] alone. Across its seas lie:
- **Uncharted Oceans** – Vast and dangerous waters where storms, leviathans, and ancient ruins dwell.
- **Other Continents** – Whispers speak of frozen northern kingdoms, southern deserts of glass, and archipelagos where ancient gods walked.
- **The Heavens and the Below** – Planes of existence beyond the mortal world, where the divine pantheons wage their eternal wars and mortals draw their magic.
For now, [[Solaris]] is the **center stage** of the age to come. Yet Aetheria as a whole waits, alive with mysteries, for those daring enough to uncover them.
