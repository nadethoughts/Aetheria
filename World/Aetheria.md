# 🌍 Aetheria

### The World of Aetheria

Aetheria is an ancient and vast world, a sphere of wonder and strife where divine legacies, elemental powers, and mortal ambition weave together in endless cycles of creation and destruction. Its lands are shaped by both natural forces and the scars of divine conflict, and its people endure within landscapes as varied as soaring mountain ranges, enchanted forests, storm-lashed coasts, and shattered plains.

## ✨ The Flaming Retribution

Aetheria was forever changed by the recent cataclysm known as the **Flaming Retribution**. Fire and ash swept across continents, seas boiled, and mountains split as if by the wrath of gods. Entire regions were annihilated or transformed, and countless civilizations perished. Yet amid the destruction, life clung on, rebuilding and reshaping.

Now, Aetheria stands in a **time of rebirth**—a world where old powers stir, new nations rise, and the scars of the Retribution hide both peril and opportunity.

## 🌍 The Continents of Aetheria

Though much of Aetheria remains unmapped or veiled in myth, several great continents are known:

- **Solaris** – The most well-known and studied continent, rich in history and diversity. It is home to six distinct regions (detailed below), where mortals strive to rebuild in the wake of the Flaming Retribution.
    
- **Other Lands** – Rumors persist of continents across the oceans: frozen realms to the far north, sun-scorched deserts to the south, and even shattered archipelagos adrift in storm-wracked seas. For now, these remain half-whispered stories, the promise of discovery for bold explorers.

## 🗺️ Solaris: The Continent of Six Regions

Solaris is a land scarred yet unbroken, defined by six powerful regions.

### **Ironhold**

In the northwest rise the **Ironhold Mountains**, realm of the Dwarves. Masters of stone, steel, and magic, the Dwarves carved their halls deep into the mountains and endured the Flaming Retribution behind sealed gates. Now reopened, Ironhold balances ancient traditions with new ambitions.

### **Luminael**

Beyond the **Emeraldine Mountains** in the west lies the psionic homeland of the Elves. In the deep forests of **Luminael**, Elves wield power not through sorcery but through **psionics**—discipline of the mind, spirit, and perception. They are guardians of secrets older than the Retribution.

### **The Blessed Realm**

In the south stretches the **Blessed Realm**, a shining monarchy devoted to order and divine grace. Its fertile **Sunlit Plains** provide food and trade for much of Solaris, and its rulers hold themselves as exemplars of stability amid chaos.

### **The Free Cities of the Vale**

At the continent’s heart lies the **Vale**, a fertile basin home to independent city-states. Here, diverse peoples gather in a tapestry of rivalries, alliances, and innovations. The Vale is the **melting pot of Solaris**, and many great adventures begin in its markets, guild halls, and courts.

### **The Shimmering Shores**

Along the east runs the **Shimmering Shores**, a cosmopolitan stretch of coastline known for its harbors and ports. Trade flows here from across Aetheria, making it a place of wealth, opportunity, and peril as merchant barons and sailors vie for dominance.

### **Verdant Strand**

To the north lies the **Verdant Strand**, a region of rocky cliffs, pine forests, and brisk seas. Though battered by the Retribution, its towns and harbors were rebuilt swiftly, driven by resilience and ambition. The Strand is a region of merchants, sailors, and adventurers, its people hardened by storm and stone.

## 🌌 The Wider World

Aetheria holds far more than Solaris alone. Across its seas lie:

- **Uncharted Oceans** – Vast and dangerous waters where storms, leviathans, and ancient ruins dwell.
    
- **Other Continents** – Whispers speak of frozen northern kingdoms, southern deserts of glass, and archipelagos where ancient gods walked.
    
- **The Heavens and the Below** – Planes of existence beyond the mortal world, where the divine pantheons wage their eternal wars and mortals draw their magic.
    

For now, Solaris is the **center stage** of the age to come. Yet Aetheria as a whole waits, alive with mysteries, for those daring enough to uncover them.
