# The War of Fractured Dawn

## The Sundering of Light

In the twilight of the Second Age, the world of [[Aetheria]] flourished under the guidance of the [[La Pelu (Sun Swords)]]—divine champions of [[Raythelion]], the Dawnfather. These radiant beings were not merely warriors, but stewards of harmony. They upheld peace, nurtured growth, and served as living conduits of divine will.

But peace is fragile.

[[Vorath the Betrayer]], once a La Pelu of great renown, fell to the whispers of [[Erabose]], the Sovereign of Shadows. Alongside [[Syrith the Shadowed]] and [[Maldran the Deceiver]], he turned against Raythelion and embraced corruption. In exchange for power, they became the first of the [[Shadow Kin]], and the divine order fractured.

The war that followed shattered the La Pelu. Elemental forces raged. Cities burned. Temples fell. The world teetered on the brink of annihilation.

## The Radiant Accord

In the chaos that followed, four La Pelu remained uncorrupted. They were:

- [[Kaleo the Resonant]], bard and diplomat, wielder of the [[Beacon’s Blade]]
- [[Maleko the Crowned Sentinel]], warrior-king, bearer of the [[Heart of the Flame]]
- [[Kekoa the Firebrand]], general and tactician, wearer of the [[Infernal Breeze Gauntlets]]
- [[Rangi the Flame-Seer]], oracle and keeper of the [[Mirror of Ashes]]

Together, they formed the [[Veilcant Guard]], a secretive order sworn to protect the [[Llano]], the Song of Creation. They rallied mortals, elemental spirits, and surviving divine allies into a coalition known as the [[Radiant Accord]].

But for every victory, the Shadow Kin claimed two more. [[Syrith]] sowed paranoia. [[Maldran]] corrupted bloodlines. [[Vorath]] remained hidden, his will carried by monstrous avatars and whispered dreams.

## The Battle of Emberdeep

The first major clash came at the volcanic forge-temple of [[Emberdeep]], where Vorath sought to corrupt the elemental forges and create the [[Unmaker’s Brand]]—a weapon capable of severing divine essence.

The Veilcant Guard stood in defense:

- [[Kekoa the Firebrand]] held the central bridge alone for a full day.
- [[Kaleo the Resonant]] calmed the forge-spirits with the Canticle of Binding.
- [[Thalara of the Emberkin]], a mortal smith-priestess, shattered the half-forged Brand with her life.

The Accord held the forge, but the cost was immense. The forge was sealed, and the war dragged on.

## The Turning of the Flame

The war reached its crescendo at the [[Shattered Vale]], where the ley-lines of the world converged and the Llano still resonated in full.

The Veilcant Guard led the final charge:

- [[Maleko the Crowned Sentinel]] held the line against Vorath’s vanguard.
- [[Kekoa the Firebrand]] led the mortal legions.
- [[Rangi the Flame-Seer]] stood atop the central spire, channeling visions of what must come.
- [[Kaleo the Resonant]] sang the Llano aloud, weaving divine resonance into the battlefield.

The Shadow Kin were broken. Vorath was cast down. But the Llano was now vulnerable.

In the aftermath, the Guard made a pact:

- The Llano would be fractured, its verses hidden across [[Aetheria]].
- The truth of the war would be veiled, to protect future generations.
- Their relics would be sealed in the desert temple of [[Cadens]], known in the old tongue as [[Luakini o le Pese]].

Each relic was bound with a fragment of its bearer’s soul.

## Aftermath: The Age of Silence

To prevent another divine war, the Veilcant Guard founded two knightly orders:

- The [[Order of the Dawnguard]] – protectors of justice and hunters of divine corruption.
- The [[Sentinels of Equilibrium]] – guardians of balance and neutrality.

The world forgot the truth. The La Pelu became feared. The Llano became myth.

The [[Sunken Temple of Cadens]], buried beneath the sands and later submerged beneath the [[Blessed Realm]], became the resting place of the four relics:

- The [[Beacon’s Blade]]
- The [[Heart of the Flame]]
- The [[Mirror of Ashes]]
- The [[Infernal Breeze Gauntlets]]

The Veilcant Guard vanished. Their names faded into legend.

But the flame was never extinguished.

## Prophecy of the Echoing Flame

> “When the flame is fractured and the song is sealed,  
> When kings cast down their crowns and the wind forgets its name,  
> Four shall rise, not as they were, but as they must be.  
> The blade shall sing, the crown shall burn, the mirror shall weep, and the gauntlets shall bind.  
> In the shadow of the Unmaker’s breath, the world shall tremble.  
> Only those who remember why they forgot shall find the path.  
> Only those who sing the silence shall awaken the dawn.”
