## ⚔️ **The Giant Wars**

The Giant Wars were a defining conflict in [[Dwarves|dwarven]] history—an era of blood, stone, and survival. Long before the [[Flaming Retribution]], the [[dwarves]] of [[Ironhold]] faced a rising threat from the [[Giant]] tribes of the north. These towering beings, forged in elemental fury and loyal to [[The Dark Pantheon]] of [[Erabose]], sought dominion over the surface and the deep places of the world.

The [[Giant]]s were not mindless brutes. They were organized, tribal, and devout—worshiping cruel elemental gods and wielding magic that twisted the land itself. Though they allied with [[Vorath the Betrayer]] during [[The War of Fractured Dawn]], their loyalty was never to him. They served only their gods and their own vision of conquest.

The war was long and brutal. Entire [[Dwarves|dwarven]] holds were shattered. Mountains burned. Rivers froze. But the [[Dwarves]] endured. Through unity, sacrifice, and unmatched craftsmanship, they drove the [[Giant]]s to the brink of extinction.

By the end of the Third Age, the [[Giant]]s were believed to be wiped from the face of [[Aetheria]]—scattered, broken, and buried beneath the ruins of their own ambition.

Their temples are silent. Their bones are dust.  
Or so the [[Dwarves]] believe.
