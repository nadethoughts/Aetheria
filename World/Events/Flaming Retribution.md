- **Event Name**: The Flaming Retribution
- **Date**: Approximately one year before the current timeline
- **Location**: Continent of [[Solaris]], primarily affecting [[The Blessed Realm]]
- **Type**: Cataclysmic Event
- **Description**: The Flaming Retribution was a devastating event that brought meteors, flaming debris, and boiling geysers upon [[The Blessed Realm]] and other parts of [[Solaris]], leading to widespread destruction and the collapse of the once-great kingdom.

## **Cause**

### **Divine Prophecy**
- **Prophetic Warnings**: The prophets of [[Raythelion]], the god worshiped by the Blessed Realm, had foretold the impending doom. They warned the inhabitants of the Blessed Realm to repent and change their ways, but their warnings were largely ignored.
- **Divine Judgement**: The Flaming Retribution was believed to be a divine punishment from [[Raythelion]] for the hubris, corruption, and moral decline of [[The Blessed Realm]]. The kingdom had turned from their ways of enlightenment and guidance to oppression and conquest.

## **Events**

### **Meteor Shower**
- **Meteors and Debris**: The event began with a shower of meteors and flaming debris falling from the sky, causing massive fires and widespread destruction across the land.
- **Impact Sites**: Major cities, including [[Lumopolis]], were heavily impacted. Buildings were reduced to rubble, and entire regions were set ablaze.

### **Boiling Geysers**
- **Eruptions**: The ground itself erupted with boiling geysers, spewing scalding water and steam, further devastating the land and adding to the chaos.
- **New Terrain**: These eruptions altered the geography of the land, creating craters filled with boiling water and transforming once-fertile areas into steaming marshlands.

## **Consequences**

### **Destruction of the Blessed Realm**
- **Collapse**: [[The Blessed Realm]], once a powerful and prosperous kingdom, was utterly destroyed. Its cities lay in ruins, and its population was decimated.
- **Loss of Knowledge and Culture**: Much of the kingdom's knowledge, culture, and history was lost in the destruction. Libraries, temples, and cultural artifacts were consumed by the flames and chaos.

### **Survivors**
- **Exodus**: Those who heeded the prophets' warnings and managed to escape the initial devastation fled north, away from the worst of the destruction. They formed new communities, struggling to survive in the aftermath.
- **Remnants**: The surviving inhabitants of [[The Blessed Realm]] now live in scattered settlements, holding onto the remnants of their culture and striving to rebuild.

### **Environmental Impact**
- **Altered Landscape**: The land that was once [[The Blessed Realm]] is now a collection of craters, boiling lakes, and steaming marshes. The fertile plains and rolling hills have been transformed into a harsh and inhospitable environment.
- **Climate Change**: The Flaming Retribution caused significant changes in the local climate, with increased volcanic activity and ash clouds affecting weather patterns.

### **New Beginnings**
- **Rebuilding**: The survivors of the Flaming Retribution are determined to rebuild and create a new society. They carry with them the lessons learned from their ancestors' mistakes, striving to avoid repeating the same errors.
- **Hope and Renewal**: The aftermath of the Flaming Retribution, while devastating, also represents an opportunity for renewal and growth. The survivors see it as a chance to forge a new path, guided by the principles of [[Raythelion]] and the lessons of the past.
