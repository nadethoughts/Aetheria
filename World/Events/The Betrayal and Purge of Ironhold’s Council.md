**Date:** Fourth Age, Year 1 After the [[Flaming Retribution]]  
**Location:** [[Ironhold]], Dwarven Kingdom

### Event Summary
In the aftermath of the [[Flaming Retribution]]—a cataclysm that reshaped the surface of [[Aetheria]]—the dwarven kingdom of [[Ironhold]] sought to reclaim its lost holdings and restore its strength. However, as the dwarves expanded, a hidden threat emerged from within: Grand Regent [[Varric Silvervein]], one of King [[Hargrin Deepmantle]]’s most trusted advisors, secretly allied with the resurgent giant tribes led by [[Grondar Earthcaller]].

Through manipulation, sabotage, and the use of ancient runes blending giant and dwarven magic, Varric orchestrated attacks on dwarven settlements, including the destruction of [[Dagger’s Sheath]] and the capture of its people for elemental rituals. His actions nearly fractured [[Ironhold]] from within, weakening its defenses and sowing distrust among the clans.

The conspiracy was ultimately exposed by a group of independent agents, who presented irrefutable evidence to King Hargrin and the council. Varric was arrested, and a sweeping purge of traitors and collaborators followed. The event marked a turning point for Ironhold, restoring unity and setting the stage for open war against the giants and their elemental allies.

### Lasting Impact on [[Aetheria]]
