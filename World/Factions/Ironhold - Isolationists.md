## ⚒️ Isolationists

**Belief:**  
The Isolationists hold that Ironhold’s survival depends on secrecy, caution, and self-sufficiency. They believe the surface world remains cursed and dangerous after the Flaming Retribution, and that opening the gates invites ruin. The traditions of the ancestors, the strength of the stone, and the safety of the clan come before all else.

**Supporters:**

- Traditionalist clan elders
- Many Stoneguard veterans
- Some Deepforge miners and Deepshiver mystics
- Dwarves who lost kin or faith during the cataclysm

**Methods:**  
Isolationists resist change, expansion, and outside influence. They focus on perfecting Ironhold’s defenses, maintaining ancient rituals, and stockpiling resources. They are wary of outsiders and suspicious of new ideas.

**Typical Saying:**  
“The stone endures. Let the world outside crumble.”
