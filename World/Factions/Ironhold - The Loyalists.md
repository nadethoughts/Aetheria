## 🏰 The Loyalists

**Belief:**  
Loyalists are those who support the king and the royal line above all else. While many are Expansionists, some are Isolationists who believe only the king can keep Ironhold safe. Loyalty, honor, and unity are their guiding principles.

**Supporters:**

- Bramli Stoneguard (Captain of the Guard)
- Baelgrin Deepdelve (High Loremaster)
- Thorek Ironbrow (Royal Blacksmith)
- Many Stoneguard and Runeweaver elders

**Methods:**  
Loyalists work to maintain order, uphold the king’s decrees, and mediate between the other factions. They often serve as the backbone of Ironhold’s defense and tradition.

**Typical Saying:**  
“The king is the heart of the mountain.”
