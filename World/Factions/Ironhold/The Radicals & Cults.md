## 🕯️ The Radicals & Cults

**Belief:**  
Radicals and cultists believe Ironhold must embrace forbidden power or ancient rites to survive. Some seek to awaken old gods, others to overthrow the king or destroy the clans’ grip on society.

### 🏰 Current Status (Post-Cracked Granite)
- **Heightened Activity:** The recent chaos—giant attacks, elemental rituals, and the exposure of Varric Silvervein’s betrayal—has emboldened radical groups and cults. The Hollowed Flame cult, in particular, has grown more active, exploiting fear and uncertainty to recruit new members and pursue dark rituals.
- **Sabotage and Subversion:** Radicals have been implicated in sabotage, manipulation, and the use of forbidden magic. Their actions have contributed to instability within Ironhold, targeting both Expansionist outposts and Loyalist strongholds.
- **Elemental Alliances:** Some cults have sought alliances with the giants and their elemental thralls, believing that only by embracing ancient, destructive powers can Ironhold survive the coming war. Their rituals often mirror those performed by the giants, further blurring the line between internal and external threats.
- **Hunted and Feared:** The exposure of traitors and cultists during the crisis has led to increased crackdowns by Loyalists and Isolationists. Radicals now operate deeper in the shadows, but their influence remains a persistent danger.
