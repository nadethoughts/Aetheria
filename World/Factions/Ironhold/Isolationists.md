## ⚒️ Isolationists
**Belief:**  
The Isolationists hold that Ironhold’s survival depends on secrecy, caution, and self-sufficiency. They believe the surface world remains cursed and dangerous after the Flaming Retribution, and that opening the gates invites ruin. The traditions of the ancestors, the strength of the stone, and the safety of the clan come before all else.

### 🏰 Current Status (Post-Cracked Granite)
- **Vindicated Fears:** The attacks on Dagger’s Sheath and the infiltration of Ironhold’s council by Varric Silvervein have reinforced the Isolationists’ belief that external threats and internal betrayal are ever-present dangers. Their warnings about the risks of expansion and outside influence have gained new traction among dwarves shaken by recent events.
- **Political Resistance:** Isolationists have become more vocal in council debates, urging a return to stricter traditions and greater caution in dealings with outsiders. They blame the Expansionists’ policies for exposing Ironhold to giant attacks and elemental corruption.
- **Defensive Focus:** In response to the crisis, Isolationists have doubled down on fortifying Ironhold’s defenses, maintaining ancient rituals, and stockpiling resources. Their emphasis on secrecy and clan loyalty has led to increased scrutiny of newcomers and reformers.
- **Factional Tensions:** The events of The Cracked Granite have intensified the divide between Isolationists and Expansionists, with each side claiming their approach is essential for Ironhold’s survival.
