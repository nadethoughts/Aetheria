### ⚔️ **The Iron Tide Regiment**

**Formed from the remnants of Penmaris’s old city guard, marines, and mercenaries**, the **Iron Tide Regiment** is the standing defense force of [[New Penmaris]].  
They were once the harbor’s first and last line of defense — patrolling sea walls, escorting trade ships, and manning the city’s watchtowers.  
After the [[Flaming Retribution]], they became **rebuilders and guardians**, charged with holding the city’s walls against storms, raiders, and whatever still crawls from the drowned ruins.

The Iron Tide is **disciplined but weary**, stretched thin and short on supplies. Many of their best soldiers died sealing off the [[Tidewatch Ward]] six months ago.  
Now, with whispers of movement behind the barricades, they’ve sent out a desperate call — not for recruits, but for **specialists and adventurers**.  
The official posting reads:

> “By order of the Iron Tide Regiment:  
> Volunteers of proven courage and skill are called to assist in the reclamation of the Tidewatch Ward.  
> Payment, provisions, and recognition to be granted upon mission completion.  
> Glory to the Reclaimed City.”

If you’d like, I can **rewrite your short introduction** (the one you’ll read to players before character creation) with this update — replacing the council with the Iron Tide Regiment and giving it that grounded, military-driven tone. Would you like me to do that next?
