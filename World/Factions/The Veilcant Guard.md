_“When all is silent, we are the echo. When all is dark, we are the song.”_

The **Veilcant Guard** was the name once borne by your party in a past life—an elite fellowship of La Pelu, mystics, warriors, and stewards chosen to safeguard the most sacred truth in all of Aetheria: the **Llano**, the Song of Creation.

Formed in the twilight years of the Second Age, the Guard was sworn to a singular purpose: to **fracture the Llano**, scattering its verses, melodies, and harmonics across the world in secret repositories, ancient constructs, and mythic vaults. Each fragment was hidden not just in space, but in resonance—requiring heart, memory, and will to retrieve.

The Veilcant Guard did not trust kings, gods, or even themselves with the full truth. Their oath was not to power, but to preservation—so that if ever Aetheria faced annihilation, the true song might be heard again, and used **only by those who remembered why it was hidden**.

The name has long since faded into myth, but echoes remain—in the wind, in ruins, and perhaps... in the blood of those who now walk the world once more.

### 🎭 “The Last Song of the Veilcant Guard”

_As performed by Argail, Herald of Cadens_

> _(As you stand reflecting on what you have seen and heard, Argail steps into the Treasury. His robes shimmer with faint motes of golden light. He raises a hand. His voice is soft, melodic, and heavy with memory.)_

**ARGAIL:**  
Before the Blessed Realm… before Lumopolis… before the world forgot how to sing…  
There was the Second Age.  
And the world still sang.

The Llano flowed through the ley-lines of Aetheria. The gods walked among us. The La Pelu, The Dawnfather's chosen, were stewards of balance and light.

But peace… is a fragile thing.

> _(He pauses. His voice lowers.)_

Vorath.  
He was the brightest of the La Pelu. A tactician. A visionary.  
But he looked into the light… and saw only his own shadow.

He turned to Erabose, the Sovereign of Shadows.  
And with him fell Syrith the Shadowed… Maldran the Deceiver…  
Together, they became the first of the Shadow Kin.

And the War of the Fractured Dawn began.

> _(He steps forward, voice rising with intensity.)_

The heavens burned.  
The Llano trembled.  
And the world… nearly ended.

But from the ashes rose four who did not fall.  
Four who stood when even the gods faltered.

They were the Veilcant Guard.

> _(He gestures to the sword in Alwor's hand.)_

Vaerion the Resonant.  
He did not wield a blade of steel—but of song.  
In the Hall of Echoes, he sang the Beacon’s Blade into being.  
At the Shattered Vale, he climbed the spire of Cadens and sang the Llano aloud.  
His voice turned the tide.  
And when the battle was done, he sealed the blade and whispered:

> (He gives Alwor a cue)
> “Let the truth wait for the world to be ready.”

> _(A pause. A breath.)_

> _(He indicates to crown that Cahir holds.)_

Kaelus, the Crowned Sentinel.  
A king not by blood, but by the will of his people.  
He cast his crown into the forge and reforged it into the Heart of the Flame.  
He led not from a throne, but from the front lines.  
And when the war was won, he placed the circlet on a brass pillar and said:

> (He points to Cahir)
> “We were kings once.  
> But kings must burn away before light can rise again.”

> _(He turns, voice now like wind through stone. Gesturing to the gauntlets the Karsten holds )_

Kaelion the Firebrand.  
A general of paradox—his soul forged in fire, his heart tempered by wind.  
He forged the Infernal Breeze Gauntlets in the volcanic forges of Emberdeep, cooled in a storm summoned by his own breath.  
He held the central bridge alone for a full day.  
And when the battle ended, he placed the gauntlets on the lap of his own statue and whispered:

> (He give a Cue to Karsten)
> “I broke armies with these.  
> But we break nothing today.”

> (nodding to the Mirror in the hand of Simear)
> _(He lowers his voice, reverent now.)_

And Seraphir the Flame-Seer.  
Born of draconic blood and divine spark.  
He crafted the Mirror of Ashes to reflect memory, flame, and fate.  
Through it, he guided the Guard—revealing betrayals before they struck, victories before they were won.  
But when he saw the Third Age—an age of silence and forgetting—he submerged the mirror in the sacred pool and whispered:

> (He indicates Simear)
> “Let none see until the world can understand.”

> _(Argail steps back, arms wide, voice rising like a crescendo.)_

They did not hide the truth.  
They preserved it.  
They did not flee the world.  
They saved it.

And now…  
You stand where they once stood.  
You bear their relics.  
You awaken their memories.  
You walk the path they once walked.

> _(He lowers his voice to a whisper.)_

The world sings again.  
The Llano stirs.  
And the Veilcant Guard…  
has returned.

> _(He bows his head. The silence that follows is not empty—it is full of memory, of promise, of song.)_
