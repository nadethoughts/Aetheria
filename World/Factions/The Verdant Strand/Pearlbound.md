### **The Pearlbound**
The Pearlbound are not living cultists—they are corpses animated by the Pearl’s desperate will to protect itself. When the Tidecutters tore the Pearl from its pedestal and dropped it in the chaos, the artifact unleashed a catastrophic surge of magic. The blast killed everyone in the immediate area instantly. But death was not the end. As consciousness faded, the Pearl reached out, binding the lifeless bodies into its hive mind. Now, these hollow vessels serve as extensions of its power, guardians of the storm’s heart.

---
#### **Origins**
- The initial magical shockwave annihilated soldiers, dockworkers, and pirates near the Pearl.
- Once dead, their bodies were claimed by the Pearl’s influence, reanimated with coral growths and elemental energy.
- This process continues: anyone who dies within Tidewatch Ward is absorbed into the Pearlbound unless their body is destroyed.

---
#### **Appearance**
- Twisted corpses encrusted with coral, barnacles, and glowing blue-green veins.
- Eyes shine with the Pearl’s eerie luminescence, pulsing like a heartbeat.
- Movements are jerky yet purposeful, driven by a singular directive: defend the Pearl.

---
#### **Behavior**
- The Pearlbound do not speak or reason—they act as extensions of the Pearl’s will.
- They attack intruders without hesitation, growing more aggressive the closer one gets to the Pearl’s resting place.
- Their numbers swell as the ward claims more victims, creating an ever-growing army of the dead.

---
#### **Abilities**
- **Hive Mind Coordination:** Perfectly synchronized attacks, as if guided by one consciousness.
- **Coral Armor:** Hardened growths grant natural resilience.
- **Pearl’s Call:** Prolonged exposure to the Pearl’s aura risks mental corruption—living beings may hear whispers urging surrender.

---
#### **Goals**
- Protect the Pearl at all costs.
- Expand their ranks by claiming every fallen body in the ward.
- Maintain the sanctity of the Gloamways, now a graveyard and fortress combined.

---
#### **Faction Hooks**
- **Horror:** The party may recognize faces among the Pearlbound—fallen soldiers, lost refugees, or even former allies.
- **Urgency:** Destroying bodies after combat becomes critical to prevent reinforcements.
- **Choice:** Will the party risk lingering near the Pearl, knowing death means eternal servitude?
