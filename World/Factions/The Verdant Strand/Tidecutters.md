The Tidecutters are a ruthless pirate brotherhood that rose from the chaos following the **Flaming Retribution**. Once scattered raiders haunting the southern coasts, they have become a disciplined and dangerous force, united under a single banner and driven by ambition. Their name is whispered in fear across the Shimmering Shores and now, ominously, in the streets of **New Penmaris**.

---
#### **Origins & Reputation**
- Before the cataclysm, the Tidecutters were opportunistic smugglers and raiders operating from hidden coves and black-market ports.
- The destruction of Old Penmaris and the collapse of trade routes gave them new purpose: seize control of maritime commerce and exploit the chaos.
- Known for their brutality and cunning, they never take prisoners alive and leave their mark in blood and fire.

---
#### **Leadership**
- **Captain [[Garrick Tidebreaker]]**: A charismatic and merciless leader, famed for his iron will and unmatched seamanship. Garrick’s philosophy is simple: _“The sea belongs to those bold enough to claim it.”_
- **Bosun [[Reddan Pike]]**: Quartermaster and enforcer, feared for his cruelty and skill with blade and rope. Reddan ensures loyalty through terror and reward.

---
#### **Goals & Motives**
- The Tidecutters seek dominance over the [[Verdant Strand]]’s shipping lanes and control of key ports.
- Their current obsession: the **Pearl**, a legendary artifact hidden beneath Tidewatch Ward. They believe it can grant power over the sea itself.
- To reach the Pearl, they orchestrate chaos—summoning storms, spreading fear, and sabotaging reconstruction efforts.

---
#### **Methods & Tactics**
- Use sabotage and psychological warfare: graffiti, coded messages, and staged “hauntings” to keep locals away.
- Employ mutated beasts and mercenaries, rumored to have struck bargains with dark forces.
- Operate from **[[Blackfin Isle]]**, a jagged fortress island southeast of [[New Penmaris]], bristling with hidden docks and pirate strongholds.

---
#### **Symbols & Culture**
- Their emblem: a jagged anchor entwined with a serpent, painted in crimson on sails and scrawled on walls.
- Tidecutter crews prize audacity and loyalty; betrayal is punished by drowning or worse.
- Superstitions run deep—many believe the Pearl is their destiny, a gift from the sea gods.
