![[Iron Tide Regiment.png]]
The Iron Tide Regiment is the primary military force of **New Penmaris**, tasked with defending the city’s walls, maintaining order in its crowded wards, and safeguarding its harbors against threats from both land and sea. Formed during the desperate months following the **[[Flaming Retribution]]**, the regiment embodies resilience and discipline in a city struggling to survive.

---
#### **Origins & Purpose**
- Established after the catastrophic destruction of Old Penmaris, when the peninsula was shattered and the city rebuilt on an island.
- Initially a coalition of surviving soldiers, sailors, and mercenaries, unified under a single command to repel monsters and enforce stability.
- Today, the regiment serves as both **city guard** and **standing army**, with specialized units for naval defense and urban security.

---
#### **Structure**
- **Command:** Led by a seasoned captain and overseen by the city council’s military liaison.
- **Ranks:** Standard hierarchy of officers, sergeants, and enlisted soldiers, with elite squads known as **Wavebreakers** for high-risk missions.
- **Specialists:** Includes scryers for magical reconnaissance, engineers for ward fortifications, and beast-hunters trained to combat mutated creatures.

---
#### **Duties**
- Patrol the city’s perimeter and maintain the magical wards sealing **Tidewatch Ward**.
- Respond to internal unrest in refugee camps and enforce council decrees.
- Escort supply convoys and protect merchant shipping lanes from pirates.
- Deploy adventuring parties when conventional forces cannot risk further losses.

---
#### **Resources & Tactics**
- Equipped with heavy armor, halberds, and crossbows for urban combat.
- Use rune-marked tokens for tracking operatives and magical sending stones for communication.
- Known for their **“Hold the Line”** doctrine—prioritizing defense and containment over reckless assaults.

---
#### **Current Challenges**
- Severely understrength after repeated failed attempts to reclaim Tidewatch Ward.
- Morale strained by mounting casualties and the growing influence of rival factions like the **[[Tidecutters]]** pirates and the **[[Stormcallers]]** cult.
- Increasing reliance on independent adventurers to achieve objectives the regiment can no longer handle directly.
