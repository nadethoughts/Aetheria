### **The Dockhand Golems**

When the Pearl was torn from its pedestal, its unleashed magic rippled through Tidewatch Ward, awakening more than storms and monsters. Among the ward’s shattered docks, the enchanted constructs once used for heavy lifting and cargo hauling gained sentience. These **Dockhand Golems**, forged for labor, now guard the waterfront with unwavering resolve—and a deep mistrust of all outsiders.

---
#### **Origins**
- Originally created as tireless dock workers, powered by minor enchantments and bound to simple commands.
- The Pearl’s surge of magic shattered those bindings, granting them awareness, autonomy, and a singular instinct: protect the docks.
- Their awakening coincided with the ward’s collapse, leaving them isolated and hostile to any who approach.

---
#### **Appearance & Traits**
- Towering figures of iron and barnacle-crusted wood, their frames reinforced with chains and rusted gears.
- Coral growths and glowing runes pulse faintly across their bodies—a lingering echo of the Pearl’s magic.
- Their voices are grinding echoes of metal on stone, rarely used except to issue warnings before violence.

---
#### **Behavior & Culture**
- The Dockhand Golems see themselves as guardians of the ward’s maritime lifeblood.
- They distrust all outsiders—human, pirate, or monster—and enforce their own law: _“No trespass. No theft. No harm to the docks.”_
- Communication is minimal; their creed is action. They shoot first and ask questions later if anyone nears the waterfront.

---
#### **Goals**
- Preserve the docks from destruction or looting.
- Prevent the Pearl—or any artifact tied to the storm—from leaving the ward.
- Maintain what remains of their domain, even as the sea and fog reclaim it.

---
#### **Methods**
- Patrol the ruined piers in squads, armed with harpoon launchers, chain nets, and crushing strength.
- Use the ward’s geography to their advantage—ambushes from cranes, collapsing gangways, and barricades of cargo crates.
- Execute intruders swiftly, leaving their bodies as warnings.

---
#### **Faction Hooks**
- **Conflict:** The Dockhand Golems stand between the party and critical objectives—hidden caches, Coralite deposits, or routes into the Gloamways.
- **Diplomacy:** They are not mindless; a clever negotiator might exploit their rigid logic or appeal to their sense of duty.
- **Mystery:** Some golems bear fragments of old commands etched into their plating—clues to forgotten secrets of the ward.
