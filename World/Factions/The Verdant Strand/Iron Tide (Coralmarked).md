### **The Coralmarked**
The Coralmarked are surviving members of the Iron Tide Regiment who endured the chaos of Tidewatch Ward—but not unchanged. Prolonged exposure to the Pearl’s unleashed magic fused coral and barnacles into their flesh, leaving them visibly mutated yet fully conscious. Mistaken for monsters, they were abandoned by their own and forced to carve out a life in the drowned ruins. Now, they cling to their sense of duty and offer wary alliance to those who seek to reclaim the ward.

---
#### **Origins**
- When the Pearl’s surge devastated Tidewatch Ward, many Iron Tide soldiers died instantly. Others survived, fighting for days in the mist.
- The longer they remained, the deeper the mutation: coral grafts hardened across their skin, veins glowed faintly blue-green.
- Branded as abominations, they were cut off from the city and left to fend for themselves.

---
#### **Appearance**
- Humanoids with jagged coral plates fused to their arms, shoulders, and faces.
- Barnacle clusters cling to armor, and faint bioluminescent streaks trace their veins.
- Their uniforms are tattered but still bear the Iron Tide crest—a haunting reminder of loyalty.

---
#### **Behavior**
- Retain their minds, discipline, and tactical skill.
- Distrustful of outsiders at first, but willing to negotiate if convinced of shared goals.
- Fiercely protective of their sanctuaries and each other.

---
#### **Role in the Campaign**
- **Ally Faction:** The Coralmarked can provide safe havens for short rests, caches of supplies, and intelligence on rival factions.
- **Information Brokers:** They know the ward’s layout, the locations of cult rituals, pirate caches, and Pearlbound activity.
- **Conditional Trust:** Their help comes with a warning—the longer the party remains in the ward, the greater the risk of developing similar mutations.

---
#### **Hooks**
- **Moral Dilemma:** PCs may begin to show early signs of coral grafting—how far will they go to finish the mission?
- **Shared Enemy:** The Coralmarked despise the Tidecutters and Stormcallers, offering aid in exchange for strikes against them.
- **Personal Connection:** Some Coralmarked may recognize PCs from past service, deepening the emotional stakes.
