### **The Namar'Zul – Seekers of the Divine Trail**

The **Namar'Zul** are a nomadic tribe of [[Tripkee]] bound to the divine calling of **[[Uhlvara]]**, the Seeker in the Wilds. Known for their relentless pursuit of elusive prey and hidden truths, the Namar'Zul wander the shifting lands and seas of [[Aetheria]], ever guided by the glimmer of [[The Rank of Guiding Luminecence|the Guiding Luminescence]]. Unlike other [[Tripkee]] tribes, they do not make their homes in marshes or hollowed trees, but instead atop the shell of a **titanic sea turtle** known as **[[Oloru]]**, the Shellborn Sentinel.

Gifted to the Namar'Zul by [[Uhlvara]] himself generations ago, **[[Oloru]]** is a living sanctuary and symbol of divine favor. His back bears a mossy forest, herbal gardens, and homes crafted from bone and driftwood. It is said his eyes reflect the stars of every sky he has seen, and he knows the paths through hidden currents and ancient ley lines lost to time.

The Namar'Zul escaped the horrors of the [[Flaming Retribution]] by mere fate, as [[Oloru]] glided through safer seas. Now, they reside in a **volatile swamp**, its waters near boiling, brimming with elemental danger and dark corruption. Here, they face off against **giant flora and insects**, the **twisted [[Goblin#Fire Walker Tribe|Firewalker Tribe]]** and their **hag mistresses**, the monstrous **[[Grul’Mog the Deep Belly (Froghemoth)]]**, and roaming **undead spirits** displaced from ruined [[Lumopolis]].

Yet the Namar'Zul endure, living not in fear but in purpose. To them, every threat is a signpost on the divine trail — a challenge set by [[Uhlvara]] to guide them toward a greater revelation.
