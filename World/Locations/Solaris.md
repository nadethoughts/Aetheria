## The World of Solaris: A Land of Six Regions

Welcome to the continent of **Solaris**, a land divided into six distinct regions, each with its own unique inhabitants and landscapes.

## **[[Ironhold]]**

Located in the northwest, this is the domain of the Dwarves. Known for their unyielding spirit, mastery over stone and metal, and profound magical aptitude, the Dwarves have carved out a formidable realm that stands as a testament to their strength, craftsmanship, and arcane mastery.

## **[[Luminael]]**

The western forests, shrouded in mystery, are home to the Elves. Behind the majestic **[[Emeraldine Mountains]]** lies **[[Luminael]]**, a land where natural psychics and psionic practitioners commune with the world through the mind and spirit rather than traditional magic. The Elves’ abilities are rooted in perception, intuition, and mental discipline, reflecting their connection to the psychic currents of Aetheria.

## **[[The Blessed Realm]]**

To the south lies the **Blessed Realm**, a monarchy that shines as a beacon of order and grace. Ruled by a sovereign monarch, this realm extends its influence over **the Sunlit Plains**, ensuring peace and prosperity across the continent.

## **[[The Free Cities of the Vale]]**

At the heart of Aetheria are the **[[Free Cities of the Vale]]**. This region is a melting pot of cultures, where various races coexist in a network of thriving city-states, each with its own governance and customs.

## **[[The Shimmering Shores]]**

The eastern coastline, known as **[[The Shimmering Shores]]**, boasts some of the busiest ports in all of [[Aetheria]]. Here, merchants from distant lands mingle with local traders, creating a vibrant tapestry of commerce and exchange.

## **[[Verdant Strand]]**

The **Verdant Strand** stretches along the northern coast of Solaris, featuring **rocky cliffs, pine-covered hills, and sheltered bays**. Rebuilt after the upheavals of the Flaming Retribution, the region is a hub of **resilient mercantile towns**, small harbors, and forested settlements. Its inhabitants are practical, industrious, and community-oriented, balancing seafaring, trade, and forest livelihoods.

The Verdant Strand is defined by **temperate forests, rolling hills, and rugged shorelines**, with winters that are brisk and summers mild. Merchant guilds, coastal lords, and adventurers vie for influence in its ports, while offshore islands and hidden coves promise both peril and treasure for those daring enough to explore.

This northern coastal region stands as a testament to **resilience, maritime skill, and quiet ambition**, offering adventurers opportunities for trade, exploration, and intrigue along Solaris’s rocky shores.
