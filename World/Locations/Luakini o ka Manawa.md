# Legend of the Temple
Let it be known, the Luakini o ka Manawa Temple, erected in the desolate expanse of the desert, was consecrated as the dwelling place of this hallowed device. Here, in this sanctified ground, time is both revered and safeguarded. The Time Turner, a beacon of temporal equilibrium, extends its divine influence beyond the temple’s sacred walls, a testament to the boundless grace of [[Shananooah]]. In the holy scriptures, it is recorded that [[The Great Time Turner]] is protected by potent enchantments and the unwavering devotion of [[Shananooah]]’s most faithful.

Thus, the legend endures, enshrined in the hearts of the faithful. [[The Great Time Turner]], a testament to the divine order of time, stands as a reminder of [[Shananooah]]’s eternal guidance. It is written that time is both a divine gift and a holy charge, guiding the world in its endless dance through the ages, under the watchful gaze of the Goddess of Time and Space.
