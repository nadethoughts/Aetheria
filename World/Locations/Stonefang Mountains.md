## 🏔️ Stonefang Mountains

The **Stonefang Mountains** are a vast, ancient range dominating the northwest of Solaris. Their jagged peaks and sheer cliffs rise like the broken teeth of some primordial beast, shrouded in perpetual mist and battered by fierce winds. The mountains are rich in iron, gold, and rare crystals, their roots honeycombed with tunnels, natural caverns, and the legendary [[Dwarves|dwarven]] stronghold of [[Ironhold]].

Legends say the Stonefangs were shaped in the dawn of the world by the gods of earth and fire, and their bones still hum with elemental power. The slopes are treacherous—strewn with scree, choked with pine forests, and riddled with hidden passes known only to the dwarves. Glacial rivers carve deep valleys, and ancient ruins from the Giant Wars dot the high passes, silent reminders of battles long past.

For centuries, the Stonefang Mountains have been both shield and prison for the [[Dwarves]] of [[Ironhold]]. During the Flaming Retribution, their deep halls protected the dwarven people from the fires that swept the surface. Now, as [[Ironhold]]’s gates open once more, the Stonefangs stand as both a barrier to the unknown and a gateway to reclaiming lost glory.

**Key Features:**

- **[[Ironhold]]:** The greatest dwarven city, carved deep into the heart of the range.
- **Hidden Passes:** Secret trails and tunnels, some lost to memory, others fiercely guarded.
- **Ruins of the [[Giant Wars]]:** Crumbling fortresses, toppled statues, and battlefields haunted by old magic.
- **Elemental Disturbances:** Leylines and natural springs that sometimes surge with strange energies, especially since the Flaming Retribution.

**Atmosphere:**  
The Stonefangs are a place of danger and beauty—echoing with the clang of forges, the howl of mountain winds, and the distant rumble of avalanches. To the dwarves, they are both ancestral homeland and living legend: a place where every stone remembers, and every shadow may hide a secret.
