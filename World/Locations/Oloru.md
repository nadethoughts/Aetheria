### **Oloru, the Shellborn Sentinel**

**Oloru** is a colossal sea turtle, ancient beyond reckoning, and a sacred gift from **[[Uhlvara]], the Seeker in the Wilds**. He is both sanctuary and guardian to the **[[Namar'Zul]]**, bearing their people on his mossy, forested shell as he travels the waters and skies of [[Aetheria]]. His slow movements conceal deep wisdom and immense power, and though he is at home beneath the waves, **when the world needs him most — he flies**.

### **The Wings of the Hunt**

Legends speak of the moment during the **[[Flaming Retribution]]** when fire rained from the heavens and the seas boiled. The [[Tripkee]] cried out to [[Uhlvara]] — and Oloru answered.

With a deep, thunderous bellow that split the storm, Oloru's limbs shimmered with celestial light. Massive, glowing **fins expanded like wings**, unfurling from his body with the grace of an eclipse. Lifting into the air, **he soared**, bearing the [[Namar'Zul]] out of the dying sea and into the sheltering arms of the sky.

Since that day, the [[Namar'Zul]] revere his **Flightform** as a holy mystery — a hidden power awakened only in dire times, when fate itself turns against them.

### **Traits and Divine Abilities (Flavorful)**

- **Flightform (Divine Gift):** Oloru can call upon [[Uhlvara]]’s blessing to take to the skies. In this state, his fins glow with radiant energy, and he leaves behind a trail of stardust and sea mist. He only flies when threatened, or when following signs from [[Uhlvara]].
- **Sky-and-Sea Bond:** Oloru feels the pulse of both ocean and air currents. His instincts lead him to places of power, danger, or destiny — an extension of [[Uhlvara]]’s domain.
- **Shelled Worldwalker:** As he soars, the [[Namar'Zul]] see a vision of a world untouched by shadow — a glimpse of the Hunt’s truest path.
