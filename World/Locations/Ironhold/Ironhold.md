## 🏔️ Ironhold – The Last Great Bastion
Carved into the heart of the Stonefang Mountains, Ironhold is more than a city—it is a fortress, a forge, and a legacy. Its halls stretch deep beneath the earth, layered like the rings of a tree, each level older and more sacred than the last. The outer gates are carved with the names of every king who has ruled since the First Age, and the inner sanctums glow with the light of rune-lanterns and molten forges.

### 🏰 Structure & Districts
Ironhold is divided into clan districts, each with its own architecture, traditions, and banners:
- **Deepforge:** Masters of mining and metallurgy, their forges fuel Ironhold’s industry and defense.
- **Runeweaver:** Scholars and artificers, preserving dwarven history and unlocking the secrets of ancient runes and leyline magic.
- **Stoneguard:** Elite warriors and royal protectors, the shield of Ironhold.
- **Hollowbrand:** Traders and bankers, controlling wealth and commerce.
- **Blackshard:** Spies and informants, dealing in secrets and shadow operations.
- **Deepshiver:** Mystics and spiritual guides, keepers of ancient rituals and prophecy.
- **Ironmark:** Scouts and rangers, guardians of the mountain’s edges and eyes beyond the stone.
- **Geargrind:** Engineers and machinists, builders of the machines that keep Ironhold running.

### 👑 The Throne of Stone
At the city’s heart lies the Throne of Stone, where King Hargrin Deepmantle rules. His court is a place of tension and tradition, where ancient oaths and modern ambitions collide. The recent events of The Cracked Granite have heightened these tensions, as the exposure of Varric Silvervein’s betrayal and the threat of giant invasion have forced the clans to confront both old rivalries and new alliances.

### 🛡️ Resilience & Legacy
Ironhold is a place of resilience. It withstood the Flaming Retribution, remembers the Giant Wars, and now faces a new era of uncertainty and opportunity. Its gates are open once more, but the scars of betrayal and war run deep. The city’s defenses have been tested, its leadership challenged, and its people forced to choose between tradition and progress.
