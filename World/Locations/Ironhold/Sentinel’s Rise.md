### 🏰 Campaign Events & Significance
- **Suspicious Lockdown:** Sentinel’s Rise went silent after receiving a suspicious lockdown order from Grand Regent Varric Silvervein. The order instructed the watchtower to cease communications and remain isolated, a highly irregular command that raised concerns of internal betrayal and sabotage.
- **Signs of Betrayal:** The party’s investigation revealed documents confirming Varric’s involvement in the lockdown, further exposing the regent’s conspiracy against Ironhold.
- **Elemental Assault:** Upon arrival, the party found Sentinel’s Rise heavily damaged—assaulted by elemental forces, trolls, and an unidentified hairy creature. The destruction bore signs of raw elemental energy rather than conventional siege tactics, indicating the giants’ use of elemental magic and thralls in their attacks.
- **Rescue & Communication:** Survivors at the watchtower were found unconscious, and the party sent word back to Hammergate Hold before continuing toward Ironhold, ensuring that the evidence of betrayal and the nature of the assault were relayed to the kingdom’s defenders.
