## 🏔️ Stonefang Mountains
The **Stonefang Mountains** are a vast, ancient range dominating the northwest of Solaris. Their jagged peaks and sheer cliffs rise like the broken teeth of some primordial beast, shrouded in perpetual mist and battered by fierce winds. The mountains are rich in iron, gold, and rare crystals, their roots honeycombed with tunnels, natural caverns, and the legendary dwarven stronghold of Ironhold.

### 🧑‍🎓 Historical & Mythic Significance
- **Elemental Origins:** Legends say the Stonefangs were shaped in the dawn of the world by the gods of earth and fire, and their bones still hum with elemental power. The region is marked by leylines and natural springs that surge with strange energies, especially since the Flaming Retribution.
- **Giant Wars Legacy:** Ancient ruins from the Giant Wars dot the high passes—crumbling fortresses, toppled statues, and battlefields haunted by old magic. These ruins serve as reminders of the long conflict between dwarves and giants, and are often sites of adventure, danger, and discovery.
- **Shield and Prison:** For centuries, the Stonefang Mountains have been both shield and prison for the dwarves of Ironhold. During the Flaming Retribution, their deep halls protected the dwarven people from the fires that swept the surface. Now, as Ironhold’s gates open once more, the Stonefangs stand as both a barrier to the unknown and a gateway to reclaiming lost glory.
