Hammergate Hold is a dwarven frontier watchtower in _The Cracked Granite_ campaign. It serves as the first major stronghold the party reaches after escaping the ogre warcamp with 21 rescued dwarves. Strategically positioned in the mountains, Hammergate Hold is a military outpost tasked with monitoring the northern passes and coordinating defense along Ironhold’s border.

It is commanded by **Captain Thrain Emberhelm**, a seasoned and pragmatic dwarven officer who quickly recognizes the seriousness of the party’s report. Hammergate Hold is not a full military installation, but it is equipped with sending stones for communication, a small garrison, and enough supplies to support refugees and mount a limited defense.

The party’s arrival at Hammergate Hold marks a turning point in the campaign, as they transition from survival to investigation, and begin uncovering the deeper political and military threats facing Ironhold.
