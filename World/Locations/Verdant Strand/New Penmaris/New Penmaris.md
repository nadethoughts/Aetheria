## **New Penmaris**

_The Pearl of the Verdant Strand_

### Overview

Once the pride of the Verdant Strand, the city of **Penmaris** stood atop a sprawling peninsula, its harbors bustling with trade and its streets lined with stately mansions belonging to powerful merchant barons. Known as the jewel of the northern coast, Penmaris boasted the strongest navy in the region and a vibrant mercantile culture that drew travelers, diplomats, and adventurers alike.

The **Flaming Retribution** changed everything. The peninsula that supported the city was shattered, leaving the proud metropolis stranded on what is now a rugged island just offshore. Despite this cataclysm, the citizens of Penmaris refused to yield. Within a generation, they rebuilt their city from the ruins, christening it **New Penmaris**, a symbol of resilience and unbroken ambition.

### Geography

New Penmaris rests on a rocky island, its coastline battered by wind and waves but fortified with strong stone walls and towers. Natural harbors provide safe refuge for trade ships and the city’s renowned navy. Bridges and causeways link smaller outlying islets, allowing the city to maintain its traditional maritime dominance despite its altered geography.

The island’s cliffs rise sharply from the sea, providing vantage points for defense and observation. Inland, terraced districts climb toward the old citadel, now rebuilt and reinforced, serving as a reminder of the city’s enduring spirit.

### Culture and Economy

New Penmaris remains the mercantile heart of the northern Verdant Strand. Its merchant barons wield influence both locally and across the eastern trade routes, and the city thrives on commerce, shipbuilding, and skilled craftsmanship. Markets overflow with exotic goods from distant lands, while guilds regulate trade, navigation, and shipwrighting with meticulous care.

Despite the disaster, the city has cultivated a culture of pride, perseverance, and opportunism. Festivals celebrating the sea, trade, and maritime history are held year-round, and tales of survival and heroic rebuilding are told to every newcomer.

### Governance

New Penmaris is ruled by a council of merchant lords, with the admiral of the navy holding a permanent seat as a protector of the city. Decisions are made through debate, negotiation, and the careful weighing of influence, ensuring that commerce and defense remain the twin pillars of governance.

### Physical State

- **Reconstruction in Progress:** The city has been rebuilt quickly, but much of it still shows signs of hurried reconstruction. Wooden scaffolds and temporary structures line some streets. Stonework is solid in key areas (the citadel, harbor defenses, main guild halls), but residential districts have a patchwork feel.
- **Unstable Terrain:** The former peninsula’s destruction left the island with jagged cliffs, partially collapsed docks, and some areas prone to landslides or erosion. Certain coastal districts are still off-limits as engineers work to reinforce them.
- **Harbor & Navy:** The Grand Harbor is operational, but shipyards are working overtime to replace lost vessels. Naval patrols are constant, partly to protect trade and partly to reassure citizens that the city remains safe despite its exposed position.

### Society & Economy

- **Thriving but Tense:** Merchants and guilds are back in business, and trade has resumed, though shipping routes remain cautious due to remaining debris and unpredictable currents. Prices for goods are high because supply chains are strained.
- **Rebuilding Pride:** Citizens are proud of how quickly New Penmaris has returned to the sea, but there’s an undercurrent of anxiety. People remember the disaster vividly, and rumors of “aftershocks” or lingering magical effects circulate.
- **Population Shifts:** Many refugees from smaller coastal towns moved to New Penmaris, swelling its population. Temporary camps outside the city hold those still waiting for permanent housing.

### Governance & Politics

- **Council of Merchant Lords:** The city council governs firmly, emphasizing commerce and security. Power struggles between ambitious merchants are common, as some see the disaster as an opportunity to rise.
- **Military Readiness:** The city’s navy and local militia are on high alert. Pirates, smugglers, and opportunistic raiders exploit the chaos in the aftermath.
