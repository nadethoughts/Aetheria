## **New Penmaris**

_The Pearl of the Verdant Strand_

### Overview

Once the pride of the Verdant Strand, the city of **Penmaris** stood atop a sprawling peninsula, its harbors bustling with trade and its streets lined with stately mansions belonging to powerful merchant barons. Known as the jewel of the northern coast, Penmaris boasted the strongest navy in the region and a vibrant mercantile culture that drew travelers, diplomats, and adventurers alike.

The **Flaming Retribution** changed everything. The peninsula that supported the city was shattered, leaving the proud metropolis stranded on what is now a rugged island just offshore. Despite this cataclysm, the citizens of Penmaris refused to yield. Within a generation, they rebuilt their city from the ruins, christening it **New Penmaris**, a symbol of resilience and unbroken ambition.

### Geography

New Penmaris rests on a rocky island, its coastline battered by wind and waves but fortified with strong stone walls and towers. Natural harbors provide safe refuge for trade ships and the city’s renowned navy. Bridges and causeways link smaller outlying islets, allowing the city to maintain its traditional maritime dominance despite its altered geography.

The island’s cliffs rise sharply from the sea, providing vantage points for defense and observation. Inland, terraced districts climb toward the old citadel, now rebuilt and reinforced, serving as a reminder of the city’s enduring spirit.

### Culture and Economy

New Penmaris remains the mercantile heart of the northern Verdant Strand. Its merchant barons wield influence both locally and across the eastern trade routes, and the city thrives on commerce, shipbuilding, and skilled craftsmanship. Markets overflow with exotic goods from distant lands, while guilds regulate trade, navigation, and shipwrighting with meticulous care.

Despite the disaster, the city has cultivated a culture of pride, perseverance, and opportunism. Festivals celebrating the sea, trade, and maritime history are held year-round, and tales of survival and heroic rebuilding are told to every newcomer.

### Governance

New Penmaris is ruled by a council of merchant lords, with the admiral of the navy holding a permanent seat as a protector of the city. Decisions are made through debate, negotiation, and the careful weighing of influence, ensuring that commerce and defense remain the twin pillars of governance.

### Key Features

- **The Rebuilt Citadel:** A heavily fortified stronghold perched at the highest point of the island, symbolizing the city’s resilience.
- **Grand Harbor:** Deep-water docks that accommodate merchant ships and naval vessels alike.
- **Market of Tides:** A sprawling marketplace where traders from across Solaris convene.
- **The Lighthouse of Renewal:** A towering beacon that guides ships safely to port, also a monument to the city’s survival.

### Adventure Hooks

- Smugglers and pirates exploit the channel waters surrounding New Penmaris, threatening the city’s trade and security.
- The island’s unstable cliffs hide ancient ruins from the old peninsula, holding treasures and secrets lost to the Flaming Retribution.
- A merchant baron seeks daring adventurers to retrieve a stolen cargo that could shift the balance of power in the city.

## **New Penmaris: One Year After the Flaming Retribution**

### Physical State

- **Reconstruction in Progress:** The city has been rebuilt quickly, but much of it still shows signs of hurried reconstruction. Wooden scaffolds and temporary structures line some streets. Stonework is solid in key areas (the citadel, harbor defenses, main guild halls), but residential districts have a patchwork feel.
- **Unstable Terrain:** The former peninsula’s destruction left the island with jagged cliffs, partially collapsed docks, and some areas prone to landslides or erosion. Certain coastal districts are still off-limits as engineers work to reinforce them.
- **Harbor & Navy:** The Grand Harbor is operational, but shipyards are working overtime to replace lost vessels. Naval patrols are constant, partly to protect trade and partly to reassure citizens that the city remains safe despite its exposed position.

### Society & Economy

- **Thriving but Tense:** Merchants and guilds are back in business, and trade has resumed, though shipping routes remain cautious due to remaining debris and unpredictable currents. Prices for goods are high because supply chains are strained.
- **Rebuilding Pride:** Citizens are proud of how quickly New Penmaris has returned to the sea, but there’s an undercurrent of anxiety. People remember the disaster vividly, and rumors of “aftershocks” or lingering magical effects circulate.
- **Population Shifts:** Many refugees from smaller coastal towns moved to New Penmaris, swelling its population. Temporary camps outside the city hold those still waiting for permanent housing.

### Governance & Politics

- **Council of Merchant Lords:** The city council governs firmly, emphasizing commerce and security. Power struggles between ambitious merchants are common, as some see the disaster as an opportunity to rise.
- **Military Readiness:** The city’s navy and local militia are on high alert. Pirates, smugglers, and opportunistic raiders exploit the chaos in the aftermath.

### Culture & Morale

- **Festivals & Public Works:** Public celebrations of the city’s survival occur frequently, both to boost morale and remind citizens of their resilience. Temporary monuments commemorate the disaster and honor those lost.
- **Rumors & Mysteries:** Strange occurrences—ships vanishing near submerged cliffs, unexplained currents, odd sea creatures—feed tales of lingering magic from the Flaming Retribution, intriguing adventurers.

### Adventure Hooks in This Context

- A merchant baron hires adventurers to recover valuable cargo from the rubble of the old peninsula now submerged offshore.
- Citizens report strange, glowing fissures along the island’s cliffs, possibly linked to residual magical energy from the Flaming Retribution.
- Refugees from destroyed settlements are arriving with dire warnings of threats that could strike the city, giving the PCs reason to investigate.
- Pirate or monster attacks on the busy harbor increase tensions, requiring adventurers to protect the city’s trade

## 🗺️ **Layout of New Penmaris — The Island City**
**New Penmaris** stands on the last surviving island of the old peninsula — a broken crescent of land rising from the sea. The coastline is jagged, the docks ring the lower edge, and the rebuilt city climbs gradually toward the cliffs at the island’s heart.

Here’s how the wards connect:

---
### ⚓ **The Docks & Breakwater** – _Southern Edge_
The lowest part of the city, pressed against the sea. Ships crowd the harbors, and cranes haul cargo to higher ground.

- Connects **north** to the **Driftward** and **Maker’s Ward**.
- Guarded by detachments of the **Iron Tide Regiment**.
- Constantly loud, wet, and full of life.

---
### 🪶 **The Driftward** – _Southwest Slopes_
A sprawl of tents, inns, and half-built homes climbing up from the docks. It’s the beating heart of the city’s common folk.

- Borders the **Maker’s Ward** to the east and **Founders’ Rise** uphill to the north.
- Floods easily during high tide or heavy rain.
- Streets twist around scaffolds, alleys, and hanging laundry — confusing but full of opportunity.

---
### ⚒️ **The Maker’s Ward** – _Central and Eastern Rise_
The industrial spine of New Penmaris. Foundries, shipyards, and carpenters dominate the skyline with black smoke and hammer-song.

- Links the **Driftward** and **Docks** to the **Tidewatch Ward** on the island’s easternmost point.
- The **Iron Tide Regiment’s barracks** and supply depots sit here, close to the barricaded wall.
- The most fortified and heavily trafficked district.

---
### 🌊 **The Tidewatch Ward** – _Eastern Tip, Beyond the Wall_
Once the proud seawall district — now sealed, flooded, and cursed. The only access is through **the Iron Gate**, guarded day and night.

- Beyond it lies the open sea and the shattered ruins of Old Penmaris, visible as dark shapes beneath the waves.
- Storm clouds linger overhead; the air hums faintly with strange energy.
- Few who enter ever return.

---
### 🧱 **The Founders’ Rise** – _Northern Heights_
The island’s highest ground, a fortified plateau where the city’s leaders, guilds, and temples have gathered during the rebuilding.

- Overlooks the entire city — the docks below, the wall of Tidewatch beyond.
- Connected by elevated walkways and terraces to both the **Maker’s Ward** and **Driftward**.
- The most stable terrain on the island, but not without its politics and rivalries.

---
### 🔮 **The Luminous Quarter** – _Northwest Cliffside & Old Foundations_
Perched near the ruins of Old Penmaris’s arcane district, it glows faintly at night from residual magic.

- Borders **Founders’ Rise** and partially slopes toward the **Driftward**.
