## Back Story

# What group of workers or refugees did you protect when a half-finished district collapsed during rebuilding?
Helped protect the shipwrights shortly after the [[Flaming Retribution]] to bring help build fishing boats to keep people fed. There were aftershock fire raining and built a shield to protect them. (patent pending)

# You worked side by side rescuing survivors from a capsized ferry near the harbor mouth. Whose quick thinking saved the most lives, and how did you celebrate after?
[[Lil John]] was able to disassemble the mast and use it as a bridge to help the people across to dry shore. While [[Xander 'Floodbringer']] provided light for the people to walk to in the dark and provided healing for those who needed medical care.

[[Lil John]] and [[Xander 'Floodbringer']] Celebrated their rescue of the ferry by going to the [[Sunken Shore Saloon]] and drinking the night away. [[Lil John]] discovered that not only is Xander reserved, but he is also depressed.
