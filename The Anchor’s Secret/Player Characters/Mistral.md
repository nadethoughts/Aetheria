### Mistral the Wind Between Shadows
(Vaerion Lumestris)  
Pronounced: “VAYR-ee-on Loo-MES-triss”  
“A wind that cuts, then cleanses.  
”  — Monk name “Mistral” pronounced “MISS-truhl”  
Origins of the Storm  

Vaerion Lumestris was born in the psionic forests of Luminael, heir to a lineage that tended  
living archives where memory itself whispered through crystal leaves. But he was a restless  
spirit—drawn not to study, but to motion. When the Flaming Retribution tore the skies and  
drowned whole cities, he fled toward the coast and found purpose in the underworld: smuggling  
relics, secrets, and people for coin. He told himself he was helping survivors. He was wrong.  

### The Turning  
One night a job went bad. The cargo was a historian carrying a lantern filled with ancestral  voices. In the struggle the lantern shattered, and the echoes called Vaerion’s true  name—accusing, mourning. The crew finished the job; the tide carried the body away. Vaerion  carried the guilt.  

He disappeared into the alleys of New Penmaris and found monks who fought in silence and  taught balance through survival. From them he learned to breathe between blows and to steal  only what could not be bought: peace. Still, redemption demanded isolation. He climbed the  cliffs north of the city and found a monastery carved into chalk stone where the sea sang  
through the halls. There he learned stillness until the storm inside him took form and  name—Mistral, the wind that cuts, then cleanses.  

### The Wind Returns  
Years later, the Tidewatch Ward fell to monsters and year. Walls rose where bridges should have  been. Mistral returned to the city he had fled, lighting a candle to Miraine for safe passage and  tracing Uhlvara’s compass in chalk on the dockside stones. He seeks no coin, only  balance—helping the lost cross from shadow into light. Every act of mercy repays a debt written  in salt.  

### Words on the Wind  
Name’s Mistral.  The wind doesn’t always blow gentle. Sometimes it cuts, clears the smoke, and leaves you  standing in the truth whether you like it or not. That’s me — the wind between shadows.  I wasn’t born with that name. Once, I was Vaerion Lumestris of Luminael — scribe, son, and fool  who thought running errands for smugglers was helping the desperate. I told myself it was  mercy, until mercy got a man killed. His blood stained the tide, and I heard my ancestors call my  name like a curse. So I ran — not from the city, but from myself.  

I found teachers in alleyways, monks who traded scripture for scars. They taught me how to  breathe between punches, how to find stillness in chaos. Later, a hidden monastery carved into  the cliffs showed me what balance really costs. When I left, I took a new name — Mistral —  because even a storm can learn direction.  Now I walk where others won’t. The Tidewatch Ward, the ruins, the places people whisper about  when lanterns burn low — that’s where I’m headed. If we’re crossing paths, it’s because the  gods, or the wind, decided it was time.  I don’t need riches. I’ve carried enough weight. What I do need are people who can stand their  ground when the tide turns red, and who know that some doors aren’t meant to stay closed.  So… if that sounds like you — keep up. And when I say run, trust me, I know where the light’s  coming from.
