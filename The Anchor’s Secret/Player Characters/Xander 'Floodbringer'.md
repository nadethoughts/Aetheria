## Back Story
Xander remembered fondly the day of his death. He awoke like any other morning, restless. Silencing his body's usual complaints, he rose and began the day, alone. He walked past the empty bedrooms, grabbed his fishing gear and headed out into the predawn quiet. He had learned to find fishing peaceful, and often used the time before the village awoke to reflect on better days. Days of comradery with his former platoon mates. Days of endless joy with his love. Days with his children. Too few, far too few. He recognized it when it began. His arm went numb, his breath caught in his throat, his chest tightened, and despite the pain, he smiled. His neighbors found his body a few hours later, peaceful, at rest. 

Days blurred into years. Years into centuries. Time lost all meaning, and Xander didn't care. He spent every moment with those who had went before him. His friends, his wife, his kids. Endless joy spent in the realm of Miraine, the Tidekeeper, whom he had served in life. Endless, until the world ended and fire rained from the sky. 

Miraine sent him back. That bitch!  He lives now in hell, filled with the memories of heaven. Trapped back in a mortal body, on Aetheria, torn again from those he loved. Returned to help and serve those who had survived, he supposed. He didn't care what her reasons were, he just knew that he hated her for doing it.

 He couldn't turn his back though on those in pain, those in need, he never could. So now he exists, every day a struggle, helping wherever he can. Although he is content to use the powers bestowed upon him from the Tidekeeper, he no longer serves her, he serves the people.

# What perilous experiment or ritual did you help contain before it could engulf a section of the city?
Was asked to create a shield to protect the rest of the city of [[New Penmaris]], and it went wrong. The idea was to use the sea to create a barrier to protect it from environmental issues. Creating a Tsunami on another part of the city.

# You worked side by side rescuing survivors from a capsized ferry near the harbor mouth. Whose quick thinking saved the most lives, and how did you celebrate after?
[[Ryan's Character]] was able to disassemble the mast and use it as a bridge to help the people across to dry shore. While [[Xander 'Floodbringer']] provided light for the people to walk to in the dark and provided healing for those who needed medical care.

[[Ryan's Character]] and [[Xander 'Floodbringer']] Celebrated their rescue of the ferry by going to the [[Sunken Shore Saloon]] and drinking the night away. Ryan's Character discovered that not only is Xander reserved, but he is also depressed.

### **Xander’s Drive to Enter Tidewatch Ward**

Xander isn’t motivated by duty to the city’s priests or council. He’s drawn by a simple, personal reason:  
**His fisherman friend hasn’t returned from his usual spot near the Tidewatch ruins.**  
No one asked Xander to look. No one expects him to care. But he does. The two share silent mornings on the docks, casting lines and watching the tide—never exchanging names, never needing to. When the fisherman’s boat is found abandoned near the ward’s edge, Xander knows something is wrong.

**Side Quest:**  
_Find the missing fisherman and bring him back safely—or at least discover what happened to him. Along the way, Xander may uncover clues about the ward’s dangers, and perhaps even a quiet moment of connection that means more than any council’s praise._

**How this fits the adventure:**

- It’s personal, not political or religious.
- It gives Xander a reason to explore the ward, search for survivors, and interact with NPCs who might know the fisherman’s fate.
- It can lead to clues about the pirates, the Saltspawn, or the Gloamways, but always through Xander’s lens: quiet action, not grand speeches.
