## Back Story
Xander remembered fondly the day of his death. He awoke like any other morning, restless. Silencing his body's usual complaints, he rose and began the day, alone. He walked past the empty bedrooms, grabbed his fishing gear and headed out into the predawn quiet. He had learned to find fishing peaceful, and often used the time before the village awoke to reflect on better days. Days of comradery with his former platoon mates. Days of endless joy with his love. Days with his children. Too few, far too few. He recognized it when it began. His arm went numb, his breath caught in his throat, his chest tightened, and despite the pain, he smiled. His neighbors found his body a few hours later, peaceful, at rest. 

Days blurred into years. Years into centuries. Time lost all meaning, and Xander didn't care. He spent every moment with those who had went before him. His friends, his wife, his kids. Endless joy spent in the realm of Miraine, the Tidekeeper, whom he had served in life. Endless, until the world ended and fire rained from the sky. 

Miraine sent him back. That bitch!  He lives now in hell, filled with the memories of heaven. Trapped back in a mortal body, on Aetheria, torn again from those he loved. Returned to help and serve those who had survived, he supposed. He didn't care what her reasons were, he just knew that he hated her for doing it.

 He couldn't turn his back though on those in pain, those in need, he never could. So now he exists, every day a struggle, helping wherever he can. Although he is content to use the powers bestowed upon him from the Tidekeeper, he no longer serves her, he serves the people.
