# What friend, mentor, or ally did you lose during a mission to secure the harbor — and what promise did you make in their memory?

- **Kobold** laborer who worked the **docks** in a rough district that was **flooded and overrun by monsters**.
- His **dockmaster** (and only friend) was killed during that attack. (What was his name?)
- In grief and fury, **Skirk picked up a boat anchor** and began smashing monsters — this event **unlocked his first rage**.
- **Promised to protect those around him** so that no one else would die as his friend did.

- Shares a **common patron/counselor** with Arthur, who recognized both for bravery.
# You were handpicked by the same councilor or guildmaster for your courage in defending others. What past deed earned their faith in you both — and what mission did they entrust you with now?
[[Arthur]] and [[Skirk]] were at the Dock's during the Tidewatch invasion and they attacked and defeated a Monster that was way more powerful than they should have been able to have, and the council member saw their Heroism. 

There was a Demon that was summoned in to [[New Penmaris]] that was able to escape to the Tide Watch Ward. [[Skirk]] and [[Arthur]] were hired to go into the Tide Watch Ward to find and defeat the demon.
