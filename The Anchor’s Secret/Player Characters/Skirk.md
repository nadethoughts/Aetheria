# Session 00 info
### **Skirk (Barbarian – Dave)**
- **Kobold** laborer who worked the **docks** in a rough district that was **flooded and overrun by monsters**.
- His **dockmaster** (and only friend) was killed during that attack.
- In grief and fury, **Skirk picked up a boat anchor** and began smashing monsters — this event **unlocked his first rage**.
- **Promised to protect those around him** so that no one else would die as his friend did.
- Shares a **common patron/counselor** with Arthur, who recognized both for bravery.
