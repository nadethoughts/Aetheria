# ⚔️ Classes of Aetheria

Adventurers come from every walk of life, but each carries a spark that sets them apart from ordinary folk. In Aetheria, these sparks manifest as _callings_—paths of power, skill, and destiny. Whether born of bloodline, training, faith, or sheer will, these classes shape how heroes rise to meet the dangers of the Fourth Age.

## **🪓 Barbarian**

Barbarians are warriors who draw strength from raw instinct, rage, and the primal forces of the world. In the wilds of Solaris—the storm-wracked north, the deep Verdant Strand, or the scarred mountains—barbarians learn to survive by becoming living storms of fury. Some channel animal spirits, others simply let loose the ferocity in their blood. In battle, they are unmatched in sheer resilience and savagery.

---

## 🎶 **Bard**

Bards are keepers of memory, storytellers, and wielders of magic woven through words, song, and performance. In Aetheria, bards are more than entertainers—they are historians of the Flaming Retribution, chroniclers of lost kingdoms, and inspirers of hope in New Penmaris. Their voice can soothe a crowd, rally soldiers, or twist fate itself. Bards walk freely among cultures, carrying tales from across the seas and mountains.

---

## ✨ **Cleric**

Clerics are conduits of divine power, chosen or devoted servants of the gods. The pantheon of Aetheria is vast, and each god grants their clerics miracles that reflect their domains—whether life, light, war, or more esoteric truths. Some clerics heal and protect, others call down radiant fire, and still others stride into battle armored in faith. In New Penmaris, clerics are vital voices of hope, tending both to the wounded and the fearful.

---

## 🌿 **Druid**

Druids are guardians of the natural order, voices of the wild, and wielders of elemental power. The Verdant Strand especially reveres druids, for they remember what was lost during the Flaming Retribution and strive to heal the land. Druids call on ancient forces of earth, sea, and sky—taking on the shapes of beasts, commanding storms, or binding wounds with primal magic. They are often seen as protectors of balance, mediators between civilization and the wild.

---

## ⚔️ **Fighter**

Fighters are masters of martial skill, honed through discipline, training, or necessity. From mercenaries to pirates on the Azure Sea, fighters are found wherever steel decides fate. They are versatile warriors—archers, duelists, guardians, or champions—able to adapt to nearly any battlefield. In New Penmaris, many who defended the Tide Watch Ward were fighters, standing as the city’s first and last line of defense.

### ⚙️ Mechanist

Inventors and tinkerers, mechanists turn scraps of metal, gears, and magic into wonders, crafting clockwork companions, ingenious gadgets, and unpredictable devices that push the edge of possibility. In Aetheria, they embody the spirit of rebuilding after the Flaming Retribution—some hailed as heroes who forge defenses, prosthetics, and machines to aid New Penmaris, while others sell their volatile creations to pirates and mercenaries. Whether visionary or reckless, every mechanist carries the spark of invention, bold and unrelenting in their quest to shape the future.

---
## 🧘 **Monk**

Monks discipline body and spirit into living weapons. Through rigorous training, mystical discipline, or divine enlightenment, they channel ki—life energy flowing through all living beings. In Aetheria, monastic orders can be found in hidden mountain temples, sunken ruins, or even quiet corners of bustling cities. Some monks master fluid strikes and lightning reflexes; others walk stranger paths, channeling their ki into elemental power or supernatural speed.

---

## 🛡️ **Paladin**

Paladins swear sacred oaths, binding themselves to ideals greater than life itself. Whether sworn to justice, vengeance, protection, or light, their faith shapes their powers. In Aetheria, paladins are often knights of forgotten orders, wandering champions of a god, or oathbound avengers carrying blades of holy fire. In New Penmaris, paladins are symbols of resilience, standing as unyielding shields in the city’s darkest days.

---

## 🏹 **Ranger**

Rangers are hunters, trackers, and explorers, blending martial skill with natural magic. Many call the wilds of Solaris home, whether patrolling mountain passes, keeping watch over forests, or guiding ships across dangerous waters. Their bond with beasts and knowledge of terrain make them invaluable scouts. In the monster-haunted Tide Watch Ward, rangers are among the first called to reclaim streets now ruled by predators.

---

## 🗡️ **Rogue**

Rogues thrive in the shadows, striking with precision where others rely on brute strength. Whether as thieves, spies, pirates, or assassins, they are experts in deception and survival. A rogue in New Penmaris might be a smuggler working the docks, a scout moving through monster-infested alleys, or a masked vigilante striking at corrupt guilds. In every case, rogues turn subtlety and skill into deadly weapons.

---

## 🔥 **Sorcerer**

Sorcerers wield magic born within their very blood. In Aetheria, sorcerous power often comes from the echoes of the gods’ war, the touch of dragons, or the lingering fallout of the Flaming Retribution. Unlike wizards, they do not study spells—they _are_ magic, shaping arcane forces with instinct alone. Their power can be as volatile as the sea around New Penmaris, but just as necessary in times of peril.

---

## 🕯️ **Warlock**

Warlocks bargain with powers beyond mortal understanding—ancient spirits, forgotten gods, or even beings from the outer planes. In return, they are gifted arcane secrets and eldritch might. Some warlocks whisper with entities that predate the Flaming Retribution; others seek the power of stars, shadows, or deep waters. Their patrons may be saviors or deceivers—but always dangerous. To walk the path of a warlock is to court destiny and doom alike.

---

## 📜 **Wizard**

Wizards are seekers of truth, bending arcane law to their will through relentless study. In the world of Aetheria, they are archivists of what little magic survived the destruction of the Flaming Retribution, hoarders of spells lost to fire and time. Wizards see themselves as architects of the Fourth Age, attempting to rebuild what was lost and surpass what came before. In New Penmaris, many hope wizardly research will uncover why the Tide Watch Ward fell.

---

### **Closing Note**

Each class represents not just skills and powers, but a philosophy of life in Aetheria. The Flaming Retribution scattered peoples and traditions alike, but the call to adventure endures. In New Penmaris—a city balancing between hope and ruin—heroes of every calling may rise to decide whether the tide of the Fourth Age turns toward survival, glory, or destruction.
