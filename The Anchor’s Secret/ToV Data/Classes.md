  
2 CLASSES 23 STARTING EQUIPMENT You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: • (a) a greataxe or (b) any martial melee weapon • (a) two handaxes or (b) any simple weapon • An explorer’s pack and four javelins RAGE 1st-Level Barbarian Feature In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can rage as a bonus action. While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor: • You have advantage on STR ability checks and saves. • When you make a melee weapon attack using STR, you gain a bonus to the damage roll, which increases as you gain levels as a barbarian (as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian Progression table). The damage type of this extra damage matches that of the weapon used to deal it. • You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. BARBARIAN Some warriors hail from untamed lands deemed inhospitable. These combatants, barbarians by name, are among the hardiest and most physically powerful warriors in the world. Though you may be born in the frozen wastes, the sweltering jungle, or the vast plains, your class options focus around your ability to slip into a state of frenzy, compounding your natural toughness and strength. Barbarian is a class that fights supremely well in bursts. Your class favors offense over defense, and has a lot of hit points to help absorb all the hits you’ll be taking. BARBARIANS AS ADVENTURERS Barbarians rely on immense strength and a familiarity with violence to work as capable adventurers. Most barbarians feel more at home in the wilds or a battlefield than they do in big cities or unfamiliar finery. Though barbarian adventurers commonly ally with skilled diplomats and cunning scholars, no ally is better suited to the bloodshed and chaos of combat than the barbarian. Whether facing maniacal hazards, scaling sheer cliffs, or holding off a swarm of ravenous undead, the barbarian is a powerhouse who survives horrific punishment with a smile. CLASS FEATURES As a barbarian, you have the following class features. HIT POINTS Hit Dice: 1d12 per barbarian level Hit Points at 1st Level: 12 + your CON modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d12 (or 7) + your CON modifier per barbarian level after 1st PROFICIENCIES Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons Tools: Herbalism tools Saves: STR, CON Skills: Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Nature, Perception, and Survival 24 PLAYER'S GUIDE If you can cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging. Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature or taken damage from a hostile creature since the start of your last turn. You can also end your rage early with a bonus action on your turn. You can rage a number of times equal to the number listed in the Barbarian Progression table. You regain all expended uses of Rage when you finish a long rest. UNARMORED DEFENSE 1st-Level Barbarian Feature While you aren't wearing any armor, your AC equals 13 + your CON modifier. (DEX doesn't factor into your AC for this class feature.) You can use a shield and still gain this benefit. DANGER SENSE 2nd-Level Barbarian Feature You gain an uncanny sense of impending danger, giving you an edge when avoiding harm. You have advantage on DEX saves while you aren't blinded, deafened, or incapacitated. RECKLESS ATTACK 2nd-Level Barbarian Feature You can throw aside concern for defense in favor of ferocious attack. When you make an attack on your turn, you can decide to do it recklessly. Doing so gives you BARBARIAN PROGRESSION LEVEL PB RAGES RAGE DAMAGE FEATURES 1st +2 2 +2 Rage, Unarmored Defense 2nd +2 2 +2 Danger Sense, Reckless Attack 3rd +2 3 +2 Barbarian Subclass 4th +2 3 +2 Improvement 5th +3 3 +2 Fast Movement, Multiattack (2/Attack Action) 6th +3 4 +2 Feral Instinct 7th +3 4 +2 Subclass Feature 8th +3 4 +2 Improvement 9th +4 4 +3 Brutal Critical (1 Die) 10th +4 4 +3 Heroic Boon 11th +4 4 +3 Subclass Feature 12th +4 5 +3 Improvement 13th +5 5 +3 Brutal Critical (2 Dice) 14th +5 5 +3 Persistent Rage 15th +5 5 +3 Subclass Feature 16th +5 5 +4 Improvement 17th +6 6 +4 Brutal Critical (3 Dice) 18th +6 6 +4 Unyielding Might 19th +6 6 +4 Improvement 20th +6 Unlimited +5 Epic Boon advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using STR during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until the start of your next turn. BARBARIAN SUBCLASS 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th-Level Barbarian Feature Choose a subclass that reflects the path you walk, either Berserker or Wild Fury (detailed at the end of this class). Your choice grants you features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level. IMPROVEMENT 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th-Level Barbarian Feature Choose one of the following improvements (ability scores can’t be raised above 20 with this feature): • Increase a single ability score by 2. • Increase two different ability scores by 1 each. • Increase one ability score by 1 and select a talent from the martial talents list (see Martial Talents in Chapter 4). FAST MOVEMENT 5th-Level Barbarian Feature Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor. In addition, when you roll initiative, you can immediately move up to half your speed. 2 CLASSES 25 BARBARIAN QUICK BUILD To quickly create a barbarian, follow these steps during character creation: • For ability scores, prioritize STR and then CON. • For lineage and heritage, choose any combination you like. • For background and talent, choose Homesteader and Aware. MULTIATTACK 5th-Level Barbarian Feature Your physical prowess has grown. On your turn, you can make two attacks when you take the Attack action. FERAL INSTINCT 6th-Level Barbarian Feature Your honed instincts give you advantage on initiative rolls. In addition, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, if you enter a rage before doing anything else on that turn. BRUTAL CRITICAL 9th, 13th, and 17th-Level Barbarian Feature You score a critical hit on a d20 roll of 19 or 20 with melee weapons and unarmed strikes. You also roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack. This extra damage increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level. HEROIC BOON 10th-Level Barbarian Feature Your commitment to the barbarian’s path grants you a powerful ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons: • Instant Rage. You can rage (no bonus action required) when you roll initiative and use your Fast Movement feature, if you have at least one use of Rage left to expend. • Stubborn Rage. Your rage ends only when its duration expires, you fall unconscious, or you choose to end it. RELENTLESS RAGE 14th-Level Barbarian Feature Your rage lets you shrug off even lethal wounds. While raging, if you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can make a DC 10 CON save. On a success, you don't fall unconscious until your current rage ends. You still make death saves and can be killed outright if you take damage from a single source equal to your hit point maximum. Even if you fail three death saves during your rage, you only die if you end your turn with 0 hit points. Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10. UNYIELDING MIGHT 18th-Level Barbarian Feature You have perfected the application of might and mettle. You gain the following benefits: • When you make an ability check or save using STR or CON, treat any d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10. • Your melee weapon attacks deal additional damage, equal to your STR score, to objects and structures. EPIC BOON 20th-Level Barbarian Feature Your commitment to the barbarian’s path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon: • Primal Champion. You embody untamed power. Your STR and CON scores each increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24. PLAYER ADVICE Even though barbarians are proficient with light and medium armor, wearing armor might not be the path to your best AC. Make sure your barbarian isn’t better off taking the AC bonus from the Unarmored Defense feature before you buy a whole suit of armor. BARBARIAN SUBCLASSES As you strengthen yourself against peril, you gain new capacity to channel your abilities in and out of combat. The subclass you choose reflects both the teachings of your forebears and the ways your might manifests. BERSERKER Through primal rite or natural bloodthirst, some barbarians can work themselves into a rage so ferocious and explosively violent that it risks breaking their bodies. Berserkers may lose themselves in their frenzy, seething with raw brutality, embracing the blood-soaked battlefield, uncaring of their own safety. BERSERKER PROGRESSION BARBARIAN LEVEL FEATURES 3rd Frenzy, Ruthless Bearing 7th Mindless Rage 11th Intimidating Presence 15th Retaliation 26 PLAYER'S GUIDE FRENZY 3rd-Level Berserker Feature You can choose to go into a frenzy as part of the same bonus action you use to activate your Rage feature. Once you do so, for its duration, you can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns. RUTHLESS BEARING 3rd-Level Berserker Feature Your ferocity looms at all times. You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill. If you are already proficient, double your PB instead for Intimidation checks. MINDLESS RAGE 7th-Level Berserker Feature While raging, you gain the following benefits: • You ignore any levels of exhaustion you currently suffer for the duration of your rage. • You can’t be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are already charmed or frightened when you enter a rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage. • During a Frenzy, if you score a critical hit or reduce a creature to 0 HP, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your PB + your CON modifier. These hit points last until expended or until you finish a short or long rest. INTIMIDATING PRESENCE 11th-Level Berserker Feature Your weapon attacks deal an amount of additional damage, equal to your PB (of the same damage type as the weapon), to frightened creatures. In addition, as a bonus action, you can attempt to frighten a number of creatures, up to your PB, within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you. Each target must make a WIS save (DC 8 + your PB + your CHA modifier + the number temporary hit points you currently have from your Mindless Rage feature). On a failure, a creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your bonus action to extend the duration of this effect on each frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn more than 60 feet away from you or can no longer see or hear you. If the creature succeeds on its save, you can’t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours. RETALIATION 15th-Level Berserker Feature When a creature hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed toward that creature and make a single melee attack against it. If the creature is Large or larger, you have advantage on the attack roll. WILD FURY Barbarians that travel the path of Wild Fury share an affinity and connection with the most ferocious and cunning animals of the natural world. Such barbarians often share close connections with druids or primordial spirits, but even a skeptical warrior might don the skin of a felled beast and feel its power fuel their rage. WILD FURY PROGRESSION BARBARIAN LEVEL FEATURES 3rd Animal Focus, Nature’s Cunning 7th Primal Aspect 11th Ferocious Howl 15th Empowered Rage 2 CLASSES 27 ANIMAL FOCUS 3rd-Level Wild Fury Feature You adopt the methods and abilities of a beast from your homeland to hone the power granted by your rage. To channel a beast’s might, you must have a marking, symbol, or token that represents it, such as tattoos reminiscent of a tiger’s stripes, a helm and cloak made of a bear’s hide, or a token made from hawk feathers. The Beasts listed here might not be appropriate for your character. In such instances, choose a listed option and represent it instead with a more fitting Beast. For example, a constrictor could stand in for an alligator or a mountain lion instead of a tiger. Alligator While raging, creatures you grapple are also restrained, and your speed isn’t halved while carrying or dragging a creature that you are grappling. As a bonus action, you can deal force damage equal to your STR modifier + your rage damage bonus to one creature grappled by you. Bear While raging, you can use a bonus action to gain temporary hit points, equal to your barbarian level + your CON modifier, that last for 1 hour. While you have any of these temporary hit points, you have advantage on attack rolls made with melee weapons. Tiger While raging, when you use your action to Dash, you can use a bonus action to make a melee weapon attack. If you move 20 feet or more in a straight line immediately before making this attack, you gain a +5 bonus to the attack and damage rolls. On a critical hit, roll your weapon’s damage dice three times instead of twice. Toad While raging, you gain resistance to all damage types except psychic. NATURE’S CUNNING 3rd-Level Wild Fury Feature The ways of the wild embolden you. You gain proficiency in the Animal Handling skill. If you are already proficient, double your PB instead for Animal Handling checks. PRIMAL ASPECT 7th-Level Wild Fury Feature The bestial power within you has grown, offering you one of the following benefits, granted by a beast you have an affinity for. You must possess an additional marking, symbol, or token related to the chosen animal to gain this effect. Hawk You have advantage on Perception checks and gain a +5 bonus to passive Perception. If you hit a creature with two or more melee attacks on a turn, you can attempt to grapple it as a bonus action. Lizard Your speed increases by 10 feet, and you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. In addition, when you take the Dash action, you can also gain the effects of a Disengage action in the same action. Turtle You gain a +1 bonus to AC while not wearing armor. While wearing armor, you gain a bonus to DEX saves equal to your rage damage bonus. Wolf Allies that can see or hear you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures within 5 feet of you. FEROCIOUS HOWL 11th-Level Wild Fury Feature You learn to spur your allies with the primal ferocity of your rage. When you enter a rage, you can use your reaction to bellow a primal battle cry. Each ally within 60 feet of you that can hear you gains advantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saves until the start of your next turn. EMPOWERED RAGE 15th-Level Wild Fury Feature Your connection with the beasts of the world is down in your marrow. Your rage is further improved by ties with another beast. You must possess an additional marking, symbol, or token related to the chosen animal to gain this effect. Crane While raging, your jump distance increases by 20 feet, and you take no damage from falling 100 feet or less. In addition, your reach with melee weapons (but not unarmed attacks) increases by 5 feet. Ram While raging, if you move 20 feet or more in a straight line toward a Huge or smaller creature and hit it with a melee weapon attack, the target takes 2d6 additional damage (of the same damage type as the weapon) and is knocked prone. Shark While raging, each time you hit a creature that is below its hit point maximum with a melee weapon attack, the attack deals an additional 1d12 damage (of the same damage type as the weapon). Snake While raging, you have advantage on opportunity attacks. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to your speed to remain within reach of the target. 28 PLAYER'S GUIDE BARD Bards are born performers who complement their diverse skillset with magical prowess. Their breadth of expertise makes them exceptional at whatever options they choose to cultivate. As a bard, your innate charisma makes you the class best suited to dealing with others, whether navigating tense social encounters or ensuring your allies survive a fight. Bard is a class that can do a little bit of everything in a game that often rewards specialization. The signature trick of a bard is your ability to quickly, directly boost your allies. Use this ability early and often. BARDS AS ADVENTURERS All bards are driven to seek stories, secrets, songs—and audiences—which are gained most readily on the road. Whether traveling with a performing troupe or as a solitary wanderer trading songs for supper, a bard’s mix of proficiencies and spellcasting make them more than capable of handling a challenge. CLASS FEATURES As a bard, you have the following class features. HIT POINTS Hit Dice: 1d8 per bard level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your CON modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your CON modifier per bard level after 1st PROFICIENCIES Armor: Light armor Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons with the Finesse property Tools: One type of musical instrument and two other tools your choice Saves: DEX, CHA Skills: Any three skills of your choice STARTING EQUIPMENT You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: • (a) a rapier or (b) any simple weapon • (a) a diplomat’s pack or (b) an entertainer’s pack • (a) a musical instrument or (b) a different tool you are proficient with • Leather armor and a dagger SPELLCASTING 1st-Level Bard Feature As a conduit for arcane power, you can cast Arcane spells. See Chapter 7: Spellcasting for general rules of spellcasting and the Arcane spell list. Cantrips At 1st level, choose three cantrips from the Arcane spell list to learn. You choose more Arcane cantrips to learn at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard Progression table. BARD QUICK BUILD To quickly create a bard, follow these steps during character creation: • For ability scores, prioritize CHA and then DEX. • For lineage and heritage, choose any combination you like. • For background and talent, choose Artist and Scrutinous. • For spells, choose the light, message, and vicious mockery cantrips. Then choose your 1st-circle spells: charm, hideous laughter, and thunderwave from the Arcane spell list and cure wounds from the Divine source spell list. For your ritual, choose unseen servant. 2 CLASSES 29 BARD PROGRESSION ARCANE SPELL SLOTS BY CIRCLE LEVEL PB FEATURES CANTRIPS KNOWN RITUALS KNOWN SPELLS KNOWN 1ST 2ND 3RD 4TH 5TH 6TH 7TH 8TH 9TH 1st +2 Bardic Inspiration (d6), Spellcasting 3 1 4 2 — — — — — — — — 2nd +2 Bardic Performance: Celebrate Life, Bardic Performance: Cutting Words, Expertise (2) 3 1 5 3 — — — — — — — — 3rd +2 Bard Subclass 3 2 6 4 2 — — — — — — — 4th +2 Improvement 4 2 7 4 3 — — — — — — — 5th +3 Bardic Inspiration (d8), Font of Inspiration 4 3 8 4 3 2 — — — — — — 6th +3 Bardic Performance: Clarity of Thought, Expertise (4) 4 3 9 4 3 3 — — — — — — 7th +3 Subclass Feature 4 4 10 4 3 3 1 — — — — — 8th +3 Improvement 4 4 11 4 3 3 2 — — — — — 9th +4 Bardic Inspiration (d10), Magical Secrets 4 5 13 4 3 3 3 1 — — — — 10th +4 Heroic Boon 5 5 14 4 3 3 3 2 — — — — 11th +4 Subclass Feature 5 6 15 4 3 3 3 2 1 — — — 12th +4 Improvement 5 6 15 4 3 3 3 2 1 — — — 13th +5 Magical Secrets 5 7 17 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 — — 14th +5 Bardic Inspiration (d12) 5 7 18 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 — — 15th +5 Subclass Feature 5 8 19 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 — 16th +5 Improvement 5 8 19 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 — 17th +6 Grand Performance 5 9 20 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 18th +6 Magical Secrets 5 9 22 4 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 19th +6 Improvement 5 9 22 4 3 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 20th +6 Epic Boon 5 9 22 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 1 1 Casting Spells You know several spells and can cast any of them by using an Arcane spell slot of the spell’s circle or higher. You don't need to prepare spells ahead of time. The Bard Progression table shows how many spells you know and how many Arcane spell slots you have at a given level. For example, at 3rd level, you have four 1st-circle slots and two 2nd-circle slots. If you know the 1st-circle spell magic missile and have a 1st-circle and a 2nd-circle spell slot available, you can cast magic missile using either slot. If you use a 1st-circle slot, you have three 1st-circle slots remaining. You regain all used spell slots when you finish a long rest. Spells Known of 1st Circle and Higher At 1st level, choose four 1st-circle spells that you know. Three of these spells must be from the Arcane spell list, but the fourth can be from any source spell list. Regardless of its source, it is an Arcane spell for you. The Spells Known column of the Bard Progression table shows when you learn additional Arcane spells. Each spell you choose must be from a circle for which you have Arcane spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level as a bard, you can learn one new Arcane spell of 1st or 2nd circle. The Magical Secrets feature also lets you learn spells from other sources at certain levels. In addition, when you gain a level of bard, you can choose one Arcane spell you know and replace it with another spell of your choice from the Arcane spell list. The replacement spell must be of a circle for which you have Arcane spell slots. Spellcasting Ability Charisma (CHA) is your spellcasting ability. Your CHA modifier determines the save DC or the attack modifier for certain spells you cast: Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus (PB) + your CHA modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus (PB) + your CHA modifier Rituals You can also cast a type of long-form spell called a ritual. 30 PLAYER'S GUIDE Rituals don’t count against your known spell total, and they don’t use up spell slots. At 1st level, choose one ritual from any spell list—Arcane, Divine, Primordial, or Wyrd (see Chapter 7: Spellcasting). Regardless of its source, it becomes an Arcane spell for you. You choose more rituals to learn at higher levels, as shown in the Rituals Known column of the Bard Progression table, but only from a circle for which you have spell slots. Rituals you learn don't count against the number of spells you learn at each level. Spellcasting Focus You can use a musical instrument (see Tools in Chapter 5) or an arcane focus (see Adventuring Gear in Chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your Arcane spells. At your GM’s discretion, you can use a suitable tool or object from a different tool kit you are proficient with as a spellcasting focus instead. BARDIC INSPIRATION 1st, 5th, 9th, and 14th-Level Bard Feature You can inspire others through stirring words, music, or other kinds of performance. As a bonus action on your turn, you can choose a creature within 60 feet of you, other than yourself, who can hear or see you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6. Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll that die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or save that it makes. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your CHA modifier. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, d10 at 10th, and d12 at 14th. EXPERTISE 2nd and 6th-Level Bard Feature Choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one skill proficiency and one tool proficiency. Double your PB for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (any combination of skills or tools) to gain this benefit. BARDIC PERFORMANCE 2nd and 6th-Level Bard Feature You weave magic into ongoing performances to produce effects beyond spells. You start with two effects: Celebrate Life and Cutting Words. You gain a new effect at 6th level, and some bard subclasses grant additional effects (see Bard Subclasses). Unless stated otherwise, targets must be within 30 feet of you and be able to hear or see you (depending on the type of performance) to be affected. As an action, you can use your Bardic Performance feature, choosing which performance effect you create when you do so. Once active, you can continue the performance for up to 1 minute, as long as you spend a bonus action at the start of each of your subsequent turns to maintain it. You can also choose to use your Bardic Inspiration feature as part of the same bonus action required to maintain this performance. Your performance ends early if you become incapacitated, silenced, use an action to begin a new performance, or choose to end the effect (no action required by you to do so). You can use your Bardic Performance feature to start a new performance a number of times equal to your PB, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Bardic Performance: Celebrate Life At 2nd level, while your Bardic Performance feature is active, allies within range can choose to expend one of their hit dice at the start of their turn. When they do so, they roll the expended die and recover a number of hit points equal to the result + your CHA modifier. In addition, allies within range have advantage on death saves, though they don’t need to see or hear you to receive this benefit. Bardic Performance: Cutting Words At 2nd level you gain a special reaction while your Bardic Performance feature is active. When a creature within range that you can see makes an ability check, attack roll, or damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration feature, rolling the die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature’s roll. Bardic Performance: Clarity of Thought Starting at 6th level, you gain this Bardic Performance option. While using your Bardic Performance feature, allies within 30 feet of you can’t be charmed and have advantage on saves against being frightened. If an ally within range is already charmed or frightened when you begin your performance, it has advantage on any saves it makes to end the effect as long as your performance continues. BARD SUBCLASS 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th-Level Bard Feature Choose a subclass that reflects the college you align with, either Lore or Victory (detailed at the end of this class). Your choice grants you features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level. 2 CLASSES 31 IMPROVEMENT 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th-Level Bard Feature Choose one of the following improvements (ability scores can’t be raised above 20 with this feature): • Increase a single ability score by 2. • Increase two different ability scores by 1 each. • Increase one ability score by 1 and select a talent from the technical talents list (see Technical Talents in Chapter 4). FONT OF INSPIRATION 5th-Level Bard Feature You now regain all expended uses of your Bardic Inspiration feature when you finish a short or long rest. In addition, you can now use your Bardic Inspiration dice in a new way. When a creature within 60 feet of you that you can hear or see you fails an ability check, attack roll, or save, you can use your reaction to expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration feature. When you do, roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to the target’s check total—potentially turning a failure into a success. MAGICAL SECRETS 9th, 13th, and 18th-Level Bard Feature You’ve picked up magical knowledge from just about everywhere. Choose two spells (or cantrips) from any spell list. A spell you choose must be of a circle you can cast with your spell slots, as shown on the Bard Progression table. The chosen spells count as Arcane spells for you and are already included in the number in the Spells Known column at these levels on the Bard Progression table. You learn two additional spells from any source at 13th level and again at 18th level. HEROIC BOON 10th-Level Bard Feature Your commitment to the bard’s path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons: • Persistent Inspiration. When a creature adds one of your Bardic Inspiration dice to an ability check, attack roll, or save, and the roll still fails, the die isn’t lost and can be used again. • Valiant Inspiration. When a creature with one of your Bardic Inspiration dice successfully deals damage with an attack, the creature can expend and roll the die to deal additional damage equal to the result. The extra damage is of the same type as that of the triggering attack (though the attacker chooses which type if there are more than one). Alternatively, when a creature with one of your Bardic Inspiration dice takes damage, the creature can use its reaction to expend and roll the die to reduce the amount of damage taken by an amount equal to the result + your CHA modifier. GRAND PERFORMANCE 17th-Level Bard Feature Your Bardic Performance feature now affects creatures within 60 feet of you that can hear or see you. EPIC BOON 20th-Level Bard Feature Your commitment to the bard’s path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon: • Curtain Call. If you start your turn with no uses of your Bardic Inspiration feature remaining, you can use your bonus action to recover a number of uses equal to your CHA modifier (minimum of 1). This bonus action can be taken as part of the bonus action required to maintain your Bardic Performance feature. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. BARD SUBCLASSES The bardic arts are ancient and heavy with traditions handed down from master to apprentice. While most bards still learn their craft from a single teacher, large settlements increasingly have colleges dedicated to training groups of students. These colleges typically focus on aspects of art deemed most useful to their patrons, which categorizes bards in ways that align with their abilities. LORE Bards who align with the college of Lore value knowledge most highly. Many from this college are preoccupied with preserving ancient rituals, folklore, and stories—or recovering such things that were lost. These bards glean wisdom from all manner of cultures and sources, allowing them to utilize their magic and talents in novel ways. LORE PROGRESSION BARD LEVEL FEATURES 3rd Bardic Performance: Ode to Heroes, Expanded Talent List, Jack of All Trades 7th Swift Ritual 11th Magical Rites 15th Peerless Skill BARDIC PERFORMANCE 3rd-Level Lore Feature You gain the following Bardic Performance option. Bardic Performance: Ode to Heroes You invoke songs and stories of legend to inspire your allies to new heights of heroism and to intimidate your foes. When you use your Bardic Performance feature, choose STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, or CHA. While your performance lasts, allies within range have advantage on ability checks that use that ability and enemies within range have disadvantage on ability checks that use that ability. 32 PLAYER'S GUIDE EXPANDED TALENT LIST 3rd-Level Lore Feature When you gain a new talent, you can select it from either the magic or the technical talents list (see Talents in Chapter 4). JACK OF ALL TRADES 3rd-Level Lore Feature You make it your business to collect lessons and practical guidance from the stories, songs, and cultures you encounter. You can add half your PB, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already include your PB. SWIFT RITUAL 7th-Level Lore Feature You can cast an Arcane ritual you know as an action, instead of using the ritual’s listed casting time. You must still provide all other components necessary for the casting. Once used, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest. MAGICAL RITES 11th-Level Lore Feature You learn two ritual spells of your choice from any source list. Each spell you choose must be of a circle for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Bard Progression table. The chosen rituals count as Arcane spells for you and aren't included in the number in the Rituals Known column of the Bard Progression table. PEERLESS SKILL 15th-Level Lore Feature When you make an ability check and have at least one use of your Bardic Inspiration feature available, you can use it to roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. If you succeed on the check, you get to keep the Bardic Inspiration die, but if you fail the check, the die is expended. VICTORY Bards who align with the college of Victory are tacticians who thrive in the heat of battle. Whether rallying battalions of troops or skirmishing with smaller parties, these bards lead allies to glory with their commanding presence and strategic genius. VICTORY PROGRESSION BARD LEVEL FEATURES 3rd Battle March, Bonus Proficiencies, Expanded Talent List 7th Multiattack (2/Attack Action) 11th Unified Front 15th Inspired Strike BATTLE MARCH 3rd-Level Victory Feature You gain the following Bardic Performance option. Bardic Performance: Battle March When you use your Bardic Performance feature and as part of each bonus action spent maintaining it, you can command up to three willing allies, who can hear or see you, to use their reaction to move up to half their speed. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. BONUS PROFICIENCIES 3rd-Level College of Victory Feature You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and one martial weapon of your choice. EXPANDED TALENT LIST 3rd-Level Victory Feature When your bard level grants you the Improvement feature and you choose to gain a new talent, you can select it from either the martial or the technical talents list (see Talents in Chapter 4). MULTIATTACK 7th-Level Victory Feature Your physical prowess has grown. On your turn, you can make two attacks when you take the Attack action. UNIFIED FRONT 11th-Level Victory Feature When you are affected by a spell or feature that targets an area and requires a save—like the fireball spell or a dragon’s breath weapon—you can use your reaction to expend a Bardic Inspiration die and add the result to your save against the effect. On a success, any friendly creatures in the affected area automatically succeed on their saves as well. INSPIRED STRIKE 15th-Level Victory Feature Once per turn, when you make a weapon or spell attack roll and have at least one use of your Bardic Inspiration feature available, you can roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the result to your attack roll. If you successfully hit with the attack, you get to keep the Bardic Inspiration die, but if you fail to hit, the die is expended. 2 CLASSES 33 CLERIC Clerics are as diverse as the gods they serve, but all are united in their mission to act as their faith demands. A cleric’s abilities reflect the strength of their faith. The more powerful a cleric becomes, the more their features resemble those of the god they worship. Cleric is a class that specializes in healing—a crucial part of the adventuring job. Your class features still give you plenty to do when no one is hurt, but no other class is set up to heal and restore damaged allies like yours. CLERICS AS ADVENTURERS Few people can channel divine power as easily as a cleric, so they are typically expected to face the world’s challenges from an early age—or are compelled to do so if their power comes to them later in life. Clerics possess awesome healing capabilities, a healthy mix of spells capable of harming foes or bolstering allies, and sturdy constitutions that allow them to survive a fight more easily than other casting classes. All these qualities make them welcome additions to an adventuring party. However, clerics are bound to serve their faith first and their companions second. When faced with ethically or morally complex situations, a cleric’s presence can be a boon—or hindrance—to making decisions as a group. CLASS FEATURES As a cleric, you have the following class features. HIT POINTS Hit Dice: 1d8 per cleric level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your CON modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your CON modifier per cleric level after 1st PROFICIENCIES Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields Weapons: Simple weapons Tools: None Saves: WIS, CHA Skills: Choose two from History, Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion STARTING EQUIPMENT You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: • (a) a mace or (b) a warhammer (if proficient) • (a) scale mail, (b) leather armor, or (c) chain mail (if proficient) • (a) light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon • (a) a priest’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack • A shield and a holy symbol SPELLCASTING 1st-Level Cleric Feature As a conduit for divine power, you can cast Divine spells. See Chapter 7: Spellcasting for general rules of spellcasting and the Divine spell list. Cantrips At 1st level, choose three cantrips from the Divine spell list to learn. You choose more Divine cantrips to learn at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric Progression table. Preparing Spells You must prepare spells in advance before you can cast them. You can prepare any spell on the Divine spell list from circles for which you have Divine spell slots. (You determine which spell slots you can access by checking your level on the Cleric Progression table). You can choose a 34 PLAYER'S GUIDE number of spells equal to your WIS modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). This is your list of prepared spells from which you can cast. Preparing a new list of spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell circle for each spell you change. You can change your list of prepared spells as part of a long rest. Casting Spells You have prepared a number of spells and can cast any of them by using a Divine spell slot of the spell’s circle or higher. The Cleric Progression table shows how many Divine spell slots you have at a given level. For example, at 3rd level, you have four 1st-circle and two 2nd-circle spell slots, and with a 16 WIS, you can have six prepared spells of 1st or 2nd circle, in any combination. You only have two spell slots for 2nd-circle spells though, so if you prepare only 2nd-circle spells, you won’t be able to use your 1st-circle spell slots at all. Casting a spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells, it just uses up a spell slot. You regain all used spell slots when you finish a long rest. Spellcasting Ability Wisdom (WIS) is your spellcasting ability. Your WIS modifier determines the save DC and the attack modifier for certain spells you cast: Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus (PB) + your WIS modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus (PB) + your WIS modifier Rituals You can also cast a type of long-form spell called a ritual. Rituals don’t need to be prepared, and they don’t use up spell slots. At 1st level, choose one ritual from the Divine ritual list (see Divine Ritual List in Chapter 7). You learn more rituals at higher levels, as shown in the Rituals Known column of the Cleric Progression table, but only from a circle for which you have spell slots. Rituals you learn don't count against the number of spells you learn at each level. Spellcasting Focus You can use a holy symbol (see Adventuring Gear in Chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your Divine spells. MANIFESTATION OF FAITH 1st-Level Cleric Feature Clerics demonstrate their faith in one of two primary ways, wielding it as a holy warrior or calling it as a miracle worker. Choose how you manifest your faith with one of the following. Manifest Might. You gain proficiency with heavy armor and one type of martial weapon of your choice (see Weapons in Chapter 5). In addition, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy: once per turn, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can deal additional radiant or necrotic damage (your choice) equal to your PB. Manifest Miracles. You learn one additional cantrip of your choice from any source of magic. This cantrip counts as a Divine cantrip for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of cantrips you know. In addition, you can add your PB to the damage you deal with any Divine cantrip. CHANNEL DIVINITY 2nd, 6th, 13th, and 18th-Level Cleric Feature You gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity to produce effects beyond spells. You start with one effect: Turn the Profane. Some subclasses grant additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in their descriptions (see Cleric Subclasses). When you use your Channel Divinity feature, choose which specific effect you want, such as Turn the Profane. Some of these effects require a save, and in those cases, the DC is equal to your cleric spell save DC. Beginning at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity feature once until you finish a short or long rest, then twice between rests at 6th level, three times at 13th level, and four times at 18th level. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain all expended uses. CLERIC QUICK BUILD To quickly create a cleric, follow these steps during character creation: • For ability scores, prioritize WIS and then either STR or CON (depending on if you take Manifest Might or Manifest Miracles). • For lineage and heritage, choose any combination you like. • For background and talent, choose Adherent and Mental Fortitude. • For spells, choose the guidance, sacred flame, and thaumaturgy cantrips (plus ray of frost if taking Manifest Miracles). Then prepare your 1st-circle Divine spells (choose a number of the following spells equal to your WIS modifier + 1): bless, cure wounds, guiding bolt, healing word, and shield of faith. Finally, choose your 1st-circle ritual: detect poison and disease. 2 CLASSES 35 CLERICS AND GODS One of the most important aspects of creating a cleric is choosing which god (or gods) you revere. Your relationship to these holy entities defines much of what you do and how others view you. Who you worship factors heavily into the subclass you choose at 3rd level, so think ahead and keep the themes of your faith in mind. Most campaign settings include pantheons of gods tailored to that particular setting. Your GM’s homebrew setting might have unique deities for your cleric to worship, as well. See Appendix B: Gods & Pantheons for a list of deities unique to the Labyrinth setting.

Each Fiend and Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you and that can see or hear you must make a WIS save. If the creature fails its save, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must try to move as far away from you as it can, though it can’t first get closer to you to do it. On its turn, it can use only the Dash action or otherwise try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, it can use the Dodge action. It can’t take any reactions. CLERIC SUBCLASS 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th-Level Cleric Feature Choose a subclass that reflects your relationship to your deity, Life, Light, or War (detailed at the end of this class). Your choice grants you spells and other features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level. Domain Spells Each cleric subclass has a list of domain spells that you can access as soon as you can cast spells of that circle (as shown on the Cleric Progression table). Once you gain such a spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare. However, casting a domain spell still expends a Divine spell slot as normal. If one of these spells isn’t on the Divine spell list, it still counts as a Divine spell for you. 36 PLAYER'S GUIDE IMPROVEMENT 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th-Level Cleric Feature Choose one of the following improvements (ability scores can’t be raised above 20 with this feature): • Increase a single ability score by 2. • Increase two different ability scores by 1 each. • Increase one ability score by 1 and select a talent from the magic talents list (see Magic Talents in Chapter 4). DESTROY THE PROFANE 5th, 8th, 11th, 14th, and 17th-Level Cleric Feature When a Fiend or Undead fails its save against your Turn the Profane feature, it is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating (CR) is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy the Profane table. DESTROY THE PROFANE CLERIC LEVEL DESTROYS FIENDS OR UNDEAD OF CR . . . 5th 1/2 or lower 8th 1 or lower 11th 2 or lower 14th 3 or lower 17th 4 or lower DIVINE INTERVENTION 9th-Level Cleric Feature You can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great. At the start of your turn, you can request aid from your deity by rolling a d20 and adding your PB. If the result is 19 or lower, your request fails, and your deity doesn't intervene. If the result is 20 or higher, your deity intervenes on your behalf, imbuing you with a fraction of their power. If your deity intervenes, you can immediately use your action to cast any spell with a casting time of 1 action from the Divine spell list or your domain spell list, regardless of preparation rules. Casting a spell in this way doesn't expend a spell slot and doesn’t require material components. If the spell is of a higher circle than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC for this check equals 10 + the spell’s circle. On a failed check, the spell fails, your deity’s power fades, and your action is lost. Alternatively, on a successful intervention, your GM can propose the form of the intervention. Anything that replicates the effects of a Divine spell is appropriate. In this instance, you still use your action but don’t cast a spell. You have final say on allowing the GM to pursue this option or choosing your own spell. If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 1 week. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest. HEROIC BOON 10th-Level Cleric Feature Your commitment to the cleric’s path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons: • Gift of Consecration. You are now immune to disease, poison damage, and the poisoned condition. If you die, your body is instantly preserved as per the gentle repose spell for up to a year and a day. • Gift of Wrath. Choose either the radiant or necrotic damage type. You are now resistant to damage of the chosen type. In addition, when you cast a spell that deals damage of any type, you can choose for it to deal radiant or necrotic damage instead (you choose which each casting). EPIC BOON 20th-Level Cleric Feature Your commitment to the cleric’s path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon: • Divine Herald. When you use your Divine Intervention feature, your deity automatically intervenes without a roll, and you no longer have to wait a week before you use Divine Intervention again, though you can still use it only once per long rest. You are still bound by the other restrictions of the feature. CLERIC SUBCLASSES You have proved your devotion, and your efforts are rewarded. You gain access to the powers of a domain that your god presides over or that best aligns with your faith. Three domains are presented here: Life, Light, and War. LIFE DOMAIN Gods of the Life domain celebrate natural cycles of life and death, exemplifying health and vitality. Devotees of this domain are encouraged to heal the wounded, care for the sick, and oppose the perversion of undeath. LIFE DOMAIN PROGRESSION CLERIC LEVEL FEATURES 3rd Channel Divinity: Preserve Life, Disciple of Life, Life Domain Spells 7th Blessed Healer 11th Greater Preservation 15th Perfect Healing CHANNEL DIVINITY 3rd-Level Life Feature You gain the following Channel Divinity option. Channel Divinity: Preserve Life As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to 5 × your cleric level. 2 CLASSES 37 Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. This healing has no effect on Undead or Constructs. DISCIPLE OF LIFE 3rd-Level Life Feature Your healing spells are more effective. When you use a Divine spell of 1st circle or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s circle. LIFE DOMAIN SPELLS 3rd-Level Life Feature You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Life Domain Spells table. See the Cleric Subclass class feature for how these spells work. LIFE DOMAIN SPELLS CLERIC LEVEL SPELLS 3rd bless, cure wounds, gentle repose, restoration 5th mass healing word, revivify 7th death ward, guardian of faith 9th greater restoration, mass cure wounds BLESSED HEALER 7th-Level Life Feature Healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a Divine spell of 1st circle or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s circle. GREATER PRESERVATION 11th-Level Life Feature The Preserve Life effect of your Channel Divinity feature can now affect any creatures within 60 feet of you. In addition, when you use Preserve Life, one target of your choice can also receive one of the following benefits: • Cure all diseases affecting the target. • End one of the following conditions affecting the target: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned. • Neutralize all poisons affecting the target. PERFECT HEALING 15th-Level Life Feature When you cast a Divine spell of 1st circle or higher that restores hit points, you automatically restore the maximum possible number of hit points. For example, if a cure wounds spell heals 1d8 + 3 hit points, rather than rolling, the target heals 11 hit points. WHAT IF THE DOMAIN I WANT ISN’T LISTED WITH MY GOD? Since a cleric picks their god at 1st level and commits to a domain at 3rd level, you might find that you want a domain that isn’t listed with your god on the Deities tables in Appendix B: Gods & Pantheons. Don’t worry! Suggested domains are just that—suggestions. Gods are powerful, mysterious beings with many facets. For example, it is completely reasonable to say that Ares, the Greek god of warfare, listed with the War domain, would also have use for a cleric devoted to the Death domain. Selecting a nontraditional domain for your cleric’s god could even lead to interesting stories. If you think your desired domain is completely at odds with your cleric’s god, work with your GM to discuss solutions that make sense for the game. 38 PLAYER'S GUIDE LIGHT DOMAIN Gods of the Light domain dedicate themselves to bringing light and warmth to the people of the world, burning away darkness and the evils that it hides. Devotees of this domain are often associated with the sun and moon, stars, truth, and the cleansing powers of fire. LIGHT DOMAIN PROGRESSION CLERIC LEVEL FEATURES 3rd Channel Divinity: Searing Radiance, Imbue Light, Light Domain Spells, Overwhelming Flash 7th Radiant Spellcasting 11th Lux Malediction 15th Luminous Shroud CHANNEL DIVINITY 3rd-Level Light Feature You gain the following Channel Divinity option. Channel Divinity: Searing Radiance As an action, you present your holy symbol and channel divine radiance through every magical light source that you’ve created so long as they’re on the same plane as you. Each hostile creature within the bright light of those sources must make a CON save. Roll a number of d8s equal to twice your PB. A creature takes radiant damage equal to the result on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save. Aberrations and Undead have disadvantage on the save. IMBUE LIGHT 3rd-Level Light Feature You learn the light and dancing lights cantrips if you don’t already know them. Dancing lights no longer requires concentration when you cast it and lasts for the duration or until you cast the spell again. These cantrips count as Divine spells when you cast them, but they don’t count against the number of cantrips you know as listed in the Cleric Progression table. LIGHT DOMAIN SPELLS 3rd-Level Light Feature You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Light Domain Spells table. See the Cleric Subclass class feature for how these spells work. LIGHT DOMAIN SPELLS CLERIC LEVEL SPELLS 3rd burning hands, guiding bolt, moonbeam, scorching ray 5th daylight, fireball 7th elemental shield, wall of fire 9th dispel evil and good, flame strike OVERWHELMING FLASH 3rd-Level Light Feature When a creature within 10 feet of you makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to release a brilliant flash of divine light. The creature suffers a penalty to the attack roll equal to your WIS modifier, potentially missing their target. If the attack still hits, the attacking creature is blinded until the end of its turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your PB. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. RADIANT SPELLCASTING 7th-Level Light Feature Your Divine cantrips that deal damage deal an additional 1d8 radiant damage. In addition, while you have light or continual flame cast on a weapon that you are holding, the first time that weapon deals damage on a turn, it deals additional radiant damage equal to your WIS modifier. 2 CLASSES 39 LUX MALEDICTION 11th-Level Light Feature The Searing Radiance effect of your Channel Divinity feature now causes all sources of light you’ve made to become magical sunlight for 1 minute. In addition, when you use your Overwhelming Flash feature against a creature, they are cursed by your luminance in one of the following ways: • The creature can’t regain hit points until the end of its next turn. • The creature takes radiant damage equal to your cleric level. • The creature suffers a −10 penalty to WIS (Perception) checks for 10 minutes. • The target can’t benefit from being invisible for 1 minute. A remove curse spell ends this effect. A creature can suffer only one curse at a time. If the creature starts and ends its turn in magical darkness, a Lux Malediction curse afflicting it ends. LUMINOUS SHROUD 15th-Level Light Feature While you are within an area of bright light, the radiance fills you with devout surety. You have advantage on saves, can't be charmed or frightened, and gain either immunity to radiant damage or resistance to necrotic damage (your choice). WAR DOMAIN Gods of the War domain celebrate strength, the glory of victory, and the thrill of competition. Those gods with evil or chaotic proclivities emphasize destruction and violence, but most societies and heroic characters worship war gods who honor courage and excellence in battle and cherish those who fight when the need is great. WAR DOMAIN PROGRESSION CLERIC LEVEL FEATURES 3rd Channel Divinity: Mark of Triumph, Disciple of War, Expanded Talent List, War Domain Spells, 7th Blessed Warrior 11th Greater Triumph 15th Holy Strike CHANNEL DIVINITY 3rd-Level War Feature You gain the following Channel Divinity option. Channel Divinity: Mark of Triumph As a bonus action, you present your holy symbol and mystically mark one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. Until the start of your next turn, all creatures who attack a marked creature have advantage on the first attack roll they make against it. DISCIPLE OF WAR 3rd-Level War Feature Victory brings you closer to the divine, inspiring you to press beyond your normal limits. Once per turn, when you successfully hit a creature with an attack while using the Attack action, you can choose to make an additional weapon attack as part of that same action. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your PB. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. EXPANDED TALENT LIST 3rd-Level War Feature When you gain a new talent, you can select that talent from the magic or martial talent list (see Talents in Chapter 4). WAR DOMAIN SPELLS 3rd-Level War Feature You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the War Domain Spells table. See the Cleric Subclass class feature for how these spells work. WAR DOMAIN SPELLS CLERIC LEVEL SPELLS 3rd command, magic weapon, shield of faith, warding bond 5th fear, spirit guardians 7th death ward, guardian of faith 9th antilife shell, flame strike BLESSED WARRIOR 7th-Level War Feature Attacks you make are particularly potent. When you deal damage with a weapon or spell attack made with a Divine spell, you can reroll any 1s you roll on the damage dice. You must take the new result for any dice rerolled in this way. GREATER TRIUMPH 11th-Level War Feature When you use the Mark of Triumph effect of your Channel Divinity feature, you can mystically mark a number of creatures equal to your PB. All targets must be within 60 feet of you. In addition, when a creature marked by your Mark of Triumph feature is reduced to 0 HP, you can use your reaction to move the mark to a different target within 60 feet of you that you can see. A mark moved in this way still disappears at the start of your next turn, as normal. HOLY STRIKE 15th-Level War Feature Once per turn, when you successfully hit a creature with a weapon or spell attack made with a Divine spell, you can treat the attack as if you rolled a critical hit. 40 PLAYER'S GUIDE DRUID Druids are the guardians and warriors of the natural world. All druids feel a deep affinity for the environment, whether it manifests as a spiritual connection to the beasts of the land, the plants of the earth, or the elemental energies that keep all things in balance. Druid is a class that interacts with the environment often. Your class is a “pure” spellcasting class, but your Wild Shape feature gives you some ability to mix it up. Lean into exploration with your various spells and capabilities. DRUIDS AS ADVENTURERS Druids are exceptional explorers and warriors. They hold an impressive range of magical abilities that allow them to heal allies, gather information, and invoke nature’s wrath. While druids regularly confront threats in the wild, their passions often clash with the values and ambitions of the civilized world. Few understand the awesome and often devastating forces of nature—and even fewer understand those who place nature’s interests above their own. CLASS FEATURES As a druid, you have the following class features. HIT POINTS Hit Dice: 1d8 per druid level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your CON modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your CON modifier per druid level after 1st PROFICIENCIES Armor: Light armor, medium armor, and shields Weapons: Simple weapons Tools: Herbalist tools Saves: INT, WIS Skills: Choose two from Animal Handling, Arcana, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Religion, and Survival STARTING EQUIPMENT You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: • (a) a shield or (b) any simple weapon • (a) a scimitar or (b) any simple melee weapon • Leather armor, an explorer’s pack, and a druidic focus SPELLCASTING 1st-Level Druid Feature As a conduit for primordial power, you can cast Primordial spells. See Chapter 7: Spellcasting for general rules of spellcasting and the Primordial spell list. Cantrips At 1st level, choose three cantrips from the Primordial spell list to learn. You choose more Primordial cantrips to learn at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid Progression table. Preparing Spells You must prepare spells in advance before you can cast them. You can prepare any spell on the Primordial spell list from circles for which you have Primordial spell slots. (You determine which spell slots you can access by checking your level on the Druid Progression table). You can choose a number of spells equal to your WIS modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). This is your list of prepared spells from which you can cast. Preparing a new list of spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell circle for each spell you change. You can change your list of prepared spells as part of a long rest. 2 CLASSES 41 Casting Spells You have prepared a number of spells and can cast any of them by using a Primordial spell slot of the spell’s circle or higher. The Druid Progression table shows how many Primordial spell slots you have per day at a given level. For example, at 3rd level, you have four 1st-circle and two 2nd-circle spell slots, and with a 16 WIS, you can have six prepared spells of 1st or 2nd circle, in any combination. You only have two spell slots for 2nd-circle spells though, so if you prepare only 2nd-circle spells, you won’t be able to use your 1st-circle spell slots at all. Casting a spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells, it just uses up a spell slot. You regain all used spell slots when you finish a long rest. Spellcasting Ability Wisdom (WIS) is your spellcasting ability. Your WIS modifier determines the save DC or the attack modifier for certain spells you cast: Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus (PB) + your WIS modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus (PB) + your WIS modifier DRUID QUICK BUILD To quickly create a druid, follow these steps during character creation: • For ability scores, prioritize WIS and then CON. • For lineage and heritage, choose any combination you like. • For background and talent, choose Homesteader and Aware. • For spells, choose the druidcraft, produce flame, and shillelagh cantrips. Then prepare your 1st-circle Primordial spells (choose a number of the following spells equal to your WIS modifier + 1): burning hands, entangle, fire under the tongue, goodberry, and speak with animals. Finally, choose your 1st-circle ritual: purify food and drink.

Rituals don’t need to be prepared, and they don’t use up spell slots. 42 PLAYER'S GUIDE At 1st level, choose one ritual from the Primordial ritual list (see Primordial Ritual List in Chapter 7). You learn more rituals at higher levels, as shown in the Rituals Known column of the Druid Progression table, but only from a circle for which you have spell slots. Rituals you learn don't count against the number of spells you learn at each level. Spellcasting Focus You can use a druidic focus (see Adventuring Gear in Chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your Primordial spells. DRUIDIC 1st-Level Druid Feature You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use a system of natural elements to leave hidden messages that only other druids will understand. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful WIS (Perception) check but can’t decipher it without magic. NATURE’S GIFT 1st-Level Druid Feature You have learned to harness the ambient energy of nature and can redirect that energy to encourage growth and healing. As a bonus action, choose one creature within 5 feet of you (this can be you). When you do so, roll a number of d4s equal to your PB (minimum of 2d4). That creature regains hit points equal to the total rolled. This feature has no effect on Constructs or Undead. You can use this feature a number of times per day equal to your PB. You recover expended uses when you complete a long rest. WILD SHAPE 2nd, 6th, 13th, and 18th-Level Druid Feature You gain the ability to channel energy directly from nature to produce effects beyond spells. You start with two effects: Beast Form and Draw Power. Some subclasses grant additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in their descriptions (see Druid Subclasses). When you use your Wild Shape feature, simply choose which specific effect you want, such as Beast Form. Some of these effects require a save, and in those cases, the DC is equal to your druid spell save DC. Beginning at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape feature once until you finish a short or long rest, then twice between rests at 6th level, three times at 13th level, and four times at 18th level. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain all expended uses. RULES OF TRANSFORMATION You can stay in a beast form for a number of hours equal to your PB. You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of Wild Shape. You can also choose to revert to your normal form as a bonus action. You automatically revert if you become unconscious, drop to 0 HP while in beast form, or die. While transformed, your game statistics are replaced by those of your new form, except you retain your INT, WIS, and CHA scores. You also retain your personality. If you make an ability check or save while in beast form, you can choose whether to use either your normal character proficiencies and PB or else use the Beast’s listed ability modifier to determine the check total (without your PB in this case). Your hit points for the new form are set to a new amount dependent on the size of your new form, as shown in the Hit Points by Form Size table. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 HP, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage while in beast form and your beast form has only 1 HP left, you revert to your normal form and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 HP, you remain conscious. You are limited by the actions you can perform by the nature of your new form, and you can’t speak or take any other action that requires hands or speech unless your new form is capable of such actions. You can’t cast spells while transformed. However, transforming doesn’t automatically break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast or prevent you from taking actions that are part of an ongoing spell—such as those required by the call lightning spell. Your gear and anything you are wielding melds into your new form. You can’t activate, use, or otherwise benefit from any of your gear while transformed. HIT POINTS BY FORM SIZE FORM SIZE HIT POINTS Tiny 2 + your PB Small 5 + your PB Medium 12 + your PB Large 22 + your PB Huge or Gargantuan 84 + your PB 2 CLASSES 43 Wild Shape: Beast Form As an action, you can magically assume the form of a Beast. When you first gain this feature, choose two Beasts of challenge rating (CR) 1/4 or less as your known forms. To select a known form, you must have seen or interacted with a Beast in your past. For example, a druid that hails from a desert environment is unlikely to be familiar enough with a sea-dwelling creature like a dolphin to select it as a known form. The Beast you choose can’t have any legendary actions or lair actions. See Appendix C: Creature Statistics for a selection of suitable Beasts to choose from. As you advance in druid levels, you can choose more beast forms as shown in the Beast Forms Known column of the Druid Progression table. When you gain a level of druid, you can replace one known form with a different form of your choosing. Any new form you choose must abide by the form restrictions. Wild Shape: Draw Power As a bonus action, you can reshape the natural energies around you to draw them within yourself and recharge your spellcasting ability. When you do so, choose a single expended Primordial spell slot to recover. The recovered spell slot must be of a circle equal to or less than your proficiency bonus (PB). For example, a 5th-level druid with a PB of +3 could recover an expended 1st, 2nd, or 3rd-circle Primordial spell slot with this feature. You can’t use Draw Power while transformed by the Beast Form effect of your Wild Shape feature, even if you have multiple uses of Wild Shape available to expend. DRUID SUBCLASS 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th-Level Druid Feature Choose a subclass that reflects your values and magical practices, either Leaf or Shifter (detailed at the end of this class). Your choice grants you spells and other features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level. Ring Spells Each subclass has a list of ring spells that you can access as soon as you can cast spells of that circle (as shown on the Druid Progression table). Once you gain such a spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare. However, casting a ring spell still expends a Primordial spell slot as normal. If one of these spells isn’t on the Primordial spell list, it still counts as a Primordial spell for you. IMPROVEMENT 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th-Level Druid Feature Choose one of the following improvements (ability scores can’t be raised above 20 with this feature): • Increase a single ability score by 2. • Increase two different ability scores by 1 each. • Increase one ability score by 1 and select a talent from the magic talents list (see Magic Talents in Chapter 4). IMPROVED BEAST FORM 5th, 9th, and 14th-Level Druid Feature You can now use the Beast Form effect of your Wild Shape feature to assume more powerful beast forms. When you learn a new form, you can choose a Beast of CR 1/2 or less. At 9th level, you can assume the form of any Beast of CR 1 or less. At 14th level, you can assume the form of any Beast of CR 2 or less. HEROIC BOON 10th-Level Druid Feature Your commitment to the druid’s path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons: • Rite of the Kingdom. All Beasts and creatures with the Animal tag understand your speech, and you can understand their noises and motions as if they were speaking, even if they don't speak a language. This ability doesn’t grant Beasts the intelligence to understand or communicate complex concepts, but you can share basic information with ease. Your GM has final say on what a particular creature can express. In addition, you have advantage on Charisma checks made to interact with or influence such creatures. • Rite of the Shaper. When you roll initiative and have no remaining uses of Wild Shape, you regain one use. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you complete a long rest. PLAYER ADVICE Nature’s Gift is not a spell, which means a druid can use it even while transformed by their Wild Shape class feature. DRUIDIC SIGNS AND SYMBOLS Druidic makes use of hidden signs to communicate messages. Examples of such signs are shown here. Stacked Stones Entwined Flowers Black Stones in Bird's Nest Mushroom Ring Acorn 44 PLAYER'S GUIDE NATURE’S GRACE 17th-Level Druid Feature Your attunement to the natural energies of the world infuses your body, sustaining you and protecting you from unnatural harm. You gain the following benefits: • You can’t be magically aged, and you suffer none of the frailty of old age. You can still die of old age though. • You no longer need food or water to survive. • Your ability scores and hit point maximum can’t be lowered by any means short of a wish spell. EPIC BOON 20th-Level Druid Feature Your commitment to the druid’s path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon: • Archdruid. You can use the Beast Form effect of your Wild Shape feature an unlimited number of times. In addition, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of Primordial spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost. DRUID SUBCLASSES While all druids revere nature, subclasses represent the specific ways druids best commune with the primordial forces of the world. The subclass you choose represents the rites, traditions, and mysteries you embrace in your quest to better understand the awesome powers of nature. LEAF Druids who align with the ring of the Leaf feel a deep connection to plants. Leaf druids are drawn to the quiet, natural spaces of the world. They find great peace and wisdom among hidden groves, ancient forests, and overgrown gardens left to flourish without the influence of civilization. To you, nothing is more important than nurturing the flora that makes all life possible. LEAF PROGRESSION DRUID LEVEL FEATURES 3rd Green Song, Leaf Ring Spells, Wild Shape: Sacred Grove 7th Take Root 11th Grove Warden 15th Heart of the Forest LEAF RING SPELLS 3rd-Level Leaf Feature You gain ring spells at the druid levels listed in the Leaf Ring Spells table. See the Druid Subclass class feature for how these spells work. LEAF RING SPELLS DRUID LEVEL SPELLS 3rd barkskin, entangle, goodberry, spike growth 5th plant growth, speak with plants 7th blight, freedom of movement 9th greater hold, tree stride GREEN SONG 3rd-Level Leaf Feature Your deep connection to plants allows you to communicate with them. As an action, you can focus on a nonmagical plant within 30 feet of you that you can see. When you do so, you immediately learn its basic properties, including whether it is edible, whether it is poisonous or otherwise dangerous, and what type of environment it typically grows in. You also learn its condition, including whether it is unwell due to magical or mundane means. In addition, Plant type creatures can understand your speech, and you can understand them as if they were speaking a language—regardless of what languages they know (if any). WILD SHAPE 3rd-Level Leaf Feature You gain the following Wild Shape option. Wild Shape: Sacred Grove As an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to infuse the area around you with primordial power, shaping it into a magical pocket grove. When you use this feature, vitality surges into the ground in a 10-foot radius centered on you. Normal plants in the affected area rapidly expand, and magical plants sprout from the ground. The sacred grove remains magical for 1 minute, until you use a feature that causes it to be destroyed, or you fall unconscious. After its magic fades, any nonmagical plants remain healthy and overgrown. You can choose to end this effect early (no action required). You can maintain only one sacred grove at a time. When you first create the grove, choose one of the following magical properties the grove has while its magic is active: • Tangle Weed. Creeping vines or brambles weave across the ground, making the area difficult terrain. When a creature attempts to move within the grove, you can use your reaction to command the vines to grab it. The target must succeed on a STR save against your spell save DC or be restrained by the grasping plants for the sacred grove’s duration. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action to make a STR check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained. 2 CLASSES 45 • Tree Line. Saplings surge from the ground, creating a protective circle. All creatures, except you, have disadvantage on attacks against creatures within the grove’s area. In addition, if you would take damage from a weapon or spell attack while on solid ground within the grove, you can use your reaction to command the grove to intercept it. When you do, you take no damage from the triggering attack and the grove is destroyed. • Wildflowers. Patches of aromatic magical flowers calm and clarify minds. All creatures in the grove have advantage on saves against being charmed or frightened. In addition, as a bonus action, you can choose to destroy the grove to end all conditions affecting one creature in the grove’s area. When you do so, all creatures of your choice on solid ground in the grove gain temporary hit points equal to your PB. TAKE ROOT 7th-Level Leaf Feature While standing on solid ground, you can use a bonus action to root yourself in place. While rooted, your speed is 0 feet, and you can’t be forced to move or be knocked prone by any means. You remain rooted until you choose to end the effect (no action required). If you are rooted when your turn begins, you can choose to spend one of your hit dice. When you do so, roll the die and regain hit points equal to the result plus your CON modifier. GROVE WARDEN 11th-Level Leaf Feature Your bond to your sacred grove has deepened, allowing you more precise control over it. The grove you summon using the Sacred Grove effect of your Wild Shape feature now covers a 30-foot-radius circle centered on you, and you can now decide whether allied creatures (including yourself) within the grove are immune to any effects it imposes. HEART OF THE FOREST 15th-Level Leaf Feature If you are reduced to 0 HP while within your sacred grove, the grove withers, and you regain a number of hit points equal to your druid level. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. If your body is destroyed completely, after the grove withers, a single acorn is left at its center. If this acorn is either undisturbed or planted somewhere, you gain a new body in 1d10 days and regain all your hit points. Your new body appears within 5 feet of the acorn, which is destroyed as soon as you regain consciousness. SHIFTER Druids that align with the ring of the Shifter feel a deep connection to the animals that walk the world. Shifters delve into the mysteries of transformation, spending much of their time in the forms of the beasts they so admire. To you, there is no greater joy than feeling wind beneath your wings, stalking prey on padded paws, or swimming through crystalline depths. SHIFTER PROGRESSION DRUID LEVEL FEATURES 3rd Potent Forms, Quick Shift, Shifter Ring Spells 7th Beast’s Fury 11th Elemental Infusion 15th Manifold Mind POTENT FORMS 3rd-Level Shifter Feature You can select more powerful creatures for the known forms used with the Beast Form effect of your Wild Shape feature. When you gain this feature, you can choose any Beast or creature with the Animal tag with a CR of 1 or lower as a known form. PLAYER ADVICE Your GM has the full list of creatures with the Animal tag that are compatible with this feature, but common options include owlbear, griffon, hippogriff, pegasus, and worg. Some suitable options are included in Appendix C: Creature Statistics. In addition, you can now speak any language you know while in beast form—even if your chosen form would not typically allow you to do so. However, you still can’t cast spells while transformed, even if a spell requires only a verbal component. At higher druid levels, you can choose beast forms with a CR as high as your druid level divided by 3, rounded down (ignoring CR limitations in your Improved Beast Form feature). For example, upon achieving 6th level of druid, you can choose any Beast of CR 2 or lower as a known form, CR 3 or lower at 9th level, and so on—as shown in the Potent Forms table. POTENT FORMS DRUID LEVEL MAX CR EXAMPLE DRUID LEVEL MAX CR EXAMPLE 3rd 1 Wolf 12th 4 Elephant 5th 1 Hippogriff 15th 5 Triceratops 6th 2 Pegasus 18th 6 Mammoth 9th 3 Owlbear 46 PLAYER'S GUIDE QUICK SHIFT 3rd-Level Shifter Feature By delving into the mysteries of the shifters, you have learned to change form more rapidly. When you use the Beast Form effect of your Wild Shape feature, you can transform as a bonus action instead of as an action. SHIFTER RING SPELLS 3rd-Level Shifter Feature You gain ring spells at the druid levels listed in the Shifter Ring Spells table. See the Druid Subclass class feature for how these spells work. SHIFTER RING SPELLS DRUID LEVEL SPELLS 3rd alter self, animal friendship, speak with animals, wildsense 5th conjure animals, water breathing 7th giant insect, polymorph 9th dominate, insect plague BEAST’S FURY 7th-Level Shifter Feature Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn while in beast form, you can use your bonus action to make a single unarmed strike with your claws, hooves, fangs, or whatever natural weapon suits your chosen form. This attack deals 1d6 + your PB damage, and you are considered proficient with it. You decide if this attack deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage when you first assume your beast form. In addition, all damage you deal with melee weapon attacks while in beast form now counts as magical damage for the purposes of overcoming resistance or immunity to nonmagical damage. ELEMENTAL INFUSION 11th-Level Shifter Feature By expending two uses of the Beast Form effect of your Wild Shape feature, you can infuse your chosen form with one of the four elemental powers described here. Alternatively, you can use your reaction to spend one use of Wild Shape while already transformed by the Beast Form effect, either infusing yourself with one of the following powers or changing which power is active. Air You gain a 90-foot flying (hover) speed and are resistant to lightning and thunder damage. You gain the following action: • Whirl (Recharge 4–6). Each Large or smaller creature within 5 feet of you must make a STR save (DC 10 + your PB). On a failure, a target takes 3d8 + your PB bludgeoning damage and is flung up to 20 feet away from you in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, it takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target lands in the same space as another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 DEX save or take the same damage and be knocked prone. The target is then prone in an adjacent unoccupied space. If the target’s STR save is successful, a target takes half damage and isn’t flung or knocked prone. Earth You gain a 30-foot burrowing speed and can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone without disturbing the material you move through. You gain tremorsense to a range of 60 feet and are resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. Melee attacks you make deal double damage to objects and structures. Fire You shed bright light in a 30-foot-radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. You are immune to fire damage. Melee attacks you make deal an additional 1d8 fire damage. When you deal fire damage to a flammable creature or object, you can choose whether it ignites—an ignited target takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns until a creature uses an action to douse it. Your GM determines what constitutes a flammable creature or object. Water You gain a 90-foot swimming speed and can breathe underwater. You are resistant to cold and poison damage. You gain the following action: • Wave (Recharge 4–6). Each creature within 5 feet of you must make a STR save (DC 10 + your PB). On a failure, a target takes 2d8 + your PB bludgeoning damage. If a target is Large or smaller, it is also grappled (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and unable to breathe unless it can breathe in water. On a successful STR save, a creature takes half damage and isn’t grappled. At the start of each of your turns, each target grappled by you takes 2d8 + your PB bludgeoning damage. A creature within 5 feet of a grappled target can pull it out of the grapple if it expends an action to attempt a DC 14 STR (Athletics) check—freeing the target on a success. MANIFOLD MIND 15th-Level Shifter Feature You can now cast Primordial spells while in beast form, and your form doesn't hinder performing the somatic and verbal components of spells. You must still provide any required material components as normal. 2 CLASSES 47 FIGHTER There are many ways to build a fighter, but at the end of the day, their talents shine brightest in the thick of a fight. Whether archer, knight, wrestler, or general, your class options are designed to make you the best at dishing out damage with your favorite weapons. What fighters are good at is written on the label. Your class gives you more options than just standing and swinging to hit, however. Use weapon options to change up a fight and make things easier for the less martially inclined party memebers. FIGHTERS AS ADVENTURERS Fighters are capable and hardy, and they excel at combat— all qualities well-suited to life as an adventurer. With the diverse weapon and armor options available, they can easily thrive on the frontlines of combat or decimate foes from afar with ranged attacks. While everyone benefits from having a fighter at their side in combat, fighters often serve as a grounding force in adventuring parties. A fighter’s skills are recognizable across numerous cultures and communities. This can make them more relatable to common folk who understand skill with a weapon more than rarefied magic use. CLASS FEATURES As a fighter, you have the following class features. HIT POINTS Hit Dice: 1d10 per fighter level Hit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your CON modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d10 (or 6) + your CON modifier per fighter level after 1st PROFICIENCIES Armor: All armor and shields Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons Tools: None Saves: STR, CON Skills: Choose two from Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, History, Insight, Intimidation, Perception, and Survival STARTING EQUIPMENT You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: • (a) chain mail or (b) leather armor, longbow, and 20 arrows • (a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons • (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) two handaxes • (a) a dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack LAST STAND 1st-Level Fighter Feature When you take damage that would reduce your hit points to less than half your hit point maximum (rounded down), you can use your reaction to spend hit dice, up to a number equal to your PB. Immediately roll those hit dice. You regain hit points equal to the sum of all dice rolled + your CON modifier. MARTIAL ACTION 1st-Level Fighter Feature Your tactical expertise allows you to act quickly on the battlefield. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat to perform a weapon option (see Weapon Options in Chapter 5) or one of the martial actions granted by this feature. Choose one of the following martial actions that you know. 48 PLAYER'S GUIDE Aim Requires Wielding a Ranged or Thrown Weapon As a bonus action, you take the time to increase the effectiveness of your next ranged weapon attack. Select one target you can see. If you make a ranged weapon attack against that target before the end of your turn, double your PB for the first attack roll. Guard Requires Wielding a Shield As a bonus action, you raise your shield to intercept incoming attacks. Select one enemy creature within 5 feet of you. That creature has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes against you or an ally within 5 feet of you before the start of your next turn. Quick Strike Requires Wielding Two Light Weapons After you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a Light melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to make two attacks with a different Light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand—instead of the one attack typically granted by two-weapon fighting. Don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of these additional attacks unless the modifier is negative. Wind Up Requires Wielding a Heavy or a Versatile Melee Weapon with Both Hands As a bonus action, you ready a powerful attack against a nearby target. Select one target you can see within 10 feet of you. If you hit that target with a melee weapon attack before the end of your turn, the first such attack deals extra damage equal to your PB (of the same damage type as the weapon). ACTION SURGE 2nd, 13th, and 18th-Level Fighter Feature When the need is great, you push your body to its absolute limit. On your turn, you can activate this feature to gain another action—in addition to the action and possible bonus action you regularly get on your turn. Once you use this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 13th level, you can use it twice before a rest but only once on the same turn. At 18th level, you can use it three times before a rest but only once on the same turn FIGHTER SUBCLASS 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th-Level Fighter Feature Choose a subclass that reflects your role in battle, either Spell Blade or Weapon Master (detailed at the end of this class). Your choice grants you features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level. IMPROVEMENT 4th, 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th-Level Fighter Feature Choose one of the following improvements (ability scores can’t be raised above 20 with this feature): • Increase a single ability score by 2. • Increase two different ability scores by 1 each. • Increase one ability score by 1 and select a talent from the martial talents list (see Martial Talents in Chapter 4). MULTIATTACK 5th, 9th, and 17th-Level Fighter Feature Your physical prowess has grown. On your turn, you can make two attacks when you take the Attack action. Starting at 9th level, you can make three attacks when you take the Attack action. At 17th level, you can make four. FIGHTER QUICK BUILD To quickly create a fighter, follow these steps during character creation: • For ability scores, prioritize STR and then either INT (if you plan to take Spell Blade subclass) or DEX. • For lineage and heritage, choose any combination you like. • For background and talent, choose Soldier and either Combat Casting (if you plan to take Spell Blade subclass) or Combat Conditioning. FIGHTER PROGRESSION LEVEL PB FEATURES 1st +2 Last Stand, Martial Action 2nd +2 Action Surge 3rd +2 Fighter Subclass 4th +2 Improvement 5th +3 Multiattack (2/Attack Action) 6th +3 Improvement 7th +3 Subclass Feature 8th +3 Improvement 9th +4 Multiattack (3/Attack Action) 10th +4 Heroic Boon 11th +4 Subclass Feature 12th +4 Improvement 13th +5 Action Surge (2/Rest) 14th +5 Improvement 15th +5 Subclass Feature 16th +5 Improvement 17th +6 Multiattack (4/Attack Action) 18th +6 Action Surge (3/Rest) 19th +6 Improvement 20th +6 Epic Boon 2 CLASSES 49 HEROIC BOON 10th-Level Fighter Feature Your commitment to the fighter’s path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons: • Defiant. When you fail a save, you can instead choose to succeed on the save. You can use this feature once and regain the use of it when you finish a long rest. You can use it twice before a long rest at 13th level, and three times at 17th. • Unstoppable. When you start your turn, you can choose to end one of the following conditions affecting you: blinded, charmed, frightened, incapacitated, paralyzed, or stunned. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your PB, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. EPIC BOON 20th-Level Fighter Feature Your commitment to the fighter’s path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon: • Turn the Tide. Once on each of your turns, when you hit a creature or object with a weapon attack on your turn, you can cause the attack to deal additional damage (of the same damage type as the weapon) equal to your STR or DEX score (your choice). The attack’s damage ignores resistance and immunity, and it can’t be reduced or avoided by any means. FIGHTER SUBCLASSES As you develop mastery, you gain new abilities that support your preferred combat tactics. The subclass you choose represents your specialized training in pursuit of evergreater martial might. SPELL BLADE Fighters of the Spell Blade discipline view fighting with swords and sorcery as a logical marriage of power. For you, magic can be wielded as a weapon, and honing your mind is just as important as honing your body. ARCANE SPELLCASTING 3rd-Level Spell Blade Feature You enhance your martial prowess with the ability to cast Arcane spells. See Spell Rules in Chapter 7: Spellcasting for the general rules of spellcasting and the Arcane spell list. Cantrips At 3rd level, choose two cantrips to learn from the Arcane spell list. You choose more Arcane cantrips to learn at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Spell Blade Progression table. Casting Spells You know a small number of spells and can cast any of them by using an Arcane spell slot of the spell’s circle or higher. You don't need to prepare spells ahead of time.

For example, at 7th level, you have four 1stcircle slots and two 2nd-circle slots. If you know the 1stcircle spell shield and have a 1st-circle and a 2nd-circle spell slot available, you can cast shield using either slot. If you use a 1st-circle slot, you have three 1st-circle slots remaining. You regain all used spell slots when you finish a long rest. Spells Known of 1st Circle and Higher At 3rd level, choose three 1st-circle spells from the Arcane spell list that you know, two of which must be from either the abjuration or evocation schools. The Spells Known column of the Spell Blade Progression table shows when you learn additional Arcane spells. Each spell you choose must be an abjuration or evocation spell and from a circle for which you have Arcane spell slots. In addition, when you gain a level of fighter, you can choose one Arcane spell you know and replace it with another spell of your choice from the Arcane spell list. The replacement spell must be of a circle for which you have Arcane spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell—unless you’re replacing the third spell you gained at 3rd level. Spellcasting Ability Intelligence (INT) is your spellcasting ability. Your INT modifier determines the save DC or the attack modifier for certain spells you cast: Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus (PB) + your INT modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus (PB) + your INT modifier ENCHANT WEAPON 3rd, 11th, and 15th-Level Spell Blade Feature A crucial step on the path of the spell blade is learning to imbue your weapons with magical power. If you spend 1 hour of uninterrupted focus in contact with a weapon (which can be done during a rest) you can imbue that weapon with a limited form of enchantment. This enchantment lasts until you either choose to end it or use this feature to enchant a different weapon. Your enchanted weapon functions as a magic weapon with the following properties: • If it is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use a bonus action to summon the weapon. When you do so, the weapon instantly appears in your hand. • You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. If the weapon would normally grant a magical bonus to attack and damage rolls, your enchantment bonus stacks with the weapon’s existing bonus. Creatures who handle or inspect the enchanted weapon can tell it isn’t a true magic item (unless the weapon was magic to begin with). Otherwise, it follows the rules of a typical magic item (see Magic Items in Chapter 5). Starting at 11th level, the bonus increases to +2. At 15th level, it becomes +3. EXPANDED TALENT LIST 3rd-Level Spell Blade Feature When you gain a new talent, you can select it from either the magic or the martial talents list (see Talents in Chapter 4). SPELL MULTIATTACK 7th-Level Spell Blade Feature When you use your Multiattack class feature to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, you can replace one of those attacks with the casting of a cantrip that you know with a casting time of 1 action. You can’t cast more than one cantrip in one Attack action in this way. 2 CLASSES 51 FOLLOW THROUGH 11th-Level Spell Blade Feature When you take the Cast a Spell action, you can make a single weapon attack as part of that same action, provided a target is within range. CHARGED STRIKE 15th-Level Spell Blade Feature You can add your INT modifier (minimum of +1) to the damage of your melee weapon attacks in addition to either your STR or DEX modifier. In addition, any damage you deal with a weapon is considered magical. WEAPON MASTER Most fighters feel a deep connection to their weapons, but none more so than the Weapon Master. For them, a favored bow or blade is a natural extension of their body and a trusted ally. Fighters who pursue this subclass learn to use their chosen arms with efficiency and artistry. WEAPON MASTER PROGRESSION FIGHTER LEVEL FEATURES 3rd Mastery, Stunts 7th Deadly Flourish 11th Advanced Stunts 15th Grand Finale MASTERY 3rd-Level Weapon Master Feature Choose three types of simple or martial weapons with which you have proficiency. You have mastered the use of those three weapons. Once per turn, when you roll damage for an attack with a weapon you have mastered, you can reroll the weapon’s damage dice and use either result. Alternatively, once per turn, when you use a weapon option (see Weapon Options in Chapter 5) for a weapon that you have mastered, you can roll the attack’s damage even if the weapon option doesn’t normally allow it. STUNTS 3rd-Level Weapon Master Feature As part of your training, you’ve learned to use unique tactics with certain weapons. You gain access to special maneuvers called stunts. To use a stunt, you must wield a weapon that matches the weapon type listed in the stunt description (if one is listed). You can only use one stunt per turn. You gain access to advanced stunts at higher levels. All stunts listed are available to you at 3rd level. You can perform stunts a number of times equal to your PB + 1. After that, you must finish a short or long rest to regain expended uses. Saves. Some stunts require your target to make a save to resist its effects. The save DC for these stunts is calculated as follows: Stunt save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus (PB) + your STR or DEX modifier (your choice) Stunts are presented in alphabetical order. Arcing Strike Requires a Heavy Melee Weapon When you deal damage with a heavy weapon wielded in both hands, you can also deal half the damage you dealt to a different target within reach that you can see. If the second target is an object, it takes the full damage instead. You can decide to use this after you know your damage roll. Cheap Shot Requires a Melee Weapon When you successfully hit a target with a melee weapon as part of the Attack action, you can immediately make an unarmed strike against that target as part of the same Attack action. Make It Count When you take the Attack action, you can make a single weapon attack with a +10 to the attack roll. On a hit, the attack deals additional damage equal to your fighter level. You can’t make additional attacks as part of that Attack action, even if a feature like Multiattack would normally allow you to do so. Parry Requires a Melee Weapon When a creature you can see hits you with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage you take by 1d10 + your PB (to a minimum of 0 damage). Redirect When you miss a target with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to immediately reroll the attack, but you must select a different target you can see within 5 feet of the original target. Riposte Requires a Melee Weapon When a creature you can see within range misses you with a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to immediately make a melee weapon attack against that creature. Straight Through Requires a Ranged Weapon When you deal damage with a ranged weapon attack, you can also deal half the damage you dealt to a different target you can see within 5 feet of the original target. You can decide to use this after you know your damage roll. 52 PLAYER'S GUIDE Tactical Retreat Requires a Melee Weapon When you hit a creature with a weapon as part of the Attack action, you can immediately move up to half your speed as part of the same action without provoking opportunity attacks. DEADLY FLOURISH 7th-Level Weapon Master Feature Attacks made with weapons you have mastered through your Mastery feature score critical hits on rolls of 19 or 20. When you score a critical hit, you can use your reaction to do one of the following: • Make a ranged weapon attack against a number of creatures equal to your PB within 15 feet of the target hit by your critical hit. • Make a separate melee attack against each creature within 5 feet of you. ADVANCED STUNTS 11th-Level Weapon Master Feature The following powerful stunts are available to you whenever you could use a stunt. Assassin’s Ambush When you hit a creature, from which you are hidden, with a weapon attack, roll your weapon damage dice twice instead of once. On a critical hit, roll the weapon’s damage dice three times instead of twice. Bulwark Requires a Shield When you take damage from a spell or ability that requires a save, such as the fireball spell, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage dealt to you by an amount equal to your AC. Psychic damage can't be reduced by this stunt. Felling Sweep Requires a Heavy Melee Weapon As an action, you can make a single melee attack that targets each creature within reach, using a single attack and damage roll. Preemptive Strike Requires a Melee Weapon When a creature comes within reach of your weapon, you can use your reaction to make a single attack against it. On a hit, the target’s speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn. Rapid Release Requires a Ranged or Thrown Weapon After you take the Attack action, you can use a bonus action to make an additional attack with a ranged or thrown weapon. You can draw a thrown weapon as part of the attack. Wrestler’s Clutch Requires a Melee Weapon When you hit a creature with a melee attack, the creature must succeed on a STR save or become grappled by you. While this grapple persists, stunts you use against the grappled creature don't expend uses of your Stunts feature. This grapple ends if you attack another creature, the target escapes, or you end it (no action required). GRAND FINALE 15th-Level Weapon Master Feature When you roll initiative and have no uses of your Stunts feature remaining, you can regain 3 uses. You must complete a long rest before you can use this feature again. 2 CLASSES 53 MECHANIST Mechanists are inventors, makers, and engineers, interested in the composition of material objects and in the components of creation itself. While others dedicate their lives to mastering magic or science, the mechanist sees such forces as flexible components within a grander design. To walk the path of the mechanist is to open the back of the universe, observe its moving parts, and restructure them as suits your needs. Mechanist is a class that invites creative interpretation by players. Your class can hold up in combat, but finding ways to use the items and objects around you brings out the aspects that make this class shine. MECHANISTS AS ADVENTURERS Mechanists are capable warriors with an arsenal of magical tricks. With a little creativity, a mechanist can create items or tools to suit any purpose, whether creating weapons that exploit a foe’s weakness, conjuring a device to save a falling friend, or enhancing a vehicle to reach a destination in record time. CLASS FEATURES As a mechanist, you have the following class features. HIT POINTS Hit Dice: 1d10 per mechanist level Hit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your CON modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d10 (or 6) + your CON modifier per mechanist level after 1st PROFICIENCIES Armor: Light armor, medium armor, and shields Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons Tools: Tinker tools and two additional tools your choice Saves: CON, INT Skills: Choose two from Arcana, History, Investigation, Perception, and Sleight of Hand STARTING EQUIPMENT You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: • (a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two simple weapons • Light crossbow and 20 bolts • (a) scale mail or (b) leather armor • Tinker tools and a dungeoneer’s pack EYES OF THE MAKER 1st-Level Mechanist Feature When you touch a magic item or some other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties and how to use it, whether it requires attunement to use, and how many charges it has (if any). You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it. SHARD OF CREATION 1st-Level Mechanist Feature You learn how to craft a shard of creation, which is a Tiny magical object with many uses that appears on your person. In its base state, the shard appears as a constantly shifting, fluid-like bundle of plasma. The shard vanishes instantly if you are slain or if it is not in your possession for more than 24 consecutive hours. If the shard is destroyed or you lose it, you can perform a 1-hour ritual to create a replacement. This ritual can be performed as part of a short or long rest. The shard has a number of charges equal to your INT modifier (minimum of 1), and you regain all expended charges when you finish a long rest. Charges can be spent to activate the following properties. Inspire When you make an ability check while touching the shard (regardless of its current form), you can spend 1 charge to roll a d6 and add the number rolled to your check result. 54 PLAYER'S GUIDE Transform While touching the shard, you can use an action to transform it into any type of nonmagical weapon or shield or into any object of Medium size or smaller. The object appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, but the chosen space must contain a surface or liquid capable of supporting the object. If the object you create is of an appropriate size to be worn or held, you can choose for the object to appear in your hand or on your person. The total value (in gold pieces) of an object created can’t be more than 20 × your mechanist level.

A transformed shard remains in its new form until you die, use an action to return it to its original state, or use an action to transform it again. No matter what shape the shard assumes, those who handle the shard can sense something strange about its nature. The shard can’t be passed off as a typical item for purposes of buying and selling. AUGMENT 2nd-Level Mechanist Feature You gain the ability to channel magical energy into items. To use this ability, you must spend 1 hour focusing on the item that you wish to augment while remaining in physical contact with it (which can be done as part of a short or long rest). You gain two augment effects of your choice. Augment effect options are detailed at the end of the class description. At certain mechanist levels, you gain additional augment effects of your choice, as shown in the Augment Effects Known column of the Mechanist Progression table. When you use this ability, choose an effect from those you know. Regardless of the effect, an augmented item is considered a magic item while the effect remains active. You can apply these effects to existing magic items, and any bonuses or features granted by an augment effect stack with any properties a magic item already possesses. Unless specified otherwise, a chosen effect lasts indefinitely, but as an action, you can touch an item to end an ongoing effect that you created. You can have effects active on multiple items, provided you spend the required time focusing on each item individually. However, an item can only bear one effect at a time. Multiple uses of the same effect don’t stack. The maximum number of items you can affect with this feature at one time is listed in the Augmented Items column of the Mechanist Progression table. If you try to exceed your maximum, you must choose an ongoing effect to end. You can also augment your transformed shard of creation, provided its form meets the requirements for the chosen effect. The effect remains with the shard when it transforms as long as the new form remains compatible— if not, the effect immediately ends. EFFICIENT ACTION 2nd-Level Mechanist Feature Your mechanical expertise allows you to use items more efficiently in the chaos of battle. You can use a bonus action to take the Use an Object action (see Actions in Combat in Chapter 6) or to perform a weapon option (see Weapon Options in Chapter 5). 2 CLASSES 55 MECHANIST SUBCLASS 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th-Level Mechanist Feature Choose a subclass that reflects your relationship to your craft, either Metallurgist or Spellwright (detailed at the end of this class). Your choice grants you features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level. IMPROVEMENT 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th-Level Mechanist Feature Choose one of the following improvements (ability scores can’t be raised above 20 with this feature): • Increase a single ability score by 2. • Increase two different ability scores by 1 each. • Increase one ability score by 1 and select a talent from either the martial or the technical talents list (see Talents in Chapter 4). MULTIATTACK 5th-Level Mechanist Feature Your physical prowess has grown. On your turn, you can make two attacks when you take the Attack action. RAPID AUGMENT 6th-Level Mechanist Feature You can now use your Augment feature more rapidly. As a bonus action, you can touch an item and imbue it with a known augment effect of your choice. You remain bound by all other restrictions of the Augment feature, including number of items. You can use your Rapid Augment feature a number of times equal to your INT modifier and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. GREATER CREATION 9th-Level Mechanist Feature Your growing insight into the nature of reality allows you greater control over your Shard of Creation feature. You receive the following enhancements to its given properties. Inspire Your bonus to ability checks is now 1d8 (instead of 1d6). Transform You can now transform the shard into any Large or smaller tool or nonmagical object. All other restrictions still apply, including the limit on the gold piece value. HEROIC BOON 10th-Level Mechanist Feature Your commitment to the mechanist’s path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons: • Curse of Unmaking. As an action, you can make a melee spell attack using your augment attack modifier (see Augment Effects) against a creature or item within reach. On a successful hit, the target becomes cursed so that it is vulnerable to all damage. If the target is a creature, it can attempt a CON save against your augment save DC (see Augment Effects) each time it takes a new instance of damage, ending the curse on a success. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again. • Mend the Broken. As an action, you touch a creature or item and cause it to magically regain a number of hit points equal to 5 × your mechanist level. This effect also repairs any catastrophic damage suffered by the target, such as lost limbs, missing parts, or other harm that would ordinarily be irreparable. If the item doesn’t have a hit point total, your touch restores it to working order as best it can with the pieces available. This feature can’t restore expended charges on magic items or restore magical properties to nonmagical items that were once magical. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again. ENGINEER’S INSIGHT 13th-Level Mechanist Feature As long as you have at least 1 minute of uninterrupted focus on a task, when you make an ability check, treat any d20 roll of 9 or lower as though you rolled a 10. Normal activity like moving doesn’t interrupt focus, but attacking, taking damage, or participating in anything that requires initiative order does interrupt focus. RANGED AUGMENT 14th-Level Mechanist Feature You can now use your Rapid Augment feature on items you can see within 60 feet of you. (You no longer need to touch them.) In addition, if an effect from your Augment feature would typically require you to touch the item to activate its properties, you no longer need to do so as long as the item is within 60 feet of you. You don’t need to see the item to activate its properties in this way. ALWAYS PREPARED 17th-Level Mechanist Feature When you would take damage from an attack, you can use a reaction to take the Use an Object action. PERFECT CREATION 18th-Level Mechanist Feature Your growing insight into the nature of reality allows you greater control over your Shard of Creation feature. You receive the following enhancements to its given properties. Inspire Your bonus to ability checks is now 1d10 (instead of 1d8). Transform You can now transform the shard into any item— including structures and vehicles—of Huge size or smaller. You are no longer bound by any cost restrictions when choosing a form. 56 PLAYER'S GUIDE EPIC BOON 20th-Level Mechanist Feature Your commitment to the mechanist’s path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon: • Creative Engine. You gain a +1 bonus to your saves for each effect from your Augment feature currently active on items within 60 feet of you. If you fail a save while any of those items are within 60 feet of you, you can automatically end one of those effects (your choice) to succeed on the save instead. AUGMENT EFFECTS This section lists the effects available for mechanists to learn and use with their Augment feature. Each option lists the type of item required for the effect to function and provides a description of how the effect works. Any effects that require an action to activate their properties can be activated with the Use an Object action. Some effects require you to make an attack roll or require your target to make a save. The attack bonus and save DC for these is calculated as follows: Augment save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus (PB) + your Intelligence (INT) modifier Augment attack modifier = your proficiency bonus (PB) + your Intelligence (INT) modifier ADHESIVE Item Requirement: Large or Smaller Equipment or Object that Isn’t Being Worn or Held You imbue an item with the ability to stick to surfaces. While the item is within 30 feet of you, you can use an action to speak a command word and affix the item to a solid surface it is touching. The chosen surface can’t be part of a creature. While affixed, the item can support up to 1,000 pounds of weight. If additional weight is added, the item detaches from the surface (falling or moving as appropriate). A creature can spend an action to attempt to remove the affixed item with a STR (Athletics) check. The DC for this check equals 8 + your PB + your INT modifier. If a creature succeeds on this check, the item detaches from the surface. If the item isn’t forcefully detached, it remains attached for 24 hours or until you use an action to detach it. If the item is detached by any means, its adhesive properties can’t be activated again until you finish a long rest. COLLAPSIBLE Item Requirement: Large or Smaller Item that Isn’t Being Worn, Held, or Fixed in Place You imbue an item with the ability to become smaller. While you touch the item, you can use an action to reduce its size. When you do so, the target is halved in all dimensions, its weight is reduced to 1/8 of normal, and it decreases its size category by one, such as from Medium to Small. The target’s size can’t be reduced further by multiple uses of this feature. As an action, you can touch the target and cause it to return to its original size. At Higher Levels. Once you reach 9th level in the mechanist class, you can affect Huge or smaller items that meet the other requirements. DETECTING Item Requirement: Goggles, Glasses, Spyglass, or Similar Equipment or Object with a Transparent Surface You imbue an item with magical capabilities to enhance perception. While you touch the item, you can use an action to activate one of the listed effects. You must equip, wear, or actively look through the augmented item to gain the benefit of the chosen effect: • Darkvision. You gain darkvision out to a range of 30 feet. • Invisi-Vision. You can see invisible creatures and items as if they were visible. You are also aware of any creatures within 30 feet of you or if any creatures come within 30 feet of you, regardless of lighting conditions. • Magic Vision. You gain the benefits of the detect magic spell within 30 feet of you. • X-Ray Vision. You gain the ability to see through solid material within 30 feet of you. To you, solid items within that radius appear transparent and don’t prevent light from passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block your vision, as does a thin sheet of lead. While the augmented item is activated, you can use an action to deactivate it or switch the type of vision the item bestows. You can keep the item activated for up to 1 minute, all at once or in several shorter spans, each one using a minimum of 6 seconds (1 round) from the duration. The effect fully recharges when you finish a long rest. At Higher Levels. Once you reach 9th level in the mechanist class, the range of all vision effects increases to 60 feet. EMPOWERED Item Requirement: Weapon You imbue a weapon with offensive power. The weapon gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls. If it wasn’t already magical, it is now. If it was already magical, this bonus stacks with any existing bonuses. At Higher Levels. Once you reach 9th level in the mechanist class, the attack and damage bonus increases to +2. At 15th level, it becomes +3. ILLUSIVE Item Requirement: Large or Smaller Item You imbue an item with the ability to mask its true appearance. While you touch the target, you can use an 2 CLASSES 57 action to cause the item to appear as a different item of the same size and general composition. You can’t use this feature to change a target’s overall nature. For instance, a vehicle must always appear as another kind of vehicle, and equipment must appear as some other kind of equipment. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The change in appearance doesn't hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this effect to make a sharpened sword seem dull, anyone who touched the blade would be harmed as if they touched a fine-edged blade. To discern whether an item is disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect the item and must succeed on an INT (Investigation) check against your augment save DC. At Higher Levels. Once you reach 9th level in the mechanist class, you can affect Huge or smaller items. LOADING Item Requirement: Weapon with the Ammunition Property You imbue an item with the ability to conjure magic ammunition. When you wield the weapon, an appropriate piece of ammunition magically appears in place as you attack. Any damage dealt by this ammunition is considered magical. If you use this effect on a weapon with the Loading property, you don’t need to spend any time reloading the weapon. PHOSPHORESCENT Item Requirement: Small or Smaller Item that Can Be Worn or Held You imbue an item with the ability to glow. While the item is on your person, you can use an action to cause the item to emit bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. When you first activate the item, you can choose whether this light shines normally or whether it can only be seen by a number of creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you. The maximum number of creatures you can include equals your INT modifier. The light can be any color you choose. You can cause the item to stop emitting light at any time (no action required). At Higher Levels. Once you reach 9th level in the mechanist class, the radius increases to bright light in a 30‑foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. You can choose for the bright light to be sunlight (see Vision and Obscured Areas in Chapter 6). PROPULSIVE Item Requirement: Armor (not Shields) or Small or Smaller Object that Can Be Worn You imbue an item with the ability to increase the wearer’s speed. While wearing the augmented item, your base movement speed is increased by 5 feet. In addition, while you wear the item, you can use an action to move vertically up to 10 feet and remain suspended there for up to 1 minute. You can repeat this action on subsequent turns, rising up to an additional 10 feet each time you do so. While suspended, you can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed item or surface within reach (such as a wall or ceiling), which allows you to move as if you were climbing. When this effect ends or you choose to end it (no action required), you float gently to the ground if you are still aloft, and you can’t activate this Augment effect again until you finish a long rest. At Higher Levels. Once you reach 9th level in the mechanist class, the movement speed bonus increases to 10 feet. At 15th level, it becomes 20 feet. TYPES OF ITEMS Mechanist rules refer to items and sub-categories of items at various times, and those differences are important, so a clear understanding of the terms can help keep things on track. See the Interacting with Items section in Chapter 6 for more detail on different types of items. Item: This broad category includes many kinds of physical materials. All equipment, objects, structures, and vehicles are items. Most nonliving, constructed things a PC could encounter are items. Items can be divided into sub‑categories: • Equipment: A piece of equipment is a specific type of item that can be worn or wielded by PCs, such as most of the weapons, armor, tools, and adventuring gear described in Chapter 5. • Object: An object is a broad type of item that includes everyday things such as a barrel, a length of rope, or an iron door. An object typically has a size, hit points, and armor class, and it can be interacted with and broken. Reviewing Object and Structure Statistics section in Chapter 5 is helpful for understanding objects. • Structure: A structure is a type of item that is similar to an object, but it is usually large in scale and immobile, such as a wall, hut, or well. It typically has a size, hit points, and armor class, and it can be interacted with and destroyed. Reviewing the Object and Structure Statistics section in Chapter 5 is also helpful for understanding structures. • Vehicle: A vehicle is a type of item with its own stat block and governed by distinct mechanics, such as a boat or wagon. See Vehicles in Chapter 5 for more details. 58 PLAYER'S GUIDE PROTEAN Item Requirement: Weapon You imbue a weapon with the ability to change its damage type. When you successfully deal damage with the augmented weapon, you can replace the weapon’s damage type with another type of your choice. Damage altered in this way is always considered magical for purposes of overcoming resistances and immunities. You can use this augment effect a number of times equal to your PB and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. REACTIVE Item Requirement: Large or Smaller Item that Isn’t Being Worn, Held, or Fixed in Place You imbue an item with the ability to detect specific triggers and react in one of several ways. While you touch the item, you can use an action to set or change the item’s trigger and reaction. You can set the item to trigger when a creature you specify comes within 30 feet of it. This can be a specific creature you have met, such as “Jon the messenger,” a general visual description, such as “anyone wearing a city watch uniform,” or a creature type, such as “Celestials.” Your GM has final say on what is reasonable for a trigger. When triggered, you instantly become mentally aware that the item has been triggered, and the item can react in one of the following ways. At your GM’s discretion, an item might be able to react in other comparable ways: Recording. The item begins to record everything it can “see” and “hear” within 60 feet of it for the next hour, perceiving as a creature with typical vision or hearing could. After 1 hour, the item ceases to record new information and stores the recording until the item is no longer augmented or until you use an action to set a new trigger or reaction. While a recording is stored, you or any creature of your choosing can touch the item to mentally see and hear anything contained in the recording. Sound. The item emits a sound for up to 1 minute that can be heard to a range of 60 feet (you choose quality and range), such as the sound of ringing bells or a set of bird calls. Alternatively, you can cause it to emit a predetermined message of 25 words or less in your own voice. At Higher Levels. Once you reach 9th level in the mechanist class, the item can react when a specified creature comes within 60 feet of it. REINFORCED Item Requirement: Item with Hit Points You fortify an item. The target’s hit points and hit point maximum increase by an amount equal to 5 × your mechanist level. If the item is destroyed while this effect is active, the effect ends. RETURNING Target: Equipment or Object that Can Fit in the Hand and Isn’t Being Worn or Held You imbue an item with the ability to return to your hand. While the augmented item is within 60 feet, you can cause it to instantly teleport into your hand (no action required). You must have at least one hand free for this ability to function. At Higher Levels. Once you reach 9th level in the mechanist class, you can affect an item up to 120 feet away from you. At 15th level, you can affect an item anywhere on the same plane as you. REPELLANT Item Requirement: Shield You imbue an item with the ability to repel attackers. When a Large or smaller creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force the target to make a STR save against your augment save DC. On a failure, the creature is pushed 15 feet away from you. If the creature encounters a solid surface (like a wall) before moving the full amount, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning for each 10-foot increment it moved. At Higher Levels. Once you reach 9th level in the mechanist class, a target that fails its save is pushed 30 feet away from you. MECHANIST SUBCLASSES As you perfect your craft, you gain new abilities that reflect the specific ways you’ve learned to restructure the forces of the universe. Your choice of subclass speaks to the kinds of mystic creations you excel at making. METALLURGIST Mechanists who pursue the Metallurgist’s craft delight in the thrill of combat and engineered armaments. Metallurgist creations are awesome to behold in battle, though few enemies live to spread tales of their terrifying metal mechanisms. METALLURGIST PROGRESSION MECHANIST LEVEL FEATURES 3rd Augment: Absorbing, Mystic Metal 7th Heavy Hitter (d6) 9th Heavy Hitter (d8), Juggernaut 15th Full Metal, Heavy Hitter (d10) AUGMENT: ABSORBING 3rd-Level Metallurgist Feature You gain the following unique effect for your Augment feature. This effect can’t be replaced and doesn’t count against the number of effects that you know, as shown in the Augment Effects Known column of the Mechanist Progression table. 2 CLASSES 59 Absorbing Item Requirement: Armor or Shield You empower armor or a shield with the ability to absorb and adapt to different damage types. When you take a single instance of acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, poison, or thunder damage while wearing or wielding the item, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage taken by an amount equal to twice your INT modifier. You then gain resistance to the triggering damage type for 1 minute or until you use this feature to absorb a different damage type. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your PB, regaining all expended charges when you finish a long rest. MYSTIC METAL 3rd-Level Metallurgist Feature You learn to transmute armor into a mystical form. If you spend 1 hour of uninterrupted focus in contact with a nonmagical suit of armor (which can be done as part of a short or long rest), you can transmute that armor into a suit of mystic metal. The transformation lasts until you choose to end it or until you use this feature to transmute a different suit of armor. Any ongoing effects from your Augment feature on the armor automatically end when the armor reverts to its normal state. If anyone other than you attempts to don the mystic metal, it instantly reverts to its normal state. Once transformed, the mystic metal resembles a head-totoe suit of metallic armor, but you choose its color, style, and other cosmetic details. Regardless of appearance, mystic metal armor is not made of natural materials such as metal or wood. Therefore, it isn’t affected by magic like the heat metal spell or abilities like that of a rust monster. The mystic metal is lightweight and doesn’t hinder movement, and you are considered proficient with it. Your mystic metal functions as a magic suit of armor with the following properties: • Each gauntlet of the armor functions as a simple melee weapon with the Light property (which you are proficient with). You can choose whether you use your STR or INT modifier to determine the attack bonus and damage dealt by the gauntlets. On a successful hit, a gauntlet deals 1d6 + your STR or INT modifier (your choice) magical bludgeoning damage. • If it is on the same plane as you, you can use a bonus action to summon the armor. When you do so, you choose whether the armor appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you or if it appears on you, fully donned. If you are already wearing armor when you summon the mystic metal armor, it can’t appear on you. • While worn, the armor is attached to your body and can’t be removed against your will. • While you wear the armor, your AC equals 13 + your INT modifier. Creatures who handle or inspect the mystic metal can tell it isn’t a true magic item. Otherwise, it follows the rules of a typical magic item (see Magic Items in Chapter 5). HEAVY HITTER 7th-Level Metallurgist Feature You learn to upgrade the offensive capabilities of your Mystic Metal feature. While wearing the armor, you gain the following benefits: • When you deal damage with a weapon attack, you deal an additional 1d6 force damage. This extra damage increases at higher levels, becoming 1d8 at 9th level and 1d10 at 15th level. • When you make a weapon attack, you score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. JUGGERNAUT 11th-Level Metallurgist Feature While wearing the armor from your Mystic Metal feature, you have proficiency in the Athletics skill, and you have advantage on any check made to initiate a grapple or shove, or to perform any weapon option that requires a STR check. In addition, if you move at least 15 feet on your turn before making a melee weapon attack, you have advantage on the attack roll. FULL METAL 15th-Level Metallurgist Feature While wearing the armor from your Mystic Metal feature, you can use a bonus action to transform it into a nigh‑impervious state for 1 minute. If you are reduced to 0 HP, you can choose for the Full Metal feature to automatically activate (no action required). While this state is active, you are immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and you have resistance to all other damage types. Once this state is used, you can’t activate it again until you complete a long rest. SPELLWRIGHT Mechanists who pursue the Spellwright’s craft are fascinated by the intricacies of magic and its potential to enhance their creations. Spellwrights are the enchanters, tinkers, and crafters responsible for countless magic items found across the world. ARTIFICE INTUITION 3rd-Level Spellwright Feature When you wield a magic weapon (including those with active effects from your Augment feature), you can use your INT instead of STR or DEX to determine the weapon’s attack bonus and damage. 60 PLAYER'S GUIDE AUGMENT: IMBUE SPELL 3rd-Level Spellwright Feature You gain the following unique effect for your Augment feature. This effect can’t be replaced and doesn’t count against the number of effects that you know, as shown in the Augment Effects Known column of the Mechanist Progression table. Imbue Spell Item Requirement: Weapon, Shield, or Object that Can Be Worn or Held You imbue an item with spell-like offensive or defensive magical properties, choosing one of your known imbued spells (see Imbued Spells Known) when you do so. While holding the item, you—and only you—can take an action to produce the spell’s effect from it, using your spellcasting ability (see Spellcasting Ability). Any imbued spell you cast in this way is always cast at the highest circle you have access to via the Maximum Circle column of the Spellwright Progression table. If the imbued spell requires concentration, you must concentrate as the normal spellcasting rules (see Chapter 7: Spellcasting). You can use an imbued spell a number of times equal to your PB, regaining expended uses when you complete a long rest. Imbued Spells Known When you first gain access to this feature, choose two 1stcircle spells from the abjuration or evocation school. These are your imbued spells. They can be from any source— Arcane, Divine, Primordial, or Wyrd—but they must have a casting time of 1 action. You can’t cast these spells as a normal spellcaster would, but you know these spells for the purposes of use with this feature. You learn more imbued spells in this way as you progress in mechanist levels as shown on the Spellwright Progression table. Each imbued spell must be from the abjuration or evocation school and each must be from the same circle or lower as the circle listed in the Maximum Circle column. When you gain a new level of mechanist, you can replace one imbued spell you know with another spell of your choice that fits the required criteria. Spellcasting Ability Intelligence (INT) is your spellcasting ability. Your INT modifier determines the save DC or the attack modifier for your imbued spells: Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus (PB) + your Intelligence (INT) modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus (PB) + your Intelligence (INT) modifier ENERGY EFFICIENT 7th-Level Spellwright Feature When you cast a spell from a magic item (including items you have augmented), you can apply one of the following applicable benefits: • Casting the spell expends 1 fewer charge than the listed cost, to a minimum of 1 charge. • The spell deals additional damage equal to your INT modifier (of the same damage type as the spell). If the spell has multiple targets, you choose which target takes the additional damage. Don’t add this bonus more than once on the same casting. • Double your PB when determining the spell save DC for this casting of the spell. DEVICE SAVANT 11th-Level Spellwright Feature Your metaphysical understanding of magic items allows you to use them with ease. You ignore all restrictions on use of magic items, including class, lineage, level requirements, or access to specific spells. If an item requires you use of your spell save DC or spell attack modifier, use Intelligence (INT) as your spellcasting ability (see Spellcasting Ability in this subclass). OVERCHARGE 15th-Level Spellwright Feature When you cast one of your imbued spells, you can modify it in one of the following ways. Once you do so, you can’t modify that same spell again until you finish a long rest: • When you cast a spell that targets only you, you can choose to double the spell’s duration. • When you successfully hit a target with a spell attack or when a target fails to make its save against your spell, you can use your reaction to cause your spell to deal maximum damage (no roll required).

All monks possess a near-perfect understanding of their bodies and have deeper connections to the world that are indistinguishable from magic, be it anatomical, mystical, or occult in origin. Monk is a class that can more easily stand alone than others. Your class sports powerful attacks, strong defenses, and fast movement. MONKS AS ADVENTURERS Monks seek out ever greater understanding and challenges. Due to their strict adherence to personal improvement, monks are among the most self-sufficient class, prepared to take on a variety of obstacles and journeys. Though they’re capable warriors, most monks follow teachings or seek specific experiences that might not align with every party. The monk’s self-reliance, strict discipline, and morality might conflict with traveling companions intent on following materialistic desires. CLASS FEATURES As a monk, you have the following class features. HIT POINTS Hit Dice: 1d8 per monk level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your CON modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your CON modifier per monk level after 1st PROFICIENCIES Armor: None Weapons: Simple weapons, shortswords Tools: One of your choice Saves: STR, DEX Skills: Choose two from Acrobatics, Athletics, History, Insight, Religion, and Stealth STARTING EQUIPMENT You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: • (a) any simple weapon • (a) a dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack • (a) 10 darts or (b) a sling MARTIAL ARTS 1st-Level Monk Feature You have mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the Two-handed or Heavy property. You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield: • You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk Progression table. • You can use DEX instead of STR for attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons. • When you are hit by a ranged weapon attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage you take from the attack by 1d10 + your DEX modifier + your monk level. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the MONK QUICK BUILD To quickly create a monk, follow these steps during character creation: • For ability scores, prioritize DEX and then WIS. • For lineage and heritage, choose any combination you like. • For background and talent, choose Adherent and Mental Fortitude. 62 PLAYER'S GUIDE missile or thrown weapon if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. • When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. UNARMORED DEFENSE 1st-Level Monk Feature While you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your DEX modifier + your WIS modifier. TECHNIQUES 2nd-Level Monk Feature Your training gives you access to special techniques that allow you to amplify and manipulate the energy within yourself and the environment. Your ability to use this energy is represented by technique points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Technique Points column of the Monk Progression table. You can spend these points to fuel various techniques. You start knowing three techniques: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. You learn more technique features as you gain levels in this class. You recover \ expended technique points when you finish a short or long rest. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your technique points. Some of your techniques require your target to make a save to resist the technique’s effects. The save DC is calculated as follows: Technique save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus (PB) + your WIS modifier Flurry of Blows Immediately after you use an action on your turn, you can spend 1 technique point to make two unarmed strikes or make one attack with a monk weapon as a bonus action. Patient Defense You can spend 1 technique point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn. Step of the Wind You can spend 1 technique point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. When you do so, your jump distance is doubled until the start of your next turn (see Special Movement Rules in Chapter 6).

Epic Boon 2 CLASSES 63 UNARMORED MOVEMENT 2nd-Level Monk Feature Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk Progression table. MONK SUBCLASS 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th-Level Monk Feature Choose a subclass that reflects your method for connecting with the energies of the universe, either Flickering Dark or Open Hand (detailed at the end of this class). Your subclass grants you features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level. IMPROVEMENT 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th-Level Monk Feature • Choose one of the following improvements (ability scores can’t be raised above 20 with this feature): • Increase a single ability score by 2. • Increase two different ability scores by 1 each. • Increase one ability score by 1 and select a talent from the martial talents list (see Martial Talents in Chapter 4). MULTIATTACK 5th-Level Monk Feature Your physical prowess has grown. On your turn, you can make two attacks when you take the Attack action. STUNNING STRIKE 5th-Level Monk Feature You can interfere with the flow of energy in an opponent’s body. Once per turn, when you successfully hit another creature with an unarmed strike or monk weapon, you can spend 1 technique point to attempt to stun your foe. When you do so, the target takes damage from your attack as normal and then it must succeed on a CON save or be stunned until the end of your next turn. Each time a stunned target takes damage, it can repeat the save, ending the stunned effect on a success. EMPOWERED STRIKES 6th-Level Monk Feature Your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. EVASION 6th-Level Monk Feature You can dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a DEX save to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the save and only half damage if you fail. PERFECT MOTION 9th-Level Monk Feature While you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield, you gain the following benefits: • When you fall, you can use your reaction to reduce any falling damage you would take by an amount equal to 5 × your monk level. • You can move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move. If you end your movement or if your movement is interrupted while you are standing on a vertical surface or on liquid, you fall as normal. HEROIC BOON 10th-Level Monk Feature Your commitment to the monk’s path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons: • Purity of Body. Your mastery of the energy flowing through your body makes you immune to disease, poison damage, and the poisoned condition. In addition, when you are reduced to 0 HP but not killed outright, you can instantly reset your hit point total to your current number of technique points. You can’t recover hit points in this way again until you finish a long rest. 64 PLAYER'S GUIDE • Purity of Mind. The clearness of your mind gives you advantage on Wisdom saves. As a bonus action, you can end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened. ASTRAL TEACHINGS 13th-Level Monk Feature As an action, you can expend 2 technique points to become proficient in one language, skill, tool, or weapon of your choice until you are incapacitated or use this feature again. DIAMOND SOUL 14th-Level Monk Feature Your mastery of energy grants you proficiency in all saves. In addition, when you make a save and fail, you can spend 1 technique point to reroll it. You must take the second result. TIMELESS SELF 17th-Level Monk Feature Your spirit sustains you, body and mind. You gain the following benefits: • You can’t be magically aged and suffer none of the frailty of old age. You can still die of old age, however. • You no longer need food or water. • Your ability scores and hit point maximum can’t be lowered or reduced by any means short of a wish spell. EMPTY BODY 18th-Level Monk Feature You can use your action to spend 4 technique points to become invisible for 1 minute (see Appendix A: Conditions). During that time, you also have resistance to all damage but force damage. In addition, you can spend 8 technique points to cast the astral projection spell as an action (ignoring the standard casting time), without needing material components. When you do so, you can’t take any other creatures with you. EPIC BOON 20th-Level Monk Feature Your commitment to the monk’s path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon: • Boundless Technique. When you roll for initiative, you regain up to 4 expended technique points. If you start your turn with no technique points remaining, you regain 2 technique points. MONK SUBCLASSES Your mastery of mind and body has opened new insights into the nature of existence. Perhaps you began your studies into each of these disciplines long ago, but now, you might pursue them to the fullest. Two are presented here, the way of the Open Hand and the way of the Flickering Dark. FLICKERING DARK Those few monks who coax and feed the shadows from beyond the veil may bond with the all-consuming darkness. They can conjure life-devouring expanses of shadow, peer beyond the material world, and funnel that endless hunger into a strike that bridges the gap between here and beyond. FLICKERING DARK PROGRESSION MONK LEVEL FEATURES 3rd Dark Flame, Obsidian Eyes 7th Grace of Umbra 11th Feeding Dark 15th Strike of Searing Shadow DARK FLAME 3rd-Level Flickering Dark Feature As a bonus action, you can spend 2 technique points to shroud yourself in a 10-foot radius of coiling, flickering magical darkness. The darkness moves with you, remaining centered on you, and lasts for 1 minute. It can't be dispelled by a spell of 5th circle or lower. When you first summon the dark flames, choose one of the following properties: • Clawing Shadows. Creatures that enter the darkness for the first time on a turn or end their turn within it take necrotic damage equal to your martial arts damage die. You regain hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt. Constructs and Undead are unaffected. • Grasp of Nothingness. Your unarmed strikes deal additional necrotic damage equal to your PB. • Spreading Darkness. While the darkness is active, you can use an action to spend 1 technique point to cast the darkness spell without expending a spell slot or material component. This spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it (no action required). At 11th level, you can choose two options instead of one each time you use this feature. OBSIDIAN EYES 3rd-Level Flickering Dark Feature With 1 minute of quiet meditation (which can be done as part of a rest), you fill the eyes of a willing creature, including yourself, with inky black shadow. Until that creature finishes a long rest, it can see in dim light, darkness, and magical darkness as if it were bright light, to a distance of 60 feet. At 7th level, the target can see invisible creatures. At 11th level, the target can't be blinded. GRACE OF UMBRA 7th-Level Flickering Dark Feature A wisp of true darkness shrouds your movement. When you use your Step of the Wind technique, you become as 2 CLASSES 65 insubstantial as darkness until the end of your next turn. While you aren’t in sunlight, you and everything you’re carrying and wearing becomes intangible, and you can move through small holes, cracks, and narrow openings. In addition, you can spend 1 additional technique point as part of the same bonus action to teleport up to your speed to an unoccupied space that you can see within an area of dim light, darkness, or magical darkness. At 15th, level, you have resistance to all damage, except radiant, while this feature is active. FEEDING DARK 11th-Level Flickering Dark Feature Your hold over shadow siphons energy from those around you. Creatures that start their turn within an area of magical darkness created by you must succeed on a CON save or deal only half damage with weapon attacks that use STR or DEX until the end of its turn. Whenever a creature succeeds or fails its save against this feature, you can use your reaction to teleport up to 1 mile to a space adjacent to the target. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 3 technique points to do so. STRIKE OF SEARING SHADOW 15th-Level Flickering Dark Feature When you hit a target with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to spend 5 technique points. When you do, your strike carries a touch of infinite nothingness. The target must make a CON save, taking 3d10 fire damage and 3d10 necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of the target must succeed on a STR save against your technique save DC or take 2d10 force damage and be pulled up to 20 feet directly toward the target. When you reduce a creature to 0 HP with this feature, it is reduced to ash, and its shadow remains permanently affixed to the surface upon which it died. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to half the creature’s hit point maximum. OPEN HAND Monks of the Open Hand hone their bodies to physical perfection. They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents, practice advanced meditation to protect them from harm, and develop secret techniques to transform their bodies into the ultimate weapon. OPEN HAND PROGRESSION MONK LEVEL FEATURES 3rd Focus Intent, Open Hand Technique 7th Wholeness of Body 11th Tranquil Soul 15th Quivering Palm FOCUS INTENT 3rd-Level Open Hand Feature When you or a creature within 5 feet of you makes an ability check or attack roll, you can use your reaction to roll your martial arts die. The target gains a bonus or a penalty (your choice) to its roll equal to the number you rolled. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your WIS modifier. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. OPEN HAND TECHNIQUE 3rd-Level Open Hand Feature You can manipulate your enemy’s energy with your own. When you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows technique, you can impose one of the following effects on that target: • It can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn. • It must succeed on a DEX save or be knocked prone. • It must succeed on a STR save or be pushed up to 15 feet away from you. WHOLENESS OF BODY 7th-Level Open Hand Feature When you roll initiative and have at least 1 hit point, you regain a number of hit points equal to your CON modifier + your monk level. TRANQUIL SOUL 11th-Level Open Hand Feature You have learned the way of war, so you may better walk the world in peace. As an action, you can spend 3 technique points to cast the sanctuary spell on yourself. The spell lasts until the end of your next short or long rest (or it can end early as normal). QUIVERING PALM 15th-Level Open Hand Feature As an action, you can make a single unarmed strike against a creature. On a hit, you can spend 4 technique points to fill that creature with potentially lethal vibrations that last for a number of days equal to your monk level. For the duration, so long as you and the target are on the same plane, you can use an action to end the vibrations, ripping the creature apart. When you do, the target must make a CON save. On a failure, the target takes force damage equal to 5 × your monk level and is paralyzed until the end of your next turn. On a success, the target is stunned for 1 minute, and at the end of each of their turns, and each time they take damage, the target can repeat the save, ending the effect on a success. A target that fails the save by 5 or more instantly dies. Each time you use this feature after the first, the technique cost to use it increases by 2. When you finish a long rest, the cost resets. This feature can affect only one target at a time. 66 PLAYER'S GUIDE PALADIN Though many consider a life pursuing divinity to be a life of healing, learning, and worship, there are a few who pledge themselves as unbending instruments of a greater cause. These divinely guided warriors are called paladins, and each of them follows a set of principles—an oath sworn to a god, themselves, or the tides of fate. Paladin is a class that combines aspects of healing and fighting. Your class can hit very hard a small number of times, so stay in the thick of things to be useful when the moment comes up. PALADINS AS ADVENTURERS Paladins are versatile warriors with a variety of divine and martial abilities and proficiencies that make them perfect for a life of adventuring. They are hardy traveling companions, capable of shrugging off physical and mental strain, and they often possess rousing personalities and unshakable resolve that fortifies adventure, whether in backstabbing noble courts or monster-strewn badlands. Unlike clerics, paladins aren't bound to the sometimes‑mercurial whim of gods, but to an oath that allows them to act with utter surety.

HIT POINTS Hit Dice: 1d10 per paladin level Hit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your CON modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d10 (or 6) + your CON modifier per paladin level after 1st PROFICIENCIES Armor: All armor and shields Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons Tools: None Saves: WIS, CHA Skills: Choose two from Athletics, Insight, Intimidation, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion STARTING EQUIPMENT You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: • (a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons • (a) five javelins or (b) any simple melee weapon • (a) a priest’s pack or (b) an explorer's pack • Chain mail and a holy symbol DIVINE SENSE 1st-Level Paladin Feature During your turn, you can open your awareness to detect the presence of supernatural forces (no action required). For 1 minute, you know the location of any Celestial, Fiend, or Undead within 60 feet of you that isn’t behind total cover. You know the creature type of any being whose presence you sense, but you don’t know which specific creature it is. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated with the hallow spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your PB + 1. When you finish a long rest, you regain all uses. LAY ON HANDS 1st-Level Paladin Feature Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to 5 × your paladin level. As an action, you can touch a willing creature and draw from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of this feature, expending hit points separately for each one. As a bonus action, you can use this feature to affect yourself instead of a different creature. This feature has no effect on Constructs or Undead. DIVINE SMITE 2nd-Level Paladin Feature Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one Divine spell slot to deal extra radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s normal damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-circle spell slot, plus 1d8 for each circle higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is a Fiend or Undead. MARTIAL ACTION 2nd-Level Paladin Feature Your tactical expertise allows you to act quickly on the battlefield. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat to perform a weapon option (see Weapon Options in Chapter 5) or one of the martial actions granted by this feature. Choose one of the following martial actions that you know. Guard Requires Wielding a Shield As a bonus action, you raise your shield to intercept incoming attacks. Select one enemy creature within 5 feet of you. That creature has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes against you or an ally within 5 feet of you before the start of your next turn. Wind Up Requires Wielding a Heavy or a Versatile Weapon with Both Hands As a bonus action, you ready a powerful attack against a nearby target. Select one target you can see within 10 feet of you. If you hit that target with a melee weapon attack before the end of your turn, the first such attack deals extra damage equal to your PB (of the same damage type as the weapon). PALADIN QUICK BUILD To quickly create a paladin, follow these steps during character creation: • For ability scores, prioritize STR and then CHA. • For lineage and heritage, choose any combination you like. • For background and talent, choose Courtier and Combat Conditioning. 68 PLAYER'S GUIDE SPELLCASTING 2nd-Level Paladin Feature At 2nd level, you enhance your martial prowess with the ability to cast Divine spells. See Chapter 7: Spellcasting for general rules of spellcasting and the Divine spell list. Casting Spells You know a small number of spells and can cast any of them by using a Divine spell slot of the spell’s circle or higher. You don't need to prepare spells ahead of time. The Paladin Progression table shows how many spells you know and how many Divine spell slots you have at a given level. For example, at 5th level, you have four 1stcircle slots and two 2nd-circle slots. If you know the 1stcircle spell bless and have a 1st-circle and a 2nd-circle spell slot available, you can cast bless using either slot. If you use a 1st-circle slot, you have three 1st-circle slots remaining. You regain all used spell slots when you finish a long rest. Spellcasting Focus You can use a holy symbol (see Adventuring Gear in Chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your Divine spells. PALADIN SUBCLASS 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th-Level Paladin Feature Choose a subclass that reflects the oath you swear to uphold, either Devotion or Justice (detailed at the end of this class). Your choice grants you spells and other features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level. Oath Spells Each paladin subclass has a list of oath spells that you can access as soon as you can cast spells of that circle (as shown in the Paladin Progression table). Once you gain such a spell, it is always on your list of known spells, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you know. However, casting an oath spell still expends a Divine spell slot as normal. If one of these spells isn’t on the Divine spell list, it still counts as a Divine spell for you. You can’t replace oath spells when you gain a level of paladin. Channel Divinity Each paladin subclass gives you one or more ways to channel divine energy into magical effects, and each subclass explains how they work. When you use your Channel Divinity feature, choose which effect you want. Some of these effects require a save, and in those cases, the DC is equal to your spell save DC. Beginning at 13th level, you can use your Channel Divinity feature twice between rests, then three times at 18th level. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain any expended uses. IMPROVEMENT 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th-Level Paladin Feature Choose one of the following improvements (ability scores can’t be raised above 20 with this feature): • Increase a single ability score by 2. • Increase two different ability scores by 1 each. • Increase one ability score by 1 and select a talent from the martial talents list (see Martial Talents in Chapter 4). MULTIATTACK 5th-Level Paladin Feature Your physical prowess has grown. On your turn, you can make two attacks when you take the Attack action. AURA OF PROTECTION 6th-Level Paladin Feature When you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you makes a save, the creature gains a bonus to the save equal to your CHA modifier (minimum bonus of +1). You must PLAYER ADVICE Your Channel Divinity powers don’t require concentration unless the ability explicitly states that it does. An oath of Justice paladin can, at high levels, affect a single target or multiple targets with Burden of Guilt and Judgement, prioritizing damage on certain targets and limiting the escape ability of others. Spells Known of 1st Circle and Higher At 2nd level, choose two 1st-circle spells from the Divine spell list to learn. The Spells Known column of the Paladin Progression table shows when you learn additional Divine spells. Each spell you choose must be from a circle for which you have Divine spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level as a paladin, you can learn one new Divine spell from the 1st or 2nd circle. In addition, when you gain a level of paladin, you can choose one Divine spell you know and replace it with another spell of your choice from the Divine spell list. The replacement spell must be of a circle for which you have Divine spell slots. Spellcasting Ability Charisma (CHA) is your spellcasting ability. Your CHA modifier determines the save DC or the attack modifier for certain spells you cast: Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus (PB) + your CHA modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus (PB) + your CHA modifier 2 CLASSES 69 be conscious to grant this bonus. A creature can only receive the benefits of one Aura of Protection feature at a time (that is, auras from multiple paladins don’t stack). AURA OF COURAGE 9th-Level Paladin Feature You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened while you are conscious. HEROIC BOON 10th-Level Paladin Feature Your commitment to the paladin’s path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons: • Divine Recovery. When you heal a creature with your Lay on Hands feature, the target can expend one of their hit dice, roll the die, and add their CON modifier to it. The target regains that many hit points, in addition to any healing received from Lay on Hands. • Radiant Strikes. Your every strike is divinely empowered. When you hit a creature with a weapon, the attack deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage. Fiends and Undead instead take 2d8 radiant damage. This extra damage stacks with any damage from your Divine Smite feature. CLEANSING TOUCH 14th-Level Paladin Feature You can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature you touch. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your CHA modifier (minimum of one). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest. AURA IMPROVEMENTS 17th-Level Paladin Feature The range of your Aura of Protection and Aura of Courage features (and any auras granted by your paladin subclass) increases to 30 feet. EPIC BOON 20th-Level Paladin Feature Your commitment to the paladin’s path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon: • Aura of Salvation. As an action, you can exude a calming reassurance for 1 hour. While the aura is active, you and friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have resistance to nonmagical damage and automatically succeed on death saving throws. A creature with at least 1 HP that starts its turn in the aura regains hit points equal to your CHA modifier. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated or die. Once used, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. PALADIN SUBCLASSES When you have strengthened your resolve, pitted yourself against wickedness, and proven that fate is on your side, you will be ready to take your sacred oath. Each oath is both a set of principles to which you will strive and a reflection of manifestation of your divine powers. 70 PLAYER'S GUIDE Choose wisely, for breaking your oath may strip you of your powers until you right the wrong or overcome the adversity that broke your oath in the first place. DEVOTION Swearing an oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the principles of duty, honor, justice, and order. These paladins define themselves as holy warriors or knights, pledged to further a righteous cause to which they devote themselves. They typically hold angels, resplendent servants of good, in high regard, often adorning their armor, shield, or weapon with their iconography. TENETS OF DEVOTION Though the exact words and strictures of the oath of Devotion vary, its paladins share these tenets. Compassion. Protect the weak, aid the helpless, and show mercy to your enemies whenever you are able. Courage. Though caution is wise, never fear to act. Duty. Do always as you have sworn to do. Obey those who have authority over you. Honesty. Never tell a lie when the truth will suffice. Your word is your sacred promise. Honor. Treat others with fairness. Let your deeds prove your character. DEVOTION PROGRESSION PALADIN LEVEL FEATURES 3rd Channel Divinity: Sacred Weapon, Channel Divinity: Sanctifying Light, Devotion Oath Spells 7th Aura of Devotion 11th Purity of Spirit 15th Holy Nimbus CHANNEL DIVINITY 3rd-Level Devotion Feature You gain the following two Channel Divinity options. Channel Divinity: Sacred Weapon As an action, you can imbue one weapon you are holding with positive energy. For 1 minute, you add your CHA modifier to attack rolls you make with that weapon (minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the effected weapon isn’t already magical, it becomes magical for the duration. You can end this effect on your turn (no action required). It ends early if you fall unconscious. Channel Divinity: Sanctifying Light As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer to bathe yourself in a flash of holy light. Each Aberration, Fey, Fiend, and Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you that can see you must make a CHA save. If the creature fails its save, it is blinded for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, a target can make a CON save, ending the effect for itself on a success. DEVOTION OATH SPELLS 3rd-Level Devotion Feature You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Devotion Oath Spells table. See the Paladin Subclass class feature for how these spells work. DEVOTION OATH SPELLS PALADIN LEVEL SPELLS 3rd sanctuary 5th warding bond 9th protection from energy 13th stoneskin 17th mass cure wounds AURA OF DEVOTION 7th-Level Devotion Feature You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be charmed while you are conscious. This aura is enhanced by the 18th‑level Aura Improvements class feature. PURITY OF SPIRIT 11th-Level Devotion Feature Your connection to divinity gives you constant protection from the influence of supernatural creatures. You always have the following protections against Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, Undead, and creatures with the Outsider tag: • Listed creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. • You can use your Divine Sense feature to detect any listed creatures, not just Celestials, Fiends, and Undead. • You can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by listed creatures. HOLY NIMBUS 15th-Level Devotion Feature As an action, you can emanate a nimbus of sunlight. For 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light shines 30 feet beyond that. This light counts PLAYER ADVICE The Sacred Weapon feature can enhance ranged weapons as well as melee weapons. For example, if you use it on a longbow, the bow itself becomes the sacred weapon, so all arrows fired from it receive the bonus to attack rolls—you aren’t imbuing individual arrows with divine energy. 2 CLASSES 71 as true sunlight, such as when interacting with Sunlight Hypersensitivity, and it banishes areas of magical darkness created by the darkness spell or similar magic. When an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, it takes radiant damage equal to your paladin level. In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saves. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. JUSTICE Swearing an oath of Justice binds a paladin to the purpose of bringing great evil to justice. These paladins have been stripped of concerns for honor, piety, or purity—given free rein to oppose evil as they find prudent. They have promised themselves only to enact divine justice on those who bring harm and terror. Oftentimes, these paladins can be identified by the trappings with which they adorn themselves—ceremonial weapons, etchings of scripture, or vestments depicting their fallen enemies. TENETS OF JUSTICE Simple, sharp, and undeniable, the tenets of justice are as efficient as the paladins who swear them. Enacting them supersedes the paladin’s desires, fears, promises, and righteousness, so long as justice is served. Bury the Fallen. Put to rest anyone who falls while facing your sworn enemy. Excise the Wicked. Those who sow evil and terror must be destroyed. No Mercy. Forgiveness of evil is evil itself. JUSTICE PROGRESSION PALADIN LEVEL FEATURES 3rd Channel Divinity: Burden of Guilt, Channel Divinity: Judgement, Justice Oath Spells 7th Aura of Vigilance 11th Unworthy Adversary 15th Divine Executioner CHANNEL DIVINITY 3rd-Level Justice Feature You gain the following two Channel Divinity options. Channel Divinity: Burden of Guilt As a bonus action, you can call upon your divine power to curse a single foe you can see within 30 feet. For 1 minute, the target’s speed is halved. If it is flying at the end of its turn, it must succeed on a CHA save or fall to the ground. This effect ends early if you fall unconscious. Channel Divinity: Judgement As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to designate a single target within 10 feet of you as your divine quarry. For 1 minute, you have advantage on attack rolls against the target, and your weapon attacks against it deal additional radiant damage equal to your CHA modifier. This effect ends early if you deal damage to a creature other than the target of this feature. JUSTICE OATH SPELLS 3rd-Level Justice Feature You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed in the Justice Oath Spells table. See the Paladin Subclass class feature for how these spells work. JUSTICE OATH SPELLS PALADIN LEVEL SPELLS 3rd pendulum 5th misty step 9th haste 13th greater invisibility 17th greater hold AURA OF VIGILANCE 7th-Level Justice Feature While you aren't incapacitated, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you gain a bonus to initiative rolls equal to your proficiency bonus. This aura is enhanced by the 18th‑level Aura Improvements class feature. UNWORTHY ADVERSARY 11th-Level Justice Feature When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack against an ally, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed toward the attacking creature. If the attacking creature is the target of the Judgement effect of your Channel Divinity feature, you can make a weapon attack against that creature as part of the same reaction. DIVINE EXECUTIONER 15th-Level Justice Feature Using your action, you can channel the full might of order, balance, and righteous violence into yourself and become an instrument of decisive justice. You gain the following benefits for 1 hour: • Each time you deal damage, you can reroll the damage, but you must use the new result. • When you take the attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as part of that action. • When an enemy you can see within 10 feet of you deals damage to you or an ally within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to force that creature to also take half the damage it dealt, of the same damage type. Once used, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest. 72 PLAYER'S GUIDE RANGER Rangers are unparalleled explorers with a mystical connection to the natural world. A combination of martial prowess, spellcasting, and supernatural awareness ensures rangers excel as scouts, trackers, and hunters. Few classes prove as deadly as a ranger once their quarry is within sight. Ranger is a class that blends features from multiple classes and has plenty of opportunity for customization. Your class features lend themselves to creating a skirmisher, archer, or warrior focused on high-utility magic. RANGERS AS ADVENTURERS Rangers are born adventurers. No class is better suited to surviving the rigors of the wild than a ranger, and their excellent survival skills are often the difference between life and death for adventuring parties far from civilization. While rangers shine outside of combat, they also possess an impressive array of martial abilities. They might lack the brawn of fighters or full spellcasting abilities of druids, but they make up for it with excellent damage output and mobility. CLASS FEATURES As a ranger, you have the following class features. HIT POINTS Hit Dice: 1d10 per ranger level Hit Points at 1st Level: 10 + your CON modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d10 (or 6) + your CON modifier per ranger level after 1st PROFICIENCIES Armor: Light armor, medium armor, and shields Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons Tools: Your choice of herbalist tools, navigator tools, or trapper tools Saves: STR, DEX Skills: Choose three from Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Investigation, Nature, Perception, Stealth, and Survival STARTING EQUIPMENT You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: • (a) scale mail or (b) leather armor • (a) two shortswords or (b) two simple weapons • (a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack • A longbow and quiver of 20 arrows EXPLORER 1st-Level Ranger Feature Your ability to deal with environmental challenges is unmatched. You gain the following benefits: • You gain either a climbing speed or swimming speed equal to your base movement speed. • You have advantage on checks to track a creature (see Tracking in Chapter 6). • Your speed isn’t halved when you move through nonmagical or magical difficult terrain. You suffer other penalties caused by moving through difficult terrain as normal. MYSTIC MARK 1st, 6th, 13th, and 17th-Level Ranger Feature When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can mystically mark it as your favored quarry. The creature remains marked for 1 minute, until you use this feature to mark a different creature, or until you become incapacitated. 2 CLASSES 73 While a creature is marked (including for the attack that triggered the mark), you deal an extra 1d4 damage to it (of the same damage type as the weapon) each time you successfully hit it with a weapon attack. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your PB. You regain all uses when you finish a long rest. This extra damage increases as you gain ranger levels, becoming 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 13th, and 1d10 at 17th. MARTIAL ACTION 2nd-Level Ranger Feature Your tactical expertise allows you to act quickly on the battlefield. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat to perform a weapon option (see Weapon Options in Chapter 5) or one of the martial actions granted by this feature. Choose one of the following martial actions that you know. Aim Requires Wielding a Ranged or Thrown Weapon As a bonus action, you take the time to increase the effectiveness of your next ranged weapon attack. Select one target you can see. If you make a ranged weapon attack against that target before the end of your turn, double your PB for the first attack roll. Quick Strike Requires Wielding Two Light Weapons After you take the Attack action on your turn and attack with a Light melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to make two attacks with a different Light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand—instead of the one attack typically granted by two-weapon fighting. Don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of these additional attacks unless the modifier is negative. RANGER QUICK BUILD To quickly create a ranger, follow these steps during character creation: • For ability scores, prioritize DEX and then WIS. • For lineage and heritage, choose any combination you like. • For background and talent, choose Homesteader and Far Traveler.

See Chapter 7: Spellcasting for general rules of spellcasting and the Primordial spell list. Casting Spells You know a small number of spells and can cast any of them by using a Primordial spell slot of the spell’s circle or higher. You don't need to prepare spells ahead of time. The Ranger Progression table shows how many spells you know and how many Primordial spell slots you have at a given level. For example, at 5th level, you have four 1st-circle slots and two 2nd-circle slots. If you know the 1st-circle spell animal friendship and have a 1st-circle and a 2nd-circle spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot. If you use a 1st-circle slot, you have three 1st-circle slots remaining. You regain all used spell slots when you finish a long rest. Spells Known of 1st Circle and Higher At 2nd level, choose two 1st-circle spells from the Primordial spell list that you know. The Spells Known column of the Ranger Progression table shows when you learn additional Primordial spells. Each spell you choose must be from a circle for which you have Primordial spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level as a ranger, you can learn one new Primordial spell from the 1st or 2nd circle. In addition, when you gain a level of ranger, you can choose one Primordial spell you know and replace it with another spell of your choice from the Primordial spell list. The replacement spell must be of a circle for which you have Primordial spell slots. Spellcasting Ability Wisdom (WIS) is your spellcasting ability. Your WIS modifier determines the save DC or the attack modifier for certain spells you cast: Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus (PB) + your WIS modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus (PB) + your WIS modifier Spellcasting Focus You can use a druidic focus (see Adventuring Gear in Chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your Primordial spells. RANGER SUBCLASS 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th-Level Ranger Feature Choose a subclass that reflects your connection to the natural world, either Hunter or Pack Master (detailed at the end of this class). Your choice grants you spells and other features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level. Calling Spells Each ranger subclass has a list of calling spells that you can access as soon as you can cast spells of that circle (as shown in the Ranger Progression table). Once you gain such a spell, it is always on your list of known spells, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you know. However, casting a calling spell still expends a Primordial spell slot as normal. If one of these spells isn’t on the Primordial spell list, it still counts as a Primordial spell for you. You can’t replace calling spells when you gain a level of ranger. IMPROVEMENT 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th-Level Ranger Feature Choose one of the following improvements (ability scores can’t be raised above 20 with this feature): • Increase a single ability score by 2. • Increase two different ability scores by 1 each. • Increase one ability score by 1 and select a talent from either the martial or the technical talents list (see Talents in Chapter 4). MULTIATTACK 5th-Level Ranger Feature Your physical prowess has grown. On your turn, you can make two attacks when you take the Attack action. EMPOWERED MARK 6th-Level Ranger Feature Your instincts have sharpened, granting you supernatural awareness of your quarry. While a creature marked by your Mystic Mark feature is within 60 feet of you, you know its exact location, and it can’t gain advantage on attacks against you as a result of being invisible or otherwise unseen. In addition, when you attack a marked creature within 60 feet of you, an inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. STALKER’S STEP 9th-Level Ranger Feature While you are in dim light, darkness, or are lightly obscured or heavily obscured by foliage, mist, or some other natural phenomenon, you can use a bonus action to magically become invisible (see Appendix A: Conditions), along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, until the start of your next turn. This invisibility ends early if you attack or cast a spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your PB and regain all uses when you complete a long rest. 2 CLASSES 75 HEROIC BOON 10th-Level Ranger Feature Your commitment to the ranger’s path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons: • Path of the Predator. When you roll initiative, you can expend a use of Mystic Mark to automatically mark one creature you can see, no attack required. In addition, if a marked creature is reduced to 0 HP, you can use your reaction to transfer the mark to a different creature you can see within 60 feet of the original target. • Path of the Sage. You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Primordial spell list. You also learn two ritual spells of your choice from the Primordial spell list. Both ritual spells must be from circles you have spell slots for, as shown on the Ranger Progression table. Ritual spells learned this way don't count against your total number of spells known. WIS is your spellcasting ability for cantrips and ritual spells learned in this way. When you gain a level of ranger, you can replace one of these cantrips and one of these rituals with another cantrip or ritual spell from the Primordial spell list, as long as the replacement ritual spell is still of a circle you have spell slots for. KEENSENSE 14th-Level Ranger Feature You have keensense (see Special Senses in Chapter 6) to a range of 10 feet. Your keensense ceases to function while you are deafened (see Appendix A: Conditions) or otherwise deprived of hearing. STRIDER 18th-Level Ranger Feature Your movement never provokes opportunity attacks, and you have advantage on any check made to resist an effect that would cause you to become grappled, restrained, or paralyzed or that would otherwise reduce your movement speed to 0 feet (see Appendix A: Conditions). EPIC BOON 20th-Level Ranger Feature Your commitment to the ranger’s path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon: • Foe Slayer. You can add your WIS modifier to either the attack roll or the damage roll of each attack you make against a creature marked by your Mystic Mark on your turn. RANGER SUBCLASSES As a ranger fosters their skills, they gain new abilities that reflect their deepening relationship with the natural world. Your choice of subclass represents the way your connection to the Primordial manifests. HUNTER Rangers who heed the calling of the Hunter are no mere trappers or furriers. They are the last line of defense between the natural and the supernatural world. Hunters seek, stalk, and slay monstrous predators like outsiders, fiends, and undead who devastate populations with their malign magic. HUNTER PROGRESSION RANGER LEVEL FEATURES 3rd Hunter Calling Spells, Killer Instinct, Relentless Pursuit 7th Favored Foe 11th No Escape 15th Predator’s Shield HUNTER CALLING SPELLS 3rd-Level Hunter Feature You gain calling spells at the ranger levels listed in the Hunter Calling Spells table. See the Ranger Subclass class feature for how these spells work. HUNTER CALLING SPELLS RANGER LEVEL SPELLS 3rd protection from evil and good 5th misty step 9th nondetection 13th banishment 17th greater hold KILLER INSTINCT 3rd-Level Hunter Feature As a bonus action, choose a creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. You immediately learn the creature’s immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities, or you learn if it has none. This feature doesn’t function if the target is magically concealed by a nondetection spell or similar effect that counters divination magic. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your PB and regain all uses of it when you finish a long rest. RELENTLESS PURSUIT 3rd-Level Hunter Feature Your tenacity wears down even potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you deal extra damage if the target is below its hit point maximum. The extra damage is equal to the amount your Mystic Mark feature deals at your level and is of the same damage type as the weapon. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn. 76 PLAYER'S GUIDE FAVORED FOE 7th-Level Hunter Feature As part of a long rest, you can spend time reviewing your research and preparing to face a specific type of monster. Choose a type of enemy: Aberration, Beast, Celestial, Construct, Dragon, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, Giant, Monstrosity, Ooze, Plant, or Undead. For 24 hours, creatures of that type have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. You also have advantage on saves against being charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. At the end of your next long rest, you can choose the same type of creature or a different creature type as your Favored Foe. NO ESCAPE 11th-Level Hunter Feature When a creature marked by your mystic mark attempts to move, you can use your reaction to magically teleport up to 30 feet. If you teleport to a space within your weapon’s reach of the target, you can immediately make an opportunity attack as part of the same reaction. PREDATOR’S SHIELD 15th-Level Hunter Feature When you take damage from a creature you can see, you can use your reaction to supernaturally ward yourself against that creature for a short time. You have resistance to all damage dealt by the target for 1 minute, including resistance to the damage dealt by the triggering attack. This effect ends early if you become incapacitated. Once used, this feature can’t be used again until you finish a long rest. PACK MASTER Pack masters rarely choose this calling, rather they are chosen by it. Rangers who heed the call of the Pack Master are the appointed guardians of wild creatures. They naturally move to defend the interests of the wild and gain the service of a spirit creature. PACK MASTER PROGRESSION RANGER LEVEL FEATURES 3rd Beast Spirit, Life Link, Pack Master Calling Spells 7th Shared Mark 11th Soul Bond 15th Undying Friendship BEAST SPIRIT 3rd-Level Pack Master Feature You learn a ritual that allows you to bind a beast spirit into a physical form to fight alongside you as a trusted companion. The ritual takes 1 hour to complete and can be done as part of a short or long rest. Once the ritual is complete, the spirit appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you. You choose whether the spirit assumes an avian, agile, aquatic, or sturdy form. Your choice of form affects the creature’s statistics, as shown in the beast spirit stat block. Your choice also affects how the spirit looks, causing it to resemble a Medium animal of your choice that suits the chosen form. As part of a long rest, you can change the spirit’s form. The spirit has the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak, and you can communicate with it telepathically while it is within 1 mile of you. The beast spirit is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. See this creature’s statistics in the beast spirit stat block, which uses your PB in several places. In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger. 2 CLASSES 77 The spirit has a number of hit dice (d10s) equal to your ranger level. It can spend these Hit Dice to recover hit points during a short rest just as a PC would. It recovers all hit points during a long rest. If the spirit is reduced to 0 hit points, its body is instantly destroyed, and you must perform the 1-hour ritual to create a new body for it. The new body appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you, assuming the form it had when it was destroyed or a different form of your choosing. Even though it receives a new body, the spirit retains its memories and personality, unless you decide otherwise. Beast Spirit CR — Medium Beast Armor Class 11 + your PB (natural armor), 13 + your PB in Sturdy Form Hit Points 5 + five × your ranger level (the companion has a number of Hit Dice [d10s] equal to your ranger level) Perception 12 Stealth 14 Speed 30 ft., climb 30 ft. (Agile only); fly 60 ft. (Avian only); swim 30 ft. (Aquatic only) Senses darkvision 60 ft. Languages understands the languages you speak STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA +4 +0 +3 −3 +2 −3 Agile Form. The spirit has a climbing speed equal to its walking speed and has advantage on saves to avoid being knocked prone. Aquatic Form. The spirit has a swimming speed equal to its walking speed and can hold its breath for up to 20 minutes. Avian Form. The spirit has a flying speed equal to its walking speed. Carrying a heavy load or creature of its size or larger while flying reduces its speed by half. Sturdy Form. The spirit has a natural AC 13 + your PB. In addition, the creature counts as one size larger when determining its carrying capacity and the weight it can push or drag. ACTIONS Multiattack. The spirit makes a number of attacks equal to half your PB (rounded down). Natural Weapons. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 + your PB to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 + your PB (1d8 + 4 + your PB) damage. You decide whether this attack deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage when you choose the spirit’s form. LIFE LINK 3rd-Level Pack Master Feature Your connection to your companion allows you to ease its injuries by taking on some of its pain. When your beast spirit takes damage while you are within 30 feet of it, you can use your reaction to take any amount of that damage instead. Damage you take in this way isn’t reduced by any resistances or immunities you have. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your PB. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. PACK MASTER CALLING SPELLS 3rd-Level Pack Master Feature You gain calling spells at the ranger levels listed in the Pack Master Calling Spells table. See the Ranger Subclass class feature for how these spells work. PACK MASTER CALLING SPELLS RANGER LEVEL SPELLS 3rd animal friendship 5th wildsense 9th spirit guardians 13th polymorph 17th dominate SHARED MARK 7th-Level Pack Master Feature Time spent with your companion has deepened your mystical connection. Your beast spirit’s attacks now count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance or immunity to nonmagical attacks. In addition, while a creature is marked by your Mystic Mark feature, your beast spirit deals an extra 1d6 damage to it each time it successfully hits the target with a weapon attack. This extra damage scales at the same rate as yours, becoming 1d8 when you reach 13th level and 1d10 when you reach 17th level in the ranger class. SOUL BOND 11th-Level Pack Master Feature When you are targeted by a spell, you can choose for your beast spirit to also be targeted, if it is within 30 feet of you when the spell is cast, receiving the same benefits as you. In addition, when you cast a spell without a range of self, your beast spirit can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. It must still be within 100 feet of you and must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll or save, use your spellcasting modifier and spell save DC. UNDYING FRIENDSHIP 15th-Level Pack Master Feature If you are reduced to 0 HP or killed outright while your beast spirit is active, you can choose to allow your beast spirit to sacrifice itself. If you do so, the beast spirit’s body is destroyed, and you return to life with a number of hit points equal to the number of hit points your spirit had when it was destroyed. When a spirit is destroyed in this way, you must complete a long rest before you can perform the 1-hour ritual required to create a new body for it. 78 PLAYER'S GUIDE ROGUE Rogues are clever and cunning with a wide array of skills. Their broad expertise makes them well suited for challenges that can’t be overcome by either brute force or magic. There’s no “standard” rogue; they come in all sizes and dispositions. Rogue is a class that can shine out of combat, but you remain fearsome in the fight. Your class needs someone else around to draw fire, though. Don’t get too far away from allies once weapons come out. ROGUES AS ADVENTURERS Rogues are jacks-of-all-trades who thrive in high-pressure situations—perfect adventurer qualities. Given the nature of their skill set, rogues are drawn to adventure. No class is better suited to bypassing obstacles quickly and quietly, whether confronted with a locked door, a trapped hallway, or a dozing guard. A rogue’s strength in combat relies on agility and precision. They can’t hold down a front line for long. However, when allowed to play to their strengths, they dart around the battlefield, positioning to make deadly strikes against unprotected flanks. CLASS FEATURES As a rogue, you have the following class features. HIT POINTS Hit Dice: 1d8 per rogue level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your CON modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your CON modifier per rogue level after 1st PROFICIENCIES Armor: Light armor Weapons: Simple weapons, martial weapons with the Finesse property Tools: Thieves’ tools Saves: DEX, INT Skills: Choose four from Acrobatics, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth STARTING EQUIPMENT You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: • (a) a rapier or (b) a shortsword • (a) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (b) a shortsword • (a) a burglar’s pack, (b) a dungeoneer’s pack, or (c) an explorer’s pack • Leather armor, two daggers, and a set of thieves’ tools EXPERTISE 1st and 6th-Level Rogue Feature Choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one skill proficiency and one tool proficiency. Double your PB for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies. At 6th level, choose two more of your proficiencies (any combination of skills or tools) to gain this benefit. SNEAK ATTACK 1st-Level Rogue Feature You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The weapon you use must have the Finesse property or be a ranged weapon. You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll. The amount of your extra damage you deal increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue Progression table. 2 CLASSES 79 THIEVES’ CANT 1st-Level Rogue Feature During your rogue training, you learned Thieves’ Cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature who knows Thieves’ Cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey a message in Thieves’ Cant than it does to speak the same idea plainly. In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run. CUNNING ACTION 2nd-Level Rogue Feature Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action (see Combat in Chapter 6). ROGUE SUBCLASS 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th-Level Rogue Feature Choose a subclass that represents your specialized set of skills, either Enforcer or Thief (detailed at the end of this class). Your choice grants you features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level. IMPROVEMENT 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th-Level Rogue Feature Choose one of the following improvements (ability scores can’t be raised above 20 with this feature): • Increase a single ability score by 2. • Increase two different ability scores by 1 each. • Increase one ability score by 1 and select a talent from the technical talents list (see Technical Talents in Chapter 4). ROGUE QUICK BUILD To quickly create a rogue, follow these steps during character creation: • For ability scores, prioritize DEX and then either STR (if you plan to take Enforcer subclass) or any other ability. • For lineage and heritage, choose any combination you like. • For background and talent, choose Outcast and either Aware (if you plan to take Enforcer subclass) or Touch of Luck.

Examples of such signs are shown here. Thieves' Guild Closed Eye Secret Door Flame Trap UNCANNY DODGE 5th-Level Rogue Feature When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the attack’s damage against you by half. EVASION 6th-Level Rogue Feature You can dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a DEX save to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the save and only half damage if you fail. 80 PLAYER'S GUIDE RELIABLE TALENT 9th-Level Rogue Feature You have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. When you make an ability check with a skill, tool, or vehicle that you have proficiency with, treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as if you rolled a 10. HEROIC BOON 10th-Level Rogue Feature Your commitment to the rogue’s path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons: • Escape Artist. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make any kind of save (including DEX saves) to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the save and only half damage if you fail. • Jack of All Trades. When you gain a new talent, you can choose it from any talent list. Immediately gain one talent of your choice (that you meet the prerequisites for) when you gain this feature. PRECISE CRITICAL 13th and 17th-Level Rogue Feature You score a critical hit on a d20 roll of 19 or 20 with ranged weapons and weapons with the Finesse property. In addition, you can roll one additional weapon damage die (not an additional Sneak Attack die) when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a ranged weapon attack or attack made with a Finesse weapon. This extra damage increases to two additional dice at 17th level. KEENSENSE 14th-Level Rogue Feature You have keensense (see Senses in Chapter 6) to a range of 10 feet. Your keensense ceases to function while you are deafened (see Appendix A: Conditions) or otherwise deprived of hearing. ELUSIVE 18th-Level Rogue Feature You are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. While you aren’t incapacitated, attack rolls can’t have advantage against you, regardless of the source of advantage. EPIC BOON 20th-Level Rogue Feature Your commitment to the rogue’s path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon: • Stroke of Luck. You have got it when it counts. If your attack misses a target within normal range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. ROGUE SUBCLASSES Not all rogues are criminals, but the long history of rogues working on the wrong side of the law carries forward in discussion of your roguish specialties. Your subclass represents the brand of skullduggery you bring to the table, typically (but not necessarily) in the context of a criminal operation. ENFORCER Enforcers excel at practical violence. Whether plying their trade as bounty hunters, assassins, or mercenaries, rogues of this specialty strive to make their bloody craft efficient and effective. ENFORCER PROGRESSION ROGUE LEVEL FEATURES 3rd Ambush, Cold-Blooded, Expanded Talent List 7th Brawler 11th Ready to Rumble 15th Kill Shot AMBUSH 3rd-Level Enforcer Feature During the first round of combat, you have advantage on the first attack roll you make against any creature involved in the combat. In addition, when you make a successful attack roll against a creature with the surprised condition, that attack is automatically considered a critical hit. COLD-BLOODED 3rd-Level Enforcer Feature Once per turn when you reduce a creature to 0 HP with a weapon attack, you can use the same weapon to immediately make an additional weapon attack against a different creature you can see within your weapon’s normal range. You can’t add Sneak Attack damage to this additional attack, even if circumstances would normally allow you to do so. EXPANDED TALENT LIST 3rd-Level Enforcer Feature When you gain a new talent, you can select that talent from either the martial or the technical talents list (see Talents in Chapter 4). BRAWLER 7th-Level Enforcer Feature You can now use your Sneak Attack feature against a target within 5 feet of you even if no other creatures (besides the target) are within 5 feet of you. You don’t need to have advantage on the attack roll, but you can’t have disadvantage on it. All other required conditions for Sneak Attack still apply. 2 CLASSES 81 In addition, you can now use your Sneak Attack feature with unarmed strikes (in addition to ranged weapons and weapons with the Finesse property). READY TO RUMBLE 11th-Level Enforcer Feature You have advantage on DEX checks made to determine your place in initiative order. As long as you aren’t incapacitated, you can’t be surprised (see Appendix A: Conditions). KILL SHOT 15th-Level Enforcer Feature When you roll Sneak Attack damage, you can reroll any number of the dice, but you must take the new result. In addition, you can apply your Sneak Attack feature to any eligible weapon attack you make as part of an attack of opportunity if you haven’t already used your Sneak Attack during the round. THIEF You have a reputation for quick thinking and quicker fingers. Leave throat-cutting and con-running to lesser scoundrels. You live to liberate treasures held under lock and key. The thrill of bypassing a sealed door, complex trap, or other “impassable” obstacle is the true prize—followed by the payday that comes from whatever you took. THIEF PROGRESSION ROGUE LEVEL FEATURES 3rd Fast Hands, Second-Story Work 7th Appraising Eye 11th Trap Specialist 15th Thief’s Reflexes FAST HANDS 3rd-Level Thief Feature Experience has honed your skills, allowing you to accomplish precision work in a flash. In addition to its standard uses, you can now use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action feature to do any of the following: • Make a DEX (Sleight of Hand) check. • Take the Use an Object action. • Use thieves’ tools to attempt to disarm a trap or open a lock. SECOND-STORY WORK 3rd-Level Thief Feature You’ve never met a wall you couldn’t conquer, and climbing them is second nature. You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. If you already have a climbing speed when you gain this feature, it increases by 10 feet. In addition, when you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet equal to your walking speed if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap half your walking speed. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In the event a STR (Athletics) check is required to clear or extend a jump, you can choose to make a DEX (Acrobatics) check instead. APPRAISING EYE 7th-Level Thief Feature You’ve developed an eye for quality. As an action, you can inspect any object within 10 feet of you that you can see to learn whether it is nonmagical or magical. If the object is nonmagical, you immediately learn its approximate value in gold pieces. You also learn whether the object is fake or could conceal other objects inside it (though you don’t learn whether it is currently concealing objects or what those objects are). If the object is magical, you can spend 1 minute examining it to learn its type, rarity, whether it is cursed, and if it requires attunement (and any specific attunement requirements it has). After you have examined a magic item in this way, you learn how to use it and can ignore any class or feature requirements that would normally prevent you from using it (though you still must abide by any level restrictions). If a magic item requires the use of a spellcasting ability, use your DEX to determine your spell save DC or spell attack bonus. TRAP SPECIALIST 11th-Level Thief Feature When you or a creature within 5 feet of you triggers a trap, you can use your reaction to roll an ability check to attempt to disarm the trap. If you are successful, the trap is disarmed and not triggered. If you are unsuccessful, the trap is triggered as normal. In addition, you can now disarm any magical traps that would typically require the use of the dispel magic spell. When you do so, make an ability check using only your DEX modifier, without adding any other modifiers to the roll. If the result meets or exceeds the trap’s DC (your GM has this number), it is disarmed as if you had successfully cast the dispel magic spell. THIEF’S REFLEXES 15th-Level Thief Feature You have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. Now, you can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this feature if you are surprised (see Appendix A: Conditions). 82 PLAYER'S GUIDE SORCERER Though magic courses through all things, some people are so intrinsically tied to it that they can command magic through force of will. These spellcasters, called sorcerers, feel magic coursing through them just as they might feel their own heartbeat. Sorcerer is a class that revolves around manipulating the game mechanics of spells, changing up timing, distance, targets, and effects. Your class doesn't give you a variety of spells, but this is not a hard limit on your play options. SORCERERS AS ADVENTURERS Sorcerers command a masterful control over a small reservoir of magic. No god, patron, book, or instrument holds sway over a sorcerer’s magical abilities. They are versatile, reliable spellcasters capable of harnessing extremely potent magic as a part of their being. Though most sorcerers embrace a life of adventure, they must rely on the skills, abilities, and equipment of others to truly thrive. Those who travel with the sorcerer must watch them closely, for the allure of power can overtake an otherwise amenable nature. CLASS FEATURES As a sorcerer, you have the following class features. HIT POINTS Hit Dice: 1d6 per sorcerer level Hit Points at 1st Level: 6 + your CON modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d6 (or 4) + your CON modifier per sorcerer level after 1st PROFICIENCIES Armor: None Weapons: Simple weapons Tools: None Saves: CON, CHA Skills: Choose two from Arcana, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Persuasion, and Religion STARTING EQUIPMENT You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: • (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon • (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus • (a) a dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack • Two daggers FONT OF MAGIC 1st-Level Sorcerer Feature You begin to draw from an internal wellspring of magic. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects. Sorcery Points You start with 2 sorcery points at 1st level, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer Progression table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown in the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest. Flexible Casting You can sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points or use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels. Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points. As a bonus action, you can expend one Arcane spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the spell slot’s circle. Creating Spell Slots. You can spend sorcery points to gain one Arcane spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given circle. You can create spell slots no higher than 5th circle with this feature, and the spell slots you create vanish when you finish a long rest. 2 CLASSES 83 CREATING SPELL SLOTS SPELL SLOT CIRCLE SORCERY POINT COST SPELL SLOT CIRCLE SORCERY POINT COST 1st 2 4th 6 2nd 3 5th 7 3rd 5 SPELLCASTING 1st-Level Sorcerer Feature As a conduit for arcane power, you can cast Arcane spells. See Chapter 7: Spellcasting for general rules of spellcasting and the Arcane spell list. Cantrips At 1st level, choose three cantrips from the Arcane spell list to learn. You choose more Arcane cantrips to learn at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer Progression table. Casting Spells You know a small number of spells and can cast any of them by using an Arcane spell slot of the spell’s circle or higher. You don't need to prepare spells ahead of time. The Sorcerer Progression table shows how many spells you know and how many Arcane spell slots you have at a given level. For example, at 3rd level, you have four 1st-circle slots and two 2nd-circle slots. If you know the 1st-circle spell magic missile and have a 1st-circle and a 2nd-circle spell slot available, you can cast magic missile using either slot. If you use a 1st-circle slot, you have three 1st-circle slots remaining. You regain all used spell slots when you finish a long rest.

Then choose your 1st-circle Arcane spells: shield and magic missile. 84 PLAYER'S GUIDE Spells Known of 1st Circle and Higher At 1st level, choose two 1st-circle spells from the Arcane spell list to learn. The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer Progression table shows when you learn additional Arcane spells. Each spell you choose must be from a circle for which you have Arcane spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level as a sorcerer, you can learn one new Arcane spell of 1st or 2nd circle. In addition, when you gain a level of sorcerer, you can choose one Arcane spell you know and replace it with another spell of your choice from the Arcane spell list. The replacement spell must be of a circle for which you have Arcane spell slots. Spellcasting Ability Charisma (CHA) is your spellcasting ability. Your CHA modifier determines the save DC or the attack modifier for certain spells you cast: Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus (PB) + your CHA modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus (PB) + your CHA modifier Spellcasting Focus You can use an arcane focus (see Adventuring Gear in Chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your Arcane spells. METAMAGIC 2nd, 6th, 13th, and 18th-Level Sorcerer Feature You gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs in the moment. You start with two of the following Metamagic feature options of your choice. You gain another option at 6th, 13th, and 18th levels. You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted. To alter a spell with metamagic, a spell must count as an Arcane spell for you. When your sorcerer level grants you the Improvement feature, you can replace one Metamagic option you know with a different Metamagic option from this list. Careful Spell When you cast a spell that forces creatures to make a save, you can spend 1 sorcery point to exclude some of them from the effect. When you do, choose a number of those creatures up to half your sorcerer level (rounded up). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its save and takes no damage from the spell. You can use the Careful Spell option even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell. Distant Spell When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to increase its range by 100 feet. Spells with a range of touch instead have their range increased to 30 feet. Empowered Spell When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of damage dice up to your CHA modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new roll results. You can use the Empowered Spell option even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell. Enlarged Spell When you cast a spell with a range of self that affects an area (not a specific target), you can spend 3 sorcery points to increase the size of the spell’s area of effect in one of the following ways (depending on the shape of the spell effect): • Circle, Cylinder, or Sphere. The radius of circle, sphere, or circular base of the cylinder increases by 5 feet. For example, the darkness spell could be altered to affect a 20-foot-radius sphere (instead of a 15-foot-radius sphere). • Cone. The cone’s size increases by 15 feet. For example, the burning hands spell could be altered to affect a 30-foot cone (instead of a 15-foot cone). • Cube. The length of each cube face increases by 5 feet. For example, the thunderwave spell could be altered to affect a 20-foot cube (instead of a 15-foot cube). • Line. The length of the line increases by 15 feet. For example, the lightning bolt spell could be altered to affect a 115-foot line (instead of a 100-foot line). Extended Spell When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to increase its duration to 10 minutes. Spells with a duration of 10 minutes or longer instead have their duration doubled, to a maximum duration of 24 hours. Flexible Spell When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to change the spell’s damage type to any other damage type, except psychic. Spells that naturally deal psychic damage can't benefit from the Flexible Spell option. Heightened Spell When you cast a spell that forces a target to make a save to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first save made against the spell. Hunting Spell When you cast a spell that requires a target to make a save or take damage, you can spend 2 sorcery points to cause the spell to deal half damage even if a target succeeds on its save. This damage still affects targets who could normally avoid taking all damage on a successful save (via Evasion or similar features). 2 CLASSES 85 Lucky Spell When you cast a spell that requires an attack roll and miss, you can spend 2 sorcery points to add the total number of Luck that you currently have to the attack roll, potentially turning a failure into a success. Luck isn’t expended by this Metamagic option and can subsequently be spent on the attack roll normally. Quickened Spell When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting. You can’t use this feature to cast two 1st-circle or higher spells on the same turn. Retain Spell When you cast a spell that requires concentration, you can spend 2 sorcery point to have advantage on any concentration checks made to maintain the spell for its duration. Your concentration isn’t automatically broken for that spell if you become incapacitated, meaning that you can still attempt concentration checks as you normally would. You can use the Retain Spell option even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell. Shielding Spell When you cast a spell, you can spend 2 sorcery points to gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 3 × the spell’s circle. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour. Subtle Spell When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components. Twinned Spell When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to 1 + the spell’s circle to target a second creature in range with the same spell. (Cantrips cost only 1 sorcery point.) To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current circle. For example, magic missile and scorching ray aren’t eligible but acid arrow and ray of enfeeblement are. SORCERER SUBCLASS 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th-Level Sorcerer Feature Choose a subclass that reflects the origins of your magical power, either Chaos or Draconic (detailed at the end of this class). Your choice grants you spells and other features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level. Origin Spells Each sorcerer subclass has a list of origin spells that you can access as soon as you can cast spells of that circle (as shown in the Sorcerer Progression table). Once you gain such a spell, it is always on your list of known spells and doesn’t count against the number of spells you know. However, casting an origin spell still expends an Arcane spell slot as normal. If one of these spells isn’t on the Arcane spell list, it still counts as an Arcane spell for you. You can’t replace origin spells when you gain a level of sorcerer. IMPROVEMENT 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th-Level Sorcerer Feature Choose one of the following improvements (ability scores can’t be raised above 20 with this feature): • Increase a single ability score by 2. • Increase two different ability scores by 1 each. • Increase one ability score by 1 and select a talent from the magic talents list (see Magic Talents in Chapter 4). PLAYER ADVICE While the Subtle Spell option of the Metamagic feature seems straightforward on paper, it allows for a wide array of powerful rules interactions. For example, spells cast using the Subtle Spell option can't be the target of the counterspell spell. Creatures have disadvantage on Insight and Perception checks made to determine that you were the source of such a spell. Plus, it allows you to cast without the use of your hands, which means you can cast even if you are bound or while wielding other objects. SORCEROUS RENEWAL 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th-Level Sorcerer Feature When you finish a short rest, roll 1d4 + 1 and regain that many sorcery points. At higher levels, your Sorcerous Renewal feature improves: you roll 2d4 + 1 at 9th level, 3d4 + 1 at 13th, and 4d4 + 1 at 17th. HEROIC BOON 10th-Level Sorcerer Feature Your commitment to the sorcerer’s path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons: • Arcane Instruction. You find new ways to tap into internal magical resources. When you fail an ability check, you can spend 1 sorcery point to add your CHA modifier to the result, potentially turning a failure into a success. 86 PLAYER'S GUIDE • Innate Spell. You learn one spell of 1st or 2nd circle from the Arcane, Primordial, or Wyrd spell list. You can cast that spell at its lowest circle by expending a number of sorcery points equal to that spell’s circle instead of using a spell slot. When you gain a level in sorcerer, you can replace your innate spell with another spell of 1st or 2nd circle from the available lists. DEVOUR SPELL 14th-Level Sorcerer Feature When a creature you can see targets you with a spell, you can use your reaction to attempt to immediately draw the spell’s power into yourself. Make a CHA check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell’s circle. On a success, you and every other target of the spell have advantage on saves against it and take only half as much damage from it. You also gain a number of sorcery points equal to the spell’s circle. Alternatively, you can target a magical effect within 30 feet of you that was created by a spell, such as fog cloud or wall of fire. On a successful CHA check, the spell ends. Once you successfully devour a spell, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 4 sorcery points to do so. EPIC BOON 20th-Level Sorcerer Feature Your commitment to the sorcerer’s path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon: • Arcane Conjunction. When a spell or magical effect affects you, you can use your reaction to target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. That creature is affected as though it were also the target. Once used, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you spend 10 sorcery points to do so. SORCERER SUBCLASSES When you started adventuring, you might have been unaware of the source of your magical abilities. Now, as your power grows, so too does your understanding of your magic’s origins. Alternatively, you may have had a passing knowledge of your sorcerous origin long ago, but as you gain greater mastery of the magic within, you move into its fuller power. CHAOS Be it a blessing or a curse, your innate magic stems from the churning chaos that spawned reality. You may have harnessed this enigmatic power through an ancient ritual, proximity to a cataclysmic event, or maybe you haplessly wandered into a ley line amid a cosmic convergence, wholly unaware. This magic pulses inside you, prepared to spring forth, unbidden, whenever it may. CHAOS PROGRESSION SORCERER LEVEL FEATURES 3rd Chaos Manifestation, Chaos Origin Spells, Volatile Magic 7th Embrace Chaos 11th Inflict Disorder 15th Apotheosis of Discord CHAOS MANIFESTATION 3rd-Level Chaos Feature When you reduce one or more creatures to 0 HP or score a critical hit with a spell attack, the chaos within you manifests in a random way. To determine the effect, roll a d6 and consult the Chaos Manifestation table. Once you trigger a benefit, you can’t trigger another before the start of your next turn. CHAOS ORIGIN SPELLS 3rd-Level Chaos Feature You gain origin spells at the sorcerer levels listed in the Chaos Origin Spells table. See the Sorcerer Subclass class feature for how these spells work. CHAOS MANIFESTATION d6 EFFECT 1 You become invisible until the end of your next turn (see Appendix A: Conditions). This invisibility ends early if you attack or cast a spell. 2 Threads of magic explode out from you, dealing 1d4 + your PB force damage to each creature within 30 feet of you of your choice. 3 You gain a +1 bonus to AC for each hostile creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, up to a number equal to your PB, until the end of your next turn. 4 Until the end of your next turn, you can move through creatures and objects as though they were difficult terrain. If you end your turn inside a creature or object, you take 4d10 force damage and are pushed to the nearest unoccupied space. 5 Until the end of your next turn, magical darkness pours out from you in a 10-foot-radius sphere. The darkness is centered on you and moves with you. You can see normally through this darkness. 6 You teleport to an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you that you can see. You must succeed on a DC 10 CON save or be stunned until the start of your next turn. 2 CLASSES 87 CHAOS ORIGIN SPELLS SORCERER LEVEL SPELLS 3rd misty step, shatter 5th blink, hypnotic pattern 7th compulsion, polymorph 9th seeming, telekinesis 11th eyebite, irresistible dance VOLATILE MAGIC 3rd-Level Chaos Feature The magic that courses through you is unpredictable at best, dangerous at worst. When you cast a spell of 1st circle or higher, you must roll a d20 against your volatile save DC. On a failure, the spell’s effects happen, but the spell becomes volatile, and you must roll on the Volatile Spell Effect table to determine any additional effects the spell has: Volatile save DC = 20 − your sorcerer level + the circle of the spell You can spend Luck, as normal, on the d20 roll to determine whether your magic is volatile. However, if you make a volatile magic roll while you have 0 Luck, roll twice and take the higher result. Any effects created by the volatile spell that require a save use your sorcerer spell save DC. EMBRACE CHAOS 7th-Level Chaos Feature As a bonus action, you can roll on the Volatile Spell Effect table and suffer the effects as though you are the target of any effect or spell. If the result of your roll is an even number, you gain a number of sorcery points equal to your PB. If the result of your roll is an odd number, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your CON score, which last for 1 hour. Once used, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest. INFLICT DISORDER 11th-Level Chaos Feature When a creature targets you with a spell or attack, you can use your reaction to roll on the Volatile Spell Effect table. After you roll, but before the effect takes place, you can spend 1 sorcery point to force the attacking creature to be the target of the effect instead of you. Once used, you can't use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest, unless you spend 2 sorcery points to do so. APOTHEOSIS OF DISCORD 15th-Level Chaos Feature When you cast a spell of 6th circle or higher, you can choose to become a conduit for the magic around you, overwhelming you with Arcane power. This state lasts for 1 minute or until you are knocked unconscious. While affected, you gain the following benefits: • The number of sorcery points required to use each metamagic option you know is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0). • When you cast a spell of 1st circle or higher, you gain resistance to all damage until the end of your next turn. • You can cast any Arcane or origin spell you know without expending a spell slot or needing any components. To do so, the spell must have a casting time of 1 minute or less and be of a spell circle no higher than half your PB (rounded down). Once used, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 15 sorcery points to do so. 88 PLAYER'S GUIDE d100 EFFECT 1–2 Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute. For the duration, the cost of your Metamagic options is reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 0). 3–4 At the end of your next turn, a 3rd-circle fireball spell will detonate centered on you. If you are completely covered by water or dirt, the fireball doesn’t go off. 5–6 A mischievous and judgmental quasit named Gerknoz appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Gerknoz remains for 1 hour or until slain and is controlled by the GM. 7–8 The target of your spell is enlarged as if by the enlarge/reduce spell. If the spell has no target, you are enlarged instead. 9–10 At the end of your turn, wind blasts out from you in all directions (as the gust of wind spell). 11–12 You become as heavy as iron and are knocked prone. Until the end of your next turn, your speed is reduced to 0. A creature grappling, restraining, or carrying you must succeed on a DC 30 STR save or fall prone as well. 13–14 You rise 30 feet into the air and hover there until the end of your next turn, at which point you fall. 15–16 You are cloaked in shadow and reek of brimstone for 1 hour. Light sources within 5 feet of you have the range of their bright and dim light reduced by 20 feet. During this time, you have advantage on DEX (Stealth) checks and CHA (Intimidation) checks but disadvantage on CHA (Persuasion) checks. 17–18 Inky crows appear circling around you for 1 minute. The crows release a shrill caw that gives you and each creature within 20 feet of you disadvantage on concentration checks. 19–20 A falling star hurtles toward the target of your spell. If the spell has no target, the target is you. At the end of your next turn, if the target is within 100 feet of where it was when you cast the spell, they must succeed on a DEX save or take 3d10 bludgeoning damage and 3d10 fire damage from the meteor. 21–22 You and a being from another plane can use a bonus action to see, hear, and speak to one another for 1 minute. The being is neither hostile nor helpful, though that can change at GM’s discretion. 23–24 You and a random creature that can see or hear you take 1 piercing damage as your mouths are stitched shut by arcane thread. Until a creature uses an action to cut the thread, you and the target can speak only in muffled groans and can't supply the verbal components for spellcasting. 25–26 Tar drips from the sky in a 30-foot radius around you. The tar makes the area difficult terrain, and any open flames in the area grow by 1d10 feet toward you at the start of each of your turns. The downfall persists for 1 minute. 27–28 A plush armchair, an end table with a magically burning oil lamp, and one of your favorite books all appear in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you. You regain 2 additional sorcery points if you complete a short rest in such luxury. 29–30 Your hair falls out and takes the vague shape of an animated sword. The sword follows and defends you until it is reduced to 0 HP, at which point the hair scurries off, now free. Your hair regrows normally. 31–32 You gain resistance to all damage for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. 33–34 Until you finish a short or long rest, you can't see or hear Fey, such as sprites. 35–36 You gain truesight to a distance of 100 feet for 1 hour. For the duration, you can’t tell a lie by any means short of divine intervention. 37–38 Your skin glows with pale, colorful light. For 1 hour, you gain a bonus to AC equal to half your sorcerer level, rounded up. 39–40 A portal to a random elemental plane is ripped open in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of your spell’s target. The portal remains for 1 minute. Roll a d4: 1, Plane of Fire; 2, Plane of Air; 3, Plane of Water; 4, Plane of Earth. On initiative count 20 of each round, roll a d20. On a roll of 20, an elemental creature of the GM’s choice emerges from the portal. 41–42 Your skin becomes translucent, showing the muscle and vein beneath. For 1 minute, you gain vulnerability to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. 43–44 Each friendly creature within 30 feet of you can instantly choose to teleport up to 1 mile. The creature must be able to see or be familiar with the location in order to teleport there. 45–46 One creature of your choice on the same plane as you becomes paralyzed until the end of your next turn. Creatures with legendary actions are unaffected. 47–48 You and each hostile creature within 30 feet of you become stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect for all stunned creatures on a success. 49–50 Until you finish a long rest, every word you utter sounds normal to you but is heard by others as incomprehensible babbling. This effect doesn’t impair your ability to cast spells. 51–52 The sun or moon (depending on the time of day) is eclipsed for 10 minutes. For the duration, you are incorporeal and can move through creatures and objects as though they were difficult terrain. If you end your turn inside a creature or object, you take 1d10 force damage and are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space. 53–54 Arcane energy thrums through you, creating an unnatural warble that is audible to a distance of 300 feet. For 1 hour, your cantrips deal additional damage equal to your CHA modifier. 55–56 Until you finish a long rest, your movement speed increases by 15 feet. When you take the Dash action, your jump distance is tripled until the end of your turn. VOLATILE SPELL EFFECT 2 CLASSES 89 57–58 For 1 hour, you leave behind smoldering footprints of hellfire. Ice, snow, or difficult terrain caused by a liquid, such as mud or oil, is burned away and doesn’t affect you for the duration. 59–60 The surface upon which you stand becomes as smooth as polished glass to a distance of 300 feet. Difficult terrain in the area is instantly removed and creatures that move more than half their speed on the surface must succeed on a DEX save or fall prone. 61–62 You and another creature within 30 feet of you regain 3d10 hit points. If no other creature is within 30 feet of you, you instead take necrotic damage equal to half your current hit points. 63–64 Your STR score increases to 19 for 1 hour. If your STR score is 19 or higher already, your STR score instead becomes 10. 65–66 One item you are carrying or wearing ignites in harmless flames, as with the continual flame spell. 67–68 The target of your spell is bathed in a sickening pink light. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and saves until the start of your next turn. 69–70 Treat the next ability check, attack roll, or save that you make before the end of your next turn as though you rolled a 20 on the d20. 71–72 You and each creature within 20 feet of you are instantly dressed in fine clothing worth a total of 100 gp. 73–74 The target of your spell teleports to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. While you remain within 5 feet of the target, you are invisible to it. 75–76 You can immediately cast a cantrip or take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use Object action as part of casting the spell that became volatile. 77–78 You fall asleep until a creature uses its action to shake you awake or you take damage. While asleep, hostile creatures within 20 feet of you take 1d6 psychic damage from your nightmares. 79–80 Each creature within 20 feet of you (other than you) is targeted by the heat metal spell as though you cast it. You lose concentration on any other spell you are currently concentrating on and begin concentrating on heat metal as though you cast it. 81–82 You become a fine pink mist, as with the gaseous form spell, for 1 hour. You can use your action to revert to your true form. 83–84 You take 2d6 piercing damage as bony spikes sprout from your limbs, chest, and head. For 10 minutes, a creature that touches you or hits you with a melee attack takes 2d6 piercing damage. 85–86 Massive insect wings, like those of either a dragonfly or a moth, sprout from your back. You gain a flying speed of 60 feet for 1 hour. 87–88 A nonmagical weapon held by the target of your spell (or the closest creature holding a weapon) becomes a scorpion. The scorpion has 30 temporary hit points, INT 7 (-2), can speak Abyssal, and regards the caster as a trusted friend. 89–90 A number of your teeth (1d4 + 1) fall out. For each tooth that hits the ground, a skeleton appears. Any such skeletons are hostile to everyone except you, and they fight until destroyed. Your teeth regrow when you finish a short or long rest. 91–92 You and the target of your spell (if any) can choose to teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. 93–94 Each hostile creature within 30 feet of you that can see or hear you is frightened of you for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect for itself on a success. 95–96 Any metal weapons, armor, or jewelry you are wearing crackle with lightning and shine bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet for 1 minute. A creature that touches you or hits you with a melee attack takes 1d6 lightning damage. 97–98 For 1 hour, should you die, you instead remain at 1 hit point and appear in the location in which you last took a long rest. 99–100 You regain a number of sorcery points equal to half your PB (rounded up) at the start of each of your turns for the next minute. At the end of each of your turns for the duration, you take force damage equal to the number of sorcery points you have. DRACONIC Through lineage, bargain, or unrequited gift, the origins of your magic lie in the preternatural power of dragons. These beings, monumental in their age, power, and size, possess unshakeable bearing, unstoppable might, and mastery over the elements of the natural world. DRACONIC PROGRESSION SORCERER LEVEL FEATURES 3rd Draconic Origin Spells, Draconic Resilience, Dragon Ancestor 7th Elemental Affinity 11th Imperious Wings 15th Draconian Vengeance 90 PLAYER'S GUIDE DRACONIC ORIGIN SPELLS 3rd-Level Draconic Feature You gain origin spells at the sorcerer levels listed in the Dragon Ancestor Damage Type and Spells table. See the Sorcerer Subclass class feature for how these spells work. Note that one of the spells you gain at each listed sorcerer level is determined by the type of dragon you select as your ancestor (see Dragon Ancestor). DRACONIC ORIGIN SPELLS SORCERER LEVEL SPELLS 3rd command, dragon ancestor spell 5th elemental blade, dragon ancestor spell 7th fear, dragon ancestor spell 9th elemental shield, dragon ancestor spell 11th dominate, dragon ancestor spell DRACONIC RESILIENCE 3rd-Level Draconic Feature As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. Your hit point maximum increases immediately by 1 and by an additional 1 when you gain a level of sorcerer. In addition, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your DEX modifier. DRAGON ANCESTOR 3rd-Level Draconic Feature You begin to manifest traits of the type of dragon that instilled you with power. Choose that dragon’s type now. This choice also dictates some of your spells gained with your Draconic Origin Spells feature, and the damage type associated with each dragon is used by additional features you gain later. DRAGON ANCESTOR DAMAGE TYPE AND SPELLS DRAGON TYPE DAMAGE TYPE 3RD LEVEL 5TH LEVEL 7TH LEVEL 9TH LEVEL 11TH LEVEL Black or Copper Acid grease acid arrow stinking cloud stone shape cloudkill Blue or Bronze Lightning thunderwave invisibility lightning bolt greater invisibility conjure elemental (air) Brass, Gold, or Red Fire burning hands heat metal fireball wall of fire flame strike Green Poison entangle barkskin stinking cloud blight contagion Silver or White Cold fog cloud hold sleet storm ice storm cone of cold Void Necrotic inflict wounds ray of enfeeblement vampiric touch blight antilife shell Yellow Radiant guiding bolt moonbeam daylight mass faerie fire flame strike You can now speak, read, and write Draconic. In addition, when you make an ability check when interacting with or recalling information about dragons, treat any d20 roll less than your sorcerer level as if you rolled a number equal to your sorcerer level. ELEMENTAL AFFINITY 7th-Level Draconic Feature When you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry (including spells with a damage type modified by features such as your Flexible Spell metamagic option), you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain one of the following benefits: • Each target takes additional damage equal to your PB. • You gain resistance to that damage type for 1 minute. IMPERIOUS WINGS 11th-Level Draconic Feature You gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a fly speed equal to your walking speed. You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn, and they last until you dismiss them (also as a bonus action on your turn). While the wings are manifested, creatures that can see you have disadvantage on checks and saves to avoid being frightened or intimidated by you. You can’t manifest your wings while wearing armor. DRACONIAN VENGEANCE 15th-Level Draconic Feature As an action, you can target one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see to brand it with your draconic element. The target must succeed on a CHA save against your spell save DC or become vulnerable to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry until the end of your next turn. A target resistant to that damage type loses that resistance for the duration, but a target immune to the damage type is still immune to it, even if the target fails the save. Once used, you can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 4 sorcery points to do so. 2 CLASSES 91 WARLOCK Warlocks are ruled by their connection to the supernatural forces that lurk beyond the veil of reality. In exchange for secret knowledge and eldritch power, warlocks make pacts with mysterious entities who dwell in distant realms. The motivations of such beings are often shrouded, but many consent to sell their power to those that hunger for it— until they call in their marker. Warlock is a class that does a handful of things very well. Your class features make you the very best at the things you decide to be best at, and chief among them is ranged combat. For the inevitable gaps that occur, rely on other characters to fill in. WARLOCKS AS ADVENTURERS Warlocks are exceptional combatants who back up damage-dealing capabilities with an array of spells and invocations. They have many available options, which means they can tailor their powers to become explorers or socializers. Either way, their raw blasting power shines on the battlefield. Few understand the relationship between warlocks and their patrons, which often leads to distrust and misunderstandings. This can make adventuring life more attractive than remaining in one place. Travel also allows warlocks to uncover hidden knowledge to increase their own power or that of the patrons they serve.

HIT POINTS Hit Dice: 1d8 per warlock level Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your CON modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your CON modifier per warlock level after 1st PROFICIENCIES Armor: Light armor, medium armor, shields Weapons: Simple weapons Tools: None Saves: WIS, CHA Skills: Choose two from Arcana, Deception, History, Intimidation, Investigation, Nature, and Religion STARTING EQUIPMENT You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: • (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any simple weapon • (a) a component pouch or (b) a wyrd focus • (a) a scholar’s pack or (b) a dungeoneer’s pack • Leather armor, any simple weapon, and two daggers ELDRITCH BLAST 1st, 5th, 9th, and 14th-Level Warlock Feature As a result of binding yourself to otherworldly powers, you can conjure a baleful magical energy. As an action, you can send a beam of crackling eldritch power toward a creature within 120 feet of you. When you do so, make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage. Upon achieving higher levels of warlock, you can create more than one beam: two beams at 5th level, three at 9th, and four at 14th. You can direct the beams at the same or different target. You make a separate attack roll for each beam. PACT BOON 1st-Level Warlock Feature The initial pact that grants you your warlock powers is sealed with the gift of a Pact Boon. You gain one of the following boons of your choice. Pact of the Blade You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You have proficiency with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. When you attack with the weapon, you can use your CHA modifier, instead of STR or DEX, for attack and damage rolls. Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die. You can transform an existing weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short or long rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears when you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks. PLAYER ADVICE Though the Eldritch Blast class feature uses a ranged spell attack, it is not truly a spell. That means it can’t be affected by the counterspell spell, altered by features like Metamagic, or affected by any other features that specifically interact with spells. Pact of the Chain You learn a more potent version of the find familiar ritual and can cast it without the need for any material components. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known. A familiar summoned with this feature has the following differences from a standard familiar summoned by the spell: • When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal familiar forms or one of the following special forms: blink dog, imp, pseudodragon, or quasit. • You can telepathically communicate or see through your familiar’s eyes as long as it is on the same plane as you, ignoring the standard 100-foot range restriction. In addition, while perceiving through your familiar’s senses, you can also speak through your familiar in your own voice, even if your familiar is normally incapable of speech. • Your familiar can attack. In combat, your familiar shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger. 2 CLASSES 93 Pact of the Tome You receive an eldritch grimoire called a Book of Shadows. You can use your Book of Shadows as a spellcasting focus for your spells. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any source spell list (they don’t have to be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips. These cantrips count as Wyrd spells for you. If your Book of Shadows is lost or destroyed, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to create a replacement. The replacement contains any spells previously transcribed within it. This ceremony can be performed as part of a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous grimoire— if it still exists. The book is unreadable by anyone but you, and it is instantly destroyed when you die. ELDRITCH INVOCATIONS 2nd-Level Warlock Feature In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations. These fragments of forbidden knowledge imbue you with magical abilities that abide beyond any mere spell duration You gain two eldritch invocations of your choice, though you must meet any prerequisites. Invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description. At certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock Progression table. In addition, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one invocation you know and replace it with another invocation that you meet the prerequisites for. SPELLCASTING 2nd-Level Warlock Feature Your eldritch power deepens, giving you the ability to cast Wyrd spells. See Chapter 7: Spellcasting for general rules of spellcasting and the Wyrd spell list. Cantrips At 2nd level, choose two cantrips from the Wyrd spell list to learn. You choose more Wyrd cantrips to learn at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock Progression table. Casting Spells You know a small number of spells and can cast any of them by using a Wyrd spell slot of the spell’s circle or higher. You don't need to prepare spells ahead of time. The Warlock Progression table shows how many spells you know and how many spell slots you have per day at a given level. For example, at 5th level, you have four 1stcircle slots and two 2nd-circle slots. If you know the 1stcircle spell bane and have a 1st-circle and a 2nd-circle spell slot available, you can cast bane using either slot. If you use a 1st-circle slot, you have three 1st-circle slots remaining. You regain all used spell slots when you finish a long rest. Spells Known of 1st-Circle and Higher At 2nd level, choose two 1st-circle spells from the Wyrd spell list to learn. The Spells Known column of the Warlock Progression table shows when you learn additional Wyrd spells. Each spell you choose must be from a circle for which you have Wyrd spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level as a warlock, you can learn one new Wyrd spell of 1st or 2nd circle. In addition, when you gain a level of warlock, you can choose one Wyrd spell you know and replace it with another spell of your choice from the Wyrd spell list. The replacement spell must be of a circle for which you have Wyrd spell slots. Spellcasting Ability Charisma (CHA) is your spellcasting ability. Your CHA modifier determines the save DC or the attack modifier for certain spells you cast: Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus (PB) + your CHA modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus (PB) + your CHA modifier Spellcasting Focus You can use a wyrd focus (see Adventuring Gear in Chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your Wyrd spells. WARLOCK SUBCLASS 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th-Level Warlock Feature Choose a subclass that reflects the type of entity that becomes your patron, either Fiend or Reaper (detailed at the end of this class). Your choice grants you spells and other features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level. Pact Spells Each warlock subclass has a list of pact spells that you can access as soon as you can cast spells of that circle (as shown in the Warlock Progression table). Once you gain such a spell, it is always on your list of known spells and doesn’t count against the number of spells you know. However, casting a pact spell still expends a Wyrd spell slot as normal. WARLOCK QUICK BUILD To quickly create a warlock, follow these steps during character creation: • For ability scores, prioritize CHA and then CON. • For lineage and heritage, choose any combination you like. • For background and talent, choose Outcast and Opportunist. • Choose Pact of the Blade for your Pact Boon feature. 94 PLAYER'S GUIDE If one of these spells isn’t on the Wyrd spell list, it still counts as a Wyrd spell for you. You can’t replace pact spells when you gain a level of warlock. Pact Magic Your patron gives you access to a special reservoir of power called Pact Magic. You can expend one use of Pact Magic to cast any Pact Spell you know without expending a spell slot, though they are always treated as cast at the highest‑circle warlock spell slot you can access (see Warlock Progression). You can use this feature twice, whether casting the same or different spells from your Pact Spells. You gain additional uses of Pact Magic at higher warlock levels: at 13th level, you can use it three times between rests, and at 17th level, you can use it four times between rests. You regain all expended uses of Pact Magic when you finish a short or long rest. IMPROVEMENT 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 18th-Level Warlock Feature Choose one of the following improvements (ability scores can’t be raised above 20 with this feature): • Increase a single ability score by 2. • Increase two different ability scores by 1 each. • Increase one ability score by 1 and select a talent from the magic talents list (see Magic Talents in Chapter 4). ENHANCED BOON 6th-Level Warlock Feature Your patron enhances your Pact Boon as a reward for your service. You gain one of the following enhancements as determined by your chosen Pact Boon. If you have more than one Pact Boon, choose which one is enhanced. Pact of the Blade. You can attack with your pact weapon twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn. Pact of the Chain. When you complete a short or long rest, your familiar gains temporary hit points equal to your PB + your CHA modifier. In addition, when you make an attack against a creature within 5 feet of your familiar, your familiar can use its reaction to give you advantage on the attack roll. Pact of the Tome. You can now inscribe rituals into your Book of Shadows. Choose two rituals of 1st or 2nd circle (in any combination) from the Wyrd ritual list. The rituals appear in the book and don’t count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen rituals. On your adventures, you can add other Wyrd rituals you find to your Book of Shadows if a ritual’s circle is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each circle of the ritual, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it. HEROIC BOON 10th-Level Warlock Feature Your commitment to the warlock’s path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons: • Echoes of Knowledge. You learn one 1st-circle and one 2nd-circle spell of your choice from any spell list, they count as Wyrd spells for you. The chosen spells can’t be rituals, and they don’t count against your total spells known. These spells are added to your list of Pact Spells and can be cast by expending a use of Pact Magic or by expending Wyrd spell slots as normal. • Echoes of Power. When you successfully hit with one of your Eldritch Blast beams and roll a 10 on the damage die, you can roll the d10 again and add the result as extra force damage dealt by that beam. PATRON’S FAVOR 18th-Level Warlock Feature You can call upon your patron’s power by expending a use of your Pact Magic feature to cast any spell you know of 5th-circle or lower from any spell list. EPIC BOON 20th-Level Warlock Feature Your commitment to the warlock’s path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon: • Eldritch Master. If you start your turn with no uses of Pact Magic remaining, you can beseech your patron to immediately restore all expended uses (no action required). You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again. PACTS AND PATRONS A crucial aspect of creating a warlock is choosing what kind of beings you forge pacts with. When you create your warlock, your power is likely drawn from pacts with lesser or unnamed entities. As your power grows, your alliance shifts to a greater being called a patron. For example, at 1st level you might receive your pact powers from alliances with lesser devils. Your success with these eventually draws the attention of a fiendish patron at 3rd level. Alternatively, your initial pacts could be forged with a creature whose nature is unknown to you, but it reveals itself as a true patron when your strengths manifest. 2 CLASSES 95 ELDRITCH INVOCATIONS This section lists the eldritch invocations available for warlocks to learn. If an invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. If a prerequisite lists a level requirement, that is the minimum warlock level required (you can take it at higher warlock levels). AGONIZING BLAST Prerequisite: None When you use your Eldritch Blast feature, add your CHA modifier to the damage each beam deals on a successful hit.

As long as the creature is on the same plane as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature’s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings. LIFEDRINKER Prerequisite: 11th Level When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes additional necrotic damage equal to your CHA modifier (minimum of 1).

MYSTIC ARCANUM Prerequisite: 11th Level Your patron bestows a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one non-ritual spell from the Wyrd spell list as this arcanum. The highest circle spell you can choose is determined by your current warlock level, as shown in the Maximum Circle by Level table. You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again. Alternatively, if your arcanum is of a circle for which you have spell slots, you can expend a spell slot to cast it as you would a standard spell. You can take this invocation multiple times, choosing a different spell each time. MAXIMUM CIRCLE BY LEVEL WARLOCK LEVEL MAXIMUM SPELL CIRCLE OF ARCANUM 11th 6th Circle 13th 7th Circle 15th 8th Circle 17th 9th Circle ONE WITH SHADOWS Prerequisite: 5th Level When you are in an area of dim light, darkness, or magical darkness, you can use your action to become invisible (see Appendix A: Conditions) until you move or take an action or a reaction.

REPELLING BLAST Prerequisite: None When you successfully hit a creature with one or more beams created by your Eldritch Blast feature, you can push the creature up to 10 feet per beam away from you in a straight line (in addition to dealing damage). If this movement is interrupted by the target encountering a solid surface (such as being pushed into a stone wall), the target also takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each 10-foot increment it moved. SCULPTOR OF FLESH Prerequisite: 7th Level You can cast the polymorph spell without expending a spell slot or material components. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

When you choose (or are chosen by) a patron, all eldritch pacts previously made with lesser creatures pass into the patron’s possession. Patrons are distant beings who often display little care for the mundanities of mortal affairs. Patrons may impart knowledge of their desires to their warlocks, but far more often, their motivations are shrouded in mystery. Regardless of day-to-day involvement, your patron will someday require your services at a time and in the manner of their choosing. You will be in no position to decline. FIEND Your patron is a greater fiend who holds dominion over lesser demons or devils. Fiendish patrons are uncontestably bound to the forces of evil—though the warlocks they choose rarely are. These patrons often delight in granting power to mortals, even if those mortals openly strive against their destructive aims. Whether these tendencies are exercises in corruption or serve a more nefarious design, few can say. FIEND PROGRESSION WARLOCK LEVEL FEATURES 3rd Dark One’s Blessing, Fiend Pact Spells 7th Dark One’s Own Luck 11th Fiendish Resilience 15th Hurl Through Hell DARK ONE’S BLESSING 3rd-Level Fiend Feature When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 HP or when a hostile creature within 30 feet of you is reduced to 0 HP, you gain temporary hit points equal to your PB + your warlock level. These hit points last until expended or until you complete a long rest. FIEND PACT SPELLS 3rd-Level Fiend Feature You gain pact spells at the warlock levels listed in the Fiend Pact Spells table. See the Warlock Subclass class feature for how these spells work. FIEND PACT SPELLS WARLOCK LEVEL SPELLS 3rd burning hands, command 5th scorching ray, suggestion 9th fireball, stinking cloud 13th blight, wall of fire 17th dominate, flame strike DARK ONE’S OWN LUCK 7th-Level Fiend Feature You can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a save, you can use this feature to add 1d10 to your roll. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. PLAYER ADVICE Multiple sources of temporary hit points can’t stack! If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you must decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. FIENDISH RESILIENCE 11th-Level Fiend Feature You can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. 98 PLAYER'S GUIDE HURL THROUGH HELL 15th-Level Fiend Feature When you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target, causing it to disappear and hurtle through a nightmare landscape. At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied or to the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a Fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. REAPER Your patron is a formless entity given life by an endless hunger for death. These patrons are sometimes called spirits, but their power is far beyond that of the mere undead. Whether born from the collective consciousness of a slaughtered army, a legendary warrior murdered by treachery, or a sentience bound within a cursed blade— Reaper patrons desire glorious bloodshed above all else and seek warlocks capable of feeding their hunger. REAPER PROGRESSION WARLOCK LEVEL FEATURES 3rd Expanded Talent List, Reaper Pact Spells, Reaper’s Mantle 7th Eldritch Warrior 11th Shield of Souls 15th Swift Wings EXPANDED TALENT LIST 3rd-Level Reaper Feature When you gain a new talent, you can select that talent from the magic or martial talent list (see Talents in Chapter 4). REAPER PACT SPELLS 3rd-Level Reaper Feature You gain pact spells at the warlock levels listed in the Reaper Spells table. See the Warlock Subclass class feature for how these spells work. REAPER PACT SPELLS WARLOCK LEVEL SPELLS 3rd false life, shield 5th branding smite, spiritual weapon 9th haste, vampiric touch 13th death ward, phantasmal killer 17th antilife shell, cloudkill REAPER’S MANTLE 3rd-Level Reaper Feature You can wrap yourself in a mantle of eldritch power that weakens nearby foes. As a bonus action, you can activate this mantle for 1 minute. It ends early if you die or become incapacitated. While active, you gain the following benefits: • If a hostile creature within 5 feet of you dies, you regain hit points equal to your PB. • When you deal damage to a creature within 5 feet of you, that creature takes additional necrotic damage equal to your PB. • When you make an attack roll against a creature within 5 feet of you, the attack is considered a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest. ELDRITCH WARRIOR 7th-Level Reaper Feature When you take an action to use your Eldritch Blast feature, you can also make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of you as part of that same action. SHIELD OF SOULS 11th-Level Reaper Feature When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 HP while your reaper’s mantle is active, you can use your reaction to absorb part of the slain creature’s spirit. When you do so, you gain a +1 to AC. This bonus is cumulative, increasing to a maximum bonus equal to your CHA modifier (minimum of +1). This bonus lasts for the duration of your reaper’s mantle or until you take any amount of damage. SWIFT WINGS 15th-Level Reaper Feature As an action, you can make a single melee weapon attack against each creature of your choice within 5 feet of you. On a successful hit, a creature takes additional necrotic damage equal to your CHA modifier (minimum of 1). If none of your targets are reduced to 0 HP by these attacks, you gain one level of exhaustion. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest. 2 CLASSES 99 WIZARD The study of magic is infinitely complex, and every wizard develops a different approach to studying its intricacies. Regardless of the specific aspects you study, your class options reflect an ongoing dedication to mastering magic through research and experimentation. Wizard is a spellcasting class that revels in a breadth of options. Your class features make you the expert on magic, and thinking ahead lets you do your best work. You’re likely to have a spell for any occasion if you have time to prepare for it. WIZARDS AS ADVENTURERS Wizards are academics at heart, and their cerebral pursuits are typically ill-suited to the rigors of an adventuring life. Despite the troubles they might face when confronted by an armed minion or a sheer cliff face, many take up adventuring because it is the best way to acquire hidden knowledge and magical treasures to further their research. While wizards rely on other party members for physical protection, every adventuring party benefits from having a wizard’s knowledge and versatility in their corner. Whether staring down an enchanted foe, blocked by a mystic barrier, or ensorcelled by a possessed artifact, a well-prepared wizard is likely to have a magic solution (or five) in the pages of their spellbook. CLASS FEATURES As a wizard, you have the following class features. HIT POINTS Hit Dice: 1d6 per wizard level Hit Points at 1st Level: 6 + your CON modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d6 (or 4) + your CON modifier per wizard level after 1st WIZARD PROGRESSION ARCANE SPELL SLOTS BY CIRCLE LEVEL PB FEATURES CANTRIPS KNOWN RITUALS KNOWN 1ST 2ND 3RD 4TH 5TH 6TH 7TH 8TH 9TH 1st +2 Arcane Recovery, Spellcasting 3 1 2 — — — — — — — — 2nd +2 Magic Sense 3 1 3 — — — — — — — — 3rd +2 Wizard Subclass 3 2 4 2 — — — — — — — 4th +2 Improvement 4 2 4 3 — — — — — — — 5th +3 Rote Spell (1st-Circle) 4 3 4 3 2 — — — — — — 6th +3 Superior Recovery 4 3 4 3 3 — — — — — — 7th +3 Subclass Feature 4 4 4 3 3 1 — — — — — 8th +3 Improvement 4 4 4 3 3 2 — — — — — 9th +4 Rote Spell (2nd-Circle) 4 5 4 3 3 3 1 — — — — 10th +4 Heroic Boon 5 5 4 3 3 3 2 — — — — 11th +4 Subclass Feature 5 6 4 3 3 3 2 1 — — — 12th +4 Improvement 5 6 4 3 3 3 2 1 — — — 13th +5 Rote Spell (3rd-Circle) 5 7 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 — — 14th +5 Spellguard 5 7 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 — — 15th +5 Subclass Feature 5 8 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 — 16th +5 Improvement 5 8 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 — 17th +6 Rote Spell (4th-Circle) 5 9 4 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 18th +6 Spell Mastery 5 9 4 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 19th +6 Improvement 5 9 4 3 3 3 3 2 1 1 1 20th +6 Epic Boon 5 9 4 3 3 3 3 2 2 1 1 100 PLAYER'S GUIDE SPELLCASTING 1st-Level Wizard Feature As a student of Arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See Chapter 7: Spellcasting for general rules of spellcasting and the Arcane spell list. Cantrips At 1st level, choose three cantrips from the Arcane spell list to learn. You choose more Arcane cantrips to learn at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard Progression table. Spellbook At 1st level, your spellbook contains six 1st-circle Arcane spells of your choice. It is the repository of all the Arcane spells you know—except for your cantrips, which are so simple and well-rehearsed that you don’t even need to write them down. Preparing Spells You must prepare spells in advance before you can cast them. You can prepare any spell in your spellbook for which you have Arcane spell slots. (You determine which spell slots you can access by checking your level on the Wizard Progression table.) You can choose a number of spells equal to your INT modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). This is your list of prepared spells from which you can cast. Preparing a new list of spells requires time studying your spellbook and re-memorizing incantations and gestures: at least 1 minute per spell circle for each spell you change. You can change your list of prepared spells as part of a long rest. Casting Spells You have prepared a number of spells and can cast any of them by using an Arcane spell slot of the spell’s circle or higher. The Wizard Progression table shows how many Arcane spell slots you have at a given level. For example, at 3rd level, you have four 1st-circle and two 2nd-circle spell slots, and with a 16 INT, you can have six prepared spells of 1st or 2nd circle, in any combination. You only have two spell slots for 2nd-circle spells though, so if you prepare only 2nd-circle spells, you won’t be able to use your 1st-circle spell slots at all. Casting a spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells, it just uses up a spell slot. You regain all used spell slots when you finish a long rest. Learning Spells of 1st Circle and Higher Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two Arcane spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each spell must be of a circle for which you have Arcane spell slots, as shown on the Wizard Progression table. During your adventures, you might also find other Arcane spells to add to your spellbook (see the Your Spellbook sidebar). PROFICIENCIES Armor: None Weapons: Simple weapons Tools: None Saves: INT, WIS Skills: Choose two from Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion STARTING EQUIPMENT You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: • (a) a quarterstaff or (b) a dagger • (a) a component pouch or (b) an arcane focus • (a) a scholar’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack • A spellbook ARCANE RECOVERY 1st-Level Wizard Feature You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day, when you finish a short rest, you can recover expended Arcane spell slots of your choice. Recovered spell slots can have a combined circle total equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up). For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two circles’ worth of spell slots. So you could choose to recover either a single 2nd-circle spell slot or two 1stcircle spell slots. WIZARD QUICK BUILD To quickly create a wizard, follow these steps during character creation: • For ability scores, prioritize INT and then either DEX or CON. • For lineage and heritage, choose any combination you like. • For background and talent, choose Soldier and Combat Casting (if you plan to take Battle Mage subclass) or otherwise Scholar and School Specialization. • For spells, choose the light, mage hand, and ray of frost cantrips. Your spellbook contains the following 1st-circle Arcane spells: burning hands, charm, feather fall, mage armor, magic missile, and sleep. Prepare a number of them equal to your INT modifier + 1. Then choose your 1st-circle ritual: identify. 2 CLASSES 101 Spellcasting Ability Intelligence (INT) is your spellcasting ability. Your INT modifier determines the save DC or the attack modifier for certain spells you cast: Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus (PB) + your INT modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus (PB) + your INT modifier Rituals You can also cast a type of long-form spell called a ritual. Rituals don’t need to be prepared, and they don’t use up spell slots. At 1st level, choose one ritual from the Arcane ritual list (see Arcane Ritual List in Chapter 7). You learn more rituals at higher levels, as shown in the Rituals Known column of the Wizard Progression table, but only from a circle for which you have spell slots. Rituals you learn don't count against the number of spells you learn at each level. Rituals are contained in your spellbook alongside your regular spells, and new rituals written on spell scrolls can be copied into your spellbook like normal Arcane spells. Spellcasting Focus You can use an arcane focus (see Adventuring Gear in Chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your Arcane spells. MAGIC SENSE 2nd-Level Wizard Feature You learn to perceive magical workings. As an action, you can open your awareness to detect magical forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of creatures with spellcasting ability, ongoing spell effects, or magic items within 30 feet of you. If the magical effect is the result of an ongoing spell, you learn which school of magic the spell belongs to. This sense can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your PB + 1. When you finish a long rest, you regain all uses. WIZARD SUBCLASS 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th-Level Wizard Feature Choose a subclass that reflects your specialized field of magical study, either Battle Mage or Cantrip Adept (detailed at the end of this class). Your choice grants you features at 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th level. IMPROVEMENT 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th-Level Wizard Feature Choose one of the following improvements (ability scores can’t be raised above 20 with this feature): • Increase a single ability score by 2. • Increase two different ability scores by 1 each. • Increase one ability score by 1 and select a talent from the magic talents list (see Magic Talents in Chapter 4). ROTE SPELL 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th-Level Wizard Feature Your continued practice of spellcraft has honed your mind, allowing you to affix a limited number of spells—called rote spells—in your mind. Choose one 1st-circle Arcane YOUR SPELLBOOK The spells you automatically add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the spell research you conduct on your own. However, you might find other spells during your adventures as well. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in a dungeon chest or in a dusty tome in an ancient library. Copying a Spell into the Book. When you find an Arcane spell of 1st circle or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell circle you can prepare and if you can make time to decipher and copy it. For each circle of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components expended as you experiment with the spell to master it as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other Arcane spells. Replacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook but faster and easier since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each circle of the copied spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place. The Book’s Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume, a finely bound gilt-edge tome, or even a loose collection of notes bound together after you lost your previous spellbook in a magical mishap. 102 PLAYER'S GUIDE spell from your spellbook, and that spell is now a rote spell. You always have a rote spell prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare during a long rest. Casting a rote spell still uses a spell slot as normal. Over the course of 8 hours or as part of a long rest, you can exchange one rote spell for a different Arcane spell of the same circle contained in your spellbook. At higher levels, you can select more rote spells: you choose a 2nd-circle Arcane spell to become a rote spell at 9th level, a 3rd-circle Arcane spell at 13th, and a 4th-circle Arcane spell at 17th. SUPERIOR RECOVERY 6th-Level Wizard Feature When you use your Arcane Recovery feature, you can choose to swap out a number of prepared Arcane spells with different Arcane spells from your spellbook—in addition to recovering Arcane spell slots. You can swap out a number of prepared spells equal to half your PB (rounded down) in this way. SPELLGUARD 14th-Level Wizard Feature Your knowledge of magic allows you to better assess the intentions and power of hostile spells and spell attacks, increasing your chance to avoid their effects. You have advantage on saves against spells and resistance to damage dealt by spells and spell attacks. SPELL MASTERY 18th-Level Wizard Feature You can cast each of your rote spells at their lowest circle once without expending a spell slot. Once you cast a rote spell, you can’t cast that same spell in this way again until you finish a short or long rest. If you want to cast any of your rote spells at a higher circle, you must expend an Arcane spell slot as normal. EPIC BOON 20th-Level Wizard Feature Your commitment to the wizard’s path grants you a powerful new ability. You gain the following epic boon: • Archmage. When you cast a spell of 1st circle or higher and that spell expends an Arcane spell slot, you can choose to roll a d10. If the number rolled is higher than the circle of the expended spell slot, you automatically recover that slot. For example, if you expend a 1stcircle spell slot, a result of 2 or higher on the d10 means that you recover that 1st-circle spell slot. Once you successfully recover a spell slot in this way, you can’t use this feature again until you complete a short rest. WIZARD SUBCLASSES As long as there has been magic, there have been creatures determined to experiment with it, quantify it, and define it. Most of them are wizards. Centuries of magical study have led to various arcane traditions that encompass different methods of thinking about—and practicing—spellcasting. The subclass you choose represents the lens through which you focus your ongoing study of magic. BATTLE MAGE Wizards who follow the Battle Mage tradition aren't interested in theoretical musings or tedious experiments. Instead, they pursue new ways to enhance their power so that they can destroy their foes (and defend their allies) with ever-greater efficiency. BATTLE MAGE PROGRESSION WIZARD LEVEL FEATURES 3rd Expanded Talent List, Spell Ward, Tactical Caster 7th Contingency Plan 11th Blasting Power 15th Counterstrike PLAYER ADVICE The ability to find spells in the world and copy them into your spellbook is a unique element of the wizard base class. Keep your eye out for spellbooks and spell scrolls during your adventures. If it’s been a while since your character found—or had an opportunity to purchase—such treasures, ask your GM about creating more opportunities to expand your repertoire. HEROIC BOON 10th-Level Wizard Feature Your commitment to the wizard’s path grants you a powerful new ability. Choose one of the following heroic boons: • Rite of the Ritualist. When you learn a new ritual as part of gaining a level of wizard, you can choose it from any source of magic. In addition, you can now copy ritual spells from any source of magic into your spellbook. Any rituals gained in this way count as Arcane spells for you. • Rite of the Source Master. Choose the Divine, Primordial, or Wyrd source of magic. When you add new spells to your spellbook as part of gaining a level of wizard (including the level you gain this feature), you can choose spells from the Arcane spell list or spells from your chosen source. Each spell must be a of a circle for which you have spell slots. In addition, you can now copy spells of your chosen source into your spellbook. Any spells gained in this way count as Arcane spells for you. 2 CLASSES 103 EXPANDED TALENT LIST 3rd-Level Battle Mage Feature When your gain a new talent, you can select it from either the magic or the martial talents list (see Talents in Chapter 4). SPELL WARD 3rd-Level Battle Mage Feature You can redirect a portion of your spellcasting energy into a defensive shield. When you cast an Arcane spell of 1st circle or higher, you can simultaneously weave a protective ward around yourself. While the ward is active, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing medium or heavy armor: • You gain a bonus to your armor class (AC) equal to your PB. • You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. The ward lasts for 1 minute, but ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t cast an Arcane spell of 1st circle or higher since your last turn. You can also choose to dismiss your ward at any time (no action required by you). You can use this feature a number of times equal to your PB, and you regain all uses of it when you finish a long rest. TACTICAL CASTER 3rd-Level Battle Mage Feature When you cast an Arcane spell that causes damage, you can choose yourself and any number of allies you can see to be immune to the damage caused by the spell. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your PB, and you regain all uses of it when you finish a long rest. CONTINGENCY PLAN 7th-Level Battle Mage Feature When you fail to hit a creature with a spell attack, you can use your reaction to redirect the spell toward a different target within the spell’s range. You must make a new spell attack roll for the new target. If you miss the new target, you can’t redirect again with the same spell attack. BLASTING POWER 11th-Level Battle Mage Feature When you deal damage with an Arcane spell, you can reroll any 1s you roll on any number of the damage dice. You must take the new result for any dice rerolled in this way (even if the new result is also a 1). COUNTERSTRIKE 15th-Level Battle Mage Feature When a creature succeeds on a save against an Arcane spell you cast and would take no damage or otherwise suffer any effects, they instead take force damage equal to a number of d6 dice equal to the spell’s circle + your INT modifier. CANTRIP ADEPT It’s easy to dismiss the cantrip as an unsophisticated afterthought plied by hedge wizards. But clever, cautious wizards sometimes specialize in these humble magics. While other mages must weigh the use of their magical resources, Cantrip Adepts hardly even notice. At their command, cantrips aren’t so humble. CANTRIP ADEPT PROGRESSION WIZARD LEVEL FEATURES 3rd Arcane Alacrity, Cantrip Polymath 7th Versatile Cantrips 11th Potent Cantrip 15th Empowered Cantrips ARCANE ALACRITY 3rd-Level Cantrip Adept Feature When you cast an Arcane cantrip that has a casting time of 1 action, you can change the casting time to a bonus action for that casting.

CANTRIP POLYMATH 3rd-Level Cantrip Adept Feature You learn two cantrips of your choice from the spell list of any magic source. For you, these cantrips count as Arcane cantrips and don’t count against the number of cantrips you know. In addition, any cantrip you learn or can cast from any source, such as from a lineage or talent, counts as an Arcane cantrip for you. VERSATILE CANTRIPS 7th-Level Cantrip Adept Feature When you finish a short or long rest, you can replace one Arcane cantrip that you know with another cantrip from your list of available Arcane cantrips (including cantrips learned via the Cantrip Polymath feature).
