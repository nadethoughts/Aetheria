## **Session 01 Summary**

- The party enters New Penmaris, a city rebuilt on the ruins of Old Penmaris after the Flaming Retribution.
- Tidewatch Ward, closest to the open sea, was devastated by a magical storm and monster attack ([[Saltspawn]]). It is now sealed off by a wall and magical wards.
- The city is overcrowded with refugees and desperately needs to reclaim [[Tidewatch Ward]].
- The [[Iron Tide Regiment]] (city guard/military) has run out of soldiers and is sending adventurers to investigate and reclaim the ward.
- Each PC has a personal reason for entering the ward:
    - **Arthur & Skirk:** Tasked by the council to find and destroy a demon rumored to be in the ward.
    - **Mistral:** Treasure maps point to valuables in the ward.
    - **Lil John:** Seeks Coralite, a new magical substance from the ward, for monster hunting and city defense.
    - **Xander:** His fishing buddy disappeared near the ward; he suspects the friend was taken inside.
- The party is outfitted with healing potions, tracking runes, and a sending stone for communication.
- They meet **Frederick Wainshore**, the gatekeeper, who warns them of monsters, undead, and the dangers within.
- Upon entering, they fight bone crabs (undead crabs with humanoid skulls) and a mutated tentacle frog.
- The party finds the **Salty Dog Tavern** and discovers graffiti referencing the **Tidecutters** pirate crew and their leader, **Captain Garrick Tidebreaker**. The graffiti also mentions a mysterious pearl.
- The Salty Dog is defensible and could serve as a base of operations.
- The party investigates the area, finds remnants of previous expeditions, and notes the presence of tents and supplies not as old as the rest of the ruins.
- The session ends with the party taking a short rest and preparing to explore further.
