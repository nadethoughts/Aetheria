# Recap
After braving the mist-choked streets of Tidewatch Ward, you found shelter in the battered remains of the[ Salty Dog Tavern]—an old haunt of [[Skirk]]’s, now haunted by silence. Your arrival was anything but quiet: a skirmish with skull-shelled crabs and a monstrous frog left you bloodied but alive, and the tavern’s hidden corners soon yielded more than dust. [[Mistral]], uncovered cryptic pirate graffiti in thieves’ cant, hinting at secrets buried “where the rum runs dry and secrets sleep, behind the dog the gold runs deep.”

Your curiosity led you to a puzzle—a hidden mechanism that responded to the elements, opening a secret passage beneath the tavern. There, in a treasure vault, you faced animated armor, a mimic, disguised as a chest, and other enchanted guardians. Victory brought you gold, magical gear, and also a fragment of a pirate map, its clues pointing deeper into the ward and closer to some sort of Pearl.

As night fell, you kept watch from the tavern’s rooftop, glimpsing mutated “coral people” and stranger things moving through the fog. At dawn, a thunderous pulse of light erupted to the south, signaling dark rituals at work. Following the disturbance, you confronted cultists channeling storm magic through a crystal orb—fighting to destroy it before it could summon a tide of monsters. With teamwork and grit, they shattered the orb, scattering the cultists and earning a brief respite. Yet the dangers of the ward loom ever closer, as [[Mistral]]’s map and [[Jezrek Sprocketmonger]]'s Compass now beckoned you further south, toward the heart of the mystery.

### Session 01: Entering Tidewatch Ward & First Combat

- **Setting:** New Penmaris, rebuilt after the Flaming Retribution. Tidewatch Ward is sealed off, filled with monsters (Saltspawn), and adventurers are sent in as the city’s last hope.
- **Mission briefing:** PCs receive healing potions, a sending stone, and tracking runes. The gatekeeper warns: “If you see the fog move against the wind, run.”
- **Exploration:** The party enters the ward, finds it eerily quiet and derelict, and heads to the Salty Dog tavern (Skirk’s old haunt).
- **Combat:** Ambushed by bone crabs (undead, fused with coral and humanoid skulls) and a tentacled frog monster. The party works together, using tactics like flanking, resource management, and class abilities.
- **Aftermath:** The Salty Dog is secured as a defensible base. Mistral discovers graffiti in Thieves’ Cant referencing the Tidecutters pirate crew and a “pearl.” The tavern is established as a safe haven for short rests.
- **Roleplay:** PCs share drinks, discuss faith (Arthur and Xander), and set up religious wards and traps. Skirk finds the secret rum stash. The group investigates clues about the pearl and the pirates.

### Session 02: Puzzle, Treasure Vault, & Boss Fight

- **Puzzle:** Mistral deciphers a riddle in Thieves’ Cant: “Where the rum runs dry and secrets sleep, behind the dog the gold runs deep.” The party searches for a hidden vault, eventually finding a clockwork mechanism in the alley behind the tavern.
- **Vault:** Solving the elemental riddle (sea, flame, stone, wind), they unlock a secret door to a treasure room.
- **Combat:** The treasure room is trapped—animated armor, a mimic chest, and a rug of smothering attack the party. The group uses teamwork, luck points, and class features to defeat the threats.
- **Loot:** Each PC receives gold and a tailored magic item (e.g., Arthur gets plate armor and a +1 warhammer, Skirk gets a +1 anchor/flail, Mistral gets thunderfist wraps, etc.).
- **Plot clues:** Mistral finds a map fragment referencing the pearl’s location to the south.
- **Rest:** The party takes watches overnight. At dawn, a thunderous magical pulse erupts to the south, drawing their attention.
- **Boss Fight:** The party investigates and finds a ritual in progress—three corrupted figures (demonic influence) around a crystal ball. The crystal ball is summoning monsters each round until destroyed. The party must fight the cultists, destroy the orb, and survive waves of summoned creatures.
- **Resolution:** The orb is destroyed, the cultists defeated, and Skirk’s anchor gains a new lightning ability when wet. The party is left with clues pointing south, toward the pearl and further dangers.

## Unresolved Threads & Prep Hooks

1. **The Pearl:** The Tidecutters and cultists are searching for a mysterious pearl, referenced in pirate graffiti and treasure maps. Its location is to the south, and it’s likely tied to the ward’s corruption and the summoning ritual.
2. **Coralite:** Lil John’s quest for Coralite remains open—what monsters produce it, and what are its properties?
3. **Missing Fisherman:** Xander’s friend is still missing; clues may be found in the southern ward or among the monsters/cultists.
4. **Demon Hunt:** Arthur and Skirk’s original mission to find and destroy a demon is unresolved. The demonic influence in the cultists suggests a larger threat.
5. **Tidecutters:** The pirate crew is active, leaving coded messages and possibly seeking the pearl for their own ends.
6. **Party Base:** The Salty Dog tavern is established as a safe haven. PCs may need to defend it or use it as a staging ground for further exploration.
7. **New Magic Items:** Each PC has a new item—consider how these might influence tactics, roleplay, and future encounters.

## Suggestions for Next Session Prep

- **Plot Advancement:** Move the party south toward the pearl’s location. Introduce environmental hazards, new monsters (Saltspawn, coral-mutated creatures), and pirate/cultist opposition.
- **Personal Quests:** Drop clues about Xander’s fisherman, Lil John’s Coralite, and Arthur/Skirk’s demon. Consider NPCs or environmental storytelling.
- **Roleplay Beats:** Use the party’s new magic items for character moments (e.g., Skirk’s lightning anchor, Arthur’s plate armor). Highlight faith, guilt, rivalry, and camaraderie.
- **Encounters:** Mix combat (monsters, pirates, cultists) with exploration (ruins, puzzles, traps) and social scenes (refugees, survivors, rival adventurers).
- **Pacing:** Alternate between tense action (waves of monsters, time-sensitive objectives) and downtime (rest, investigation, party banter).
- **Foreshadowing:** Tease the true nature of the pearl, the demon’s influence, and the pirates’ motives.
