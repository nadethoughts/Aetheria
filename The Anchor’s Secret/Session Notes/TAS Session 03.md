# Recap
- The party continued their exploration of Tidewatch Ward, setting up camp in the Salty Dog Tavern, which they used as a base of operations. They encountered more mutated sea creatures (Salt Spawn), including bone crabs, frog-like monsters, and transparent alligators, as well as coral-encrusted humanoids patrolling the area. 
- Mistral discovered pirate graffiti and riddles in Thieves’ Cant, which hinted at hidden treasure behind the tavern. The group investigated and found a mechanical gear lock in the alley, which they solved by pointing it toward environmental cues representing the four elements (sea, flame, stone, and sky). 
- Unlocking the mechanism revealed a secret door leading to a treasure chamber. Inside, the party found piles of gold, magic items, and suits of armor. When they attempted to claim the loot, they were ambushed by a mimic disguised as a chest and animated objects (armor, rug, hammer). 
- After a tough fight, the party defeated the guardians and divided the treasure: each received 500 gold and a magic item tailored to their character (e.g., Plate Armor and +1 Warhammer for Arthur, Sentinel Shield and +1 Amulet of the Devout for Xander, Thunder Fist Hand Wraps for Mistral, Bracers of Archery for Lil John, Dockbreaker’s Chain for Skirk, and Bombastic Crossbow for Jezrek). 
- The group rested, kept watch, and observed strange phenomena in the ward, including fog that seemed to move with intent and more mutated creatures. At dawn, a magical surge to the south drew their attention, prompting them to prepare for further investigation. 
- The session ended with the party heading south toward a courtyard where they witnessed a Stormcaller cult ritual involving a crystal ball. Combat ensued against cultists and summoned monsters, culminating in the destruction of the crystal ball and the empowerment of Skirk’s anchor flail with lightning energy.
