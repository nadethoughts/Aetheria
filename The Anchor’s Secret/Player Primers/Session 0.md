## ⚓ **Session 0 Introduction: The City That Refused to Drown**

> _A year ago, Penmaris burned._  
> When the **[[Flaming Retribution]]** swept across the [[Verdant Strand]], the proud coastal city was swallowed by fire and storm.  
> The peninsula sank beneath the waves — all that remains is the island that was once its heart.
>
> Now, that island is **[[New Penmaris]]**, a city still finding its footing on the bones of the old.  
> It’s built mostly of wood and willpower — scaffolds and ship timbers hammered into half-finished streets, with only a few stone walls standing firm where the sea demands it.  
> The air smells of salt, sawdust, and smoke. The docks never sleep. Hope and hardship live side by side.
>
> But six months ago, that fragile peace shattered.  
> The **[[Tidewatch Ward]]**, the great seawall district that guards the harbor, was overrun by monsters and magically warped beasts.  
> The defenders fell back, sealing the ward behind walls and magic. Since then, the storms there haven’t stopped and the defenses are only just holding... for now.
>
> The [[New Penmaris - Iron Tide Regiment|Iron Tide Regiment]] calls for those with courage — **adventurers, wanderers, and heroes** — to cross the wall and reclaim what was lost.  
> You’ve each proven yourselves during the rebuilding: protecting workers, hunting threats, restoring fragments of the old city.  
> But what waits in the[[ Tidewatch Ward]] will test your skill and resolve…  
> Whether [[New Penmaris]] can truly survive the the tide rests in your hands.

### 🧭 What Is a Roleplaying Game

- You’ll each create a **character** who lives in the City of New Penmaris
- This is a Collaborative Story Telling game.

- When success or failure matters — climbing a wall, striking an enemy, persuading a guard — we’ll roll dice to see how it plays out.
- There’s no single “winning” or "losing" condition. The story is shaped by your actions, teamwork, and creativity.
