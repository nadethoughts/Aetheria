## 🗺️ **Player Primer, Part 1: Welcome to [[Aetheria]] & [[New Penmaris]]**

### **[[Aetheria]]: The World**
[[Aetheria]] is a planet shaped by cycles of magical disaster and renewal. Its lands are diverse—[[Dwarves]] rule the stone halls of [[Ironhold]], [[Elves]] dwell in the psychic forests of [[Luminael]], and [[The Blessed Realm]] shined with order and grace. The continent of **[[Solaris]]** is the center stage, with regions like the [[Free Cities of the Vale]], the [[Shimmering Shores]], and the resilient northern coast: ***[[The Verdant Strand]]***.

**What makes [[Aetheria]] different?**
- Magic is powerful but unpredictable, leaving scars and wonders across the land.
- Cultures are defined by resilience, adaptation, and the memory of past cataclysms.
- Ruins, wild magic zones, and communities built on survival and ingenuity are everywhere.

### **[[The Verdant Strand]]: The Northern Coast**
[[The Verdant Strand]] stretches along [[Solaris]]’s northern coast, marked by rocky cliffs, pine forests, and bustling trade towns. Its people are practical, community-focused, and skilled at sea and trade. After the recent magical disaster known as the **[[Flaming Retribution]]**, the Survivors of [[The Verdant Strand]] have sought to rebuild quickly.

### **[[New Penmaris]]: City of Survivors**
Penmaris was once a proud city on a peninsula. When the [[Flaming Retribution]] struck—a magical cataclysm that ended the 3rd Age and began the 4th—the peninsula was shattered, leaving an island. Today, [[New Penmaris]] has been rebuilt on that island and  is crowded with both natives and refugees from destroyed towns. Its harbors are busy, its politics tense, and its future uncertain.

### **The [[Flaming Retribution]]: Recent History**

One year ago, the [[Flaming Retribution]] swept across [[Aetheria]], destroying coastlines, unleashing wild magic, and changing the world forever. While Penmaris was heavily damaged, it was not detroyed and the city of [[New Penmaris]] was build on the remains of the old city and has become a beacon of hope and ambition in a changed world.

**Your adventure begins in the 4th Age, one year after the [[Flaming Retribution]]. You are among the few with the courage—and luck—to shape what comes next.**
