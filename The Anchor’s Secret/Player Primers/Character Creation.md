# ⚓ **Character Connection Prompts — Bonds of the Reclaimed City**

In the year since the Flaming Retribution, New Penmaris has struggled to rebuild. You each played a small part in holding the city together — and in doing so, you crossed paths with one another. Discuss the following prompts with your partner to decide what happened, what you learned, and what binds you still.

---

### 🧱 **1. Derek & Ian – The Breach in the Wall**

When the western sea wall cracked during an early spring tide, the two of you were among the volunteers who rushed to brace it before the flooding reached the markets.

- What improvised plan did you come up with to hold the wall?
- Who didn’t make it out, and what promise did you make in their memory?

---

### 🔥 **2. Derek & Jason – The Market Fire**

Months later, a fire tore through the harbor’s rebuilt stalls, threatening the dockside granaries.

- How did you two coordinate the effort to stop the blaze when both magic and water failed?
- What strange discovery in the ashes made you suspect Tidewatch’s ruin wasn’t a natural disaster?

---

### ⚓ **3. Dave & Ryan – The Tide That Shouldn’t Have Come**

A month ago, a strange, moonless tide rose and struck the docks without warning. You both were there, hauling people to safety as the waters climbed.

- What did you glimpse beneath the waves that others refused to believe?
- How did that moment change your view of New Penmaris — or of each other?

---

### 🌊 **4. Dave & Ian – The Drowned Shrine**

During the reconstruction of the harbor stairs, you uncovered a flooded shrine beneath the surface — its carvings still faintly glowing.

- What did you awaken when you disturbed the shrine?
- Why did you agree to keep what you found there a secret?

---

### 🕯️ **5. Ramsey & Jason – The Lantern Vigil**

During the memorial for those lost in the Flaming Retribution, you two helped launch lanterns into the bay from the temple pier.

- One lantern came back against the tide, its flame burning green instead of gold — what did you do with it?
- Why has that night stayed with you more than any other since?

---

### ⚙️ **6. Ramsey & Ryan – The Missing Convoy**

A caravan carrying tools, medicine, and food for the refugee camps vanished en route from the docks. You were part of the team that found what was left of it.

- What did you discover about who attacked the convoy — and what did you choose to tell the city officials?
- What small relic or token did you keep from that wreck, and why does it still matter to you?
