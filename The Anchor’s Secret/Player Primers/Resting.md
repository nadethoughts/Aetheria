## 🛏️ **Resting in Aetheria**
Even heroes must rest — but in the world scarred by the _Flaming Retribution_, rest is hard-won.  
Sleep brings only a measure of recovery; true renewal requires safety, warmth, and time.

### ⏳ **Short Rests**
A **Short Rest** is about one hour of quiet downtime — catching your breath, tending wounds, and refocusing your mind.

During a Short Rest:

- You can **spend Hit Dice** to regain HP.
- Class abilities that recharge on a Short Rest refresh as normal.
- You must remain **stationary and undisturbed** for the full hour.

> A short rest restores your breath — not your strength.

### 🌅 **Long Rests (House Rule)**
A **Long Rest** requires **a full day (24 hours)** of safety and comfort — time enough for the body to heal and the mind to find peace.  
This isn’t just sleep; it’s real recovery in a world that rarely offers it.

To gain the benefits of a Long Rest:
- Spend at least **one full day not adventuring** — no exploration, combat, or major travel.
- Be in a **safe, sheltered environment** with food, rest, and security.

When completed:
- Regain all HP and expended Hit Dice.
- Recover all spell slots and class abilities.
- Remove all exhaustion and temporary conditions.

> True rest is a gift — not a guarantee.

### ⚠️ **Unsafe Resting**
When heroes sleep in dangerous or unsettled areas (like the Tidewatch Ward), they **must rest**, but it isn’t truly restorative.

If you take an **Unsafe Rest**:

- You gain the **benefits of a Short Rest**, not a Long Rest.
- You **must sleep** at least 6 hours each day or **gain one level of exhaustion.**
- Exhaustion stacks normally until you find a safe place for a full Long Rest.
- The GM may roll for **wandering dangers** or other consequences of camping in the open.

> You can sleep in the Ward — but you’ll never wake rested. Only surviving another night.
