## **Scene One: The Gate of Tidewatch**

_(Opening Scene — Player-Facing Introduction & GM Notes)_

### 🎭 **Read Aloud: Arrival at the Tidewatch Wall**

> The **Mariner’s Ward** is alive with noise — hammers ring, gulls cry, and the air smells of sawdust and salt. Half-built taverns lean beside shipyards still under repair, and the blue-cloaked soldiers of the **Iron Tide Regiment** move through the crowds like sentinels of order in a city still finding its balance.
> 
> As you head east, the sounds of the ward fade. The streets grow emptier, the air colder. The wooden buildings give way to stone — and ahead, rising from the mist, you see the **Tidewatch Wall**.
> 
> It’s massive, slick with moss and sea growth. **Faint blue runes** glow across its surface, humming softly with old magic — wards meant to keep whatever lies beyond from getting through. A heavy **iron gate** sits at its center, chained and reinforced, with soldiers standing watch nearby.
> 
> One man steps forward as you approach. Broad-shouldered, weathered, his armor worn thin with years of service. A halberd rests beside him, and his sharp eyes look you over with the weight of someone who’s lost too many under his command.
> 
> “So you’re the ones they’re sending,” he says. “Figures. The Regiment’s out of volunteers.”
> 
> He glances back at the fog curling through the cracks in the gate.  
> 
> “Name’s **Fredrick Wainshore**. I’m the one who opens this door." He gives each of you a cursory glance, "Glad to see they have found some people with experience this time..."

### 👤 **Fredrick Wainshore, Iron Tide Gatekeeper**
![[Fredrick Wainshore.png]]
- **Rank:** Sergeant of the Iron Tide Regiment
- **Appearance:** Mid-forties, thick-shouldered, salt-gray hair tied back. His armor is oiled to resist the sea air, though barnacles still cling to the lower greaves. His halberd bears an engraved tide mark near the haft — ten years of service.
- **Personality:** Grizzled but professional; the kind of soldier who measures everyone by whether they’ll survive the night.
- **Voice:** Rough and deliberate, coastal dialect with clipped consonants.

### 🧭 **Fredrick Wainshore – Quick Reference**

**About the Mission**

- The Iron Tide Regiment has orders to _reclaim and stabilize_ the Tidewatch Ward.
- The players are being sent to **investigate the source of the fog** and any threats within.
- They’re to report back any discoveries — especially if it relates to the **creatures** or **magical disturbances**.
- “You’re not here to fight a war. You’re here to find out what’s still fighting one.”
---
**About the Tidewatch Ward**

- Once a harbor district — now flooded, fog-choked, and mostly abandoned.
- **No civilians remain**; the area’s been quarantined for six months.
- The Regiment holds the wall, but **nothing beyond it is secure**.
- Patrols stopped three months ago after repeated losses.
---

**About the Fog**

- Not natural — comes and goes with the tide but _moves against the wind_.
- Warps sound and light; “sometimes you hear your own voice coming back wrong.”
- The fog is **cold**, even when the sun’s up — and sometimes it glows faintly blue.
- “Things move inside it. Slow. Like they’re watching.”

---

**About the Creatures**

- **Bone Crabs** are common — twisted remnants of sea life, fused with bone and magic.
- Something bigger has started **feeding on them** — “the fog’s getting hungrier.”
- Corpses from failed expeditions often wash back up along the inner wall.
---
**About the Regiment**

- The **Iron Tide Regiment** was formed from veterans of the Flaming Retribution.
- Their duty is to **protect the city**, not reclaim the Ward — that’s why the PCs are here.
- “Orders from the council don’t mean much if the wall doesn’t hold.”

---

**Rumors & Warnings**
- “The fog hums before a storm.”
- “If you hear bells underwater, run.”
- “Don’t use open flame — the air gets strange when you do.”
- “If the runes on the wall stop glowing, get back here _fast_.”

---

### 🧱 **The Setting of the Gate**

- The **Tidewatch Wall** is 25 feet thick at its base, made from stone quarried from the old peninsula before it sank.
- The **Iron Gate** has sigils carved into it — old wards against storm and spirit, now worn thin.
- A **barracks and armory** sit just inside the safer side of the wall; the soldiers refuse to sleep near the gate itself anymore.
- **Sound design (for atmosphere):** distant waves, muffled shouting from patrols, the low groan of metal under pressure.

### 🎭 **Read Aloud: Passing Through**

> Fredrick nods once, then signals to a pair of soldiers on the wall. The great gate shudders open, scraping against salt-scored stone. The smell of brine and decay seeps out as fog rolls toward you like breath from a dying beast.
> 
> “One last thing,” Fredrick says quietly. “If you see the fog move _against_ the wind… run.”
> 
> The gate groans shut behind you with a clang that echoes off the drowned buildings beyond. Ahead lies a street half-swallowed by mist, where shattered boats and carts lie stranded in stagnant water.

---

### ⚔️ **The Bone Crab Ambush**

> You take only a few steps before the quiet breaks.
> 
> A wet, hollow _clicking_ fills the air — claws tapping stone, bone scraping shell. From the fog, a dozen shapes emerge, their limbs made from fused skeletons and carapace shards. They move low and fast, glowing blue eyes set deep in skull-like shells.
> 
> The **Bone Crabs** scuttle closer, their bodies glinting like pale coral in the dim light.

**Encounter Notes:**

- **CR:** Low to moderate — intended as a warm-up encounter.
- **Tactics:** Swarm behavior, target isolated PCs.
- **Environmental Detail:** Broken planks, tide pools, rusted nets, and barnacle-crusted debris provide difficult terrain.

### 💀 **Read Aloud: The Yann-An-Oed’s Arrival**

> Just as the last crab collapses, the mist begins to twist — swirling inward, as though drawn by something unseen.
> 
> From the fog, a heavy _thud_ shakes the street, followed by the sound of something tearing flesh from shell. The air smells of rot and seawater.
> 
> The fog shifts, and for a moment you see it — a massive, translucent creature with too many limbs, its surface slick and veined with faint blue light. A **Yann-An-Oed**, half-formed and hungry.
> 
> It drags a crab into its beaked maw and sinks back into the mist, leaving behind silence — and the realization that you are not alone in this ward.
