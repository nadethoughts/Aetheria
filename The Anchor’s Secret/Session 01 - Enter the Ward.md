## **Scene One: The Gate of Tidewatch**

_(Opening Scene — Player-Facing Introduction & GM Notes)_

### 🎭 **Read Aloud: Arrival at the Tidewatch Wall**

> The **Mariner’s Ward** is alive with noise — hammers ring, gulls cry, and the air smells of sawdust and salt. Half-built taverns lean beside shipyards still under repair, and the blue-cloaked soldiers of the **Iron Tide Regiment** move through the crowds like sentinels of order in a city still finding its balance.
> 
> As you head east, the sounds of the ward fade. The streets grow emptier, the air colder. The wooden buildings give way to stone — and ahead, rising from the mist, you see the **Tidewatch Wall**.
> 
> It’s massive, slick with moss and sea growth. **Faint blue runes** glow across its surface, humming softly with old magic — wards meant to keep whatever lies beyond from getting through. A heavy **iron gate** sits at its center, chained and reinforced, with soldiers standing watch nearby.
> 
> One man steps forward as you approach. Broad-shouldered, weathered, his armor worn thin with years of service. A halberd rests beside him, and his sharp eyes look you over with the weight of someone who’s lost too many under his command.
> 
> “So you’re the ones they’re sending,” he says. “Figures. The Regiment’s out of volunteers.”
> 
> He glances back at the fog curling through the cracks in the gate.  
> 
> “Name’s **Fredrick Wainshore**. I’m the one who opens this door. Glad to see they have found some people with experience this time..."

### 👤 **Fredrick Wainshore, Iron Tide Gatekeeper**

- **Rank:** Sergeant of the Iron Tide Regiment
- **Appearance:** Mid-forties, thick-shouldered, salt-gray hair tied back. His armor is oiled to resist the sea air, though barnacles still cling to the lower greaves. His halberd bears an engraved tide mark near the haft — ten years of service.
- **Personality:** Grizzled but professional; the kind of soldier who measures everyone by whether they’ll survive the night.
- **Voice:** Rough and deliberate, coastal dialect with clipped consonants.

#### **Fredrick’s Greeting**

> “So you’re the ones they sent.” _He studies each of you like a quartermaster inspecting weapons._  
> “You’re not conscripts, then. That’s good. The Regiment needs specialists — people who can think, not just march.”
> 
> _He gestures at the gate behind him._  
> “Tidewatch’s gone bad. The fog took it six months ago, and nothing we send in comes back whole. We’ve orders to hold the wall… but the brass says you’re to go _through_ it. Guess that means you’re either our salvation or our next report to the quartermaster.”

### 💬 **Information Fredrick Can Share (If Questioned or Roleplayed With)**

- **About the Mission:** “You’re being sent to **survey and stabilize** the ward — find out what’s stirring the fog and stop it if you can. We’ve lost patrols, and something big’s been moving beneath the streets.”
    
- **About the Iron Tide Regiment:** “We keep the city safe from whatever the Retribution left behind. The council gives orders, but we’re the ones who bleed for ‘em.”
    
- **About the Fog:** “It’s not weather — it’s alive. It rolls in and out like a tide, always colder in the middle. Nothing good happens where the mist gets thickest.”
    
- **About the Tidewatch Ward:** “Used to be shipwrights, fishmongers, taverns on every corner. Now? Just wreckage, salt, and bones. You’ll find cargo washed up in alleys — and sometimes the hands that hauled it.”
    
- **About Reinforcements:** “You’re on your own past this gate. We can’t spare a squad, and the fog blocks signals. If you need backup, you’ll have to come back to us — assuming you can.”
    
- **Rumors:** “Something’s feeding down there. The Bone Crabs have been restless — bigger, meaner. And last week, we heard something _eating them._ Like the sea itself got hungry.”

### 🧱 **The Setting of the Gate**

- The **Tidewatch Wall** is 25 feet thick at its base, made from stone quarried from the old peninsula before it sank.
    
- The **Iron Gate** has sigils carved into it — old wards against storm and spirit, now worn thin.
    
- A **barracks and armory** sit just inside the safer side of the wall; the soldiers refuse to sleep near the gate itself anymore.
    
- **Sound design (for atmosphere):** distant waves, muffled shouting from patrols, the low groan of metal under pressure.

### 🎭 **Read Aloud: Passing Through**

> Fredrick nods once, then signals to a pair of soldiers on the wall. The great gate shudders open, scraping against salt-scored stone. The smell of brine and decay seeps out as fog rolls toward you like breath from a dying beast.
> 
> “One last thing,” Fredrick says quietly. “If you see the fog move _against_ the wind… run.”
> 
> The gate groans shut behind you with a clang that echoes off the drowned buildings beyond. Ahead lies a street half-swallowed by mist, where shattered boats and carts lie stranded in stagnant water.

### ⚔️ **The Bone Crab Ambush**

> You take only a few steps before the quiet breaks.
> 
> A wet, hollow _clicking_ fills the air — claws tapping stone, bone scraping shell. From the fog, a dozen shapes emerge, their limbs made from fused skeletons and carapace shards. They move low and fast, glowing blue eyes set deep in skull-like shells.
> 
> The **Bone Crabs** scuttle closer, their bodies glinting like pale coral in the dim light.

**Encounter Notes:**

- **CR:** Low to moderate — intended as a warm-up encounter.
    
- **Tactics:** Swarm behavior, target isolated PCs.
    
- **Environmental Detail:** Broken planks, tide pools, rusted nets, and barnacle-crusted debris provide difficult terrain.

### 💀 **Read Aloud: The Yann-An-Oed’s Arrival**

> Just as the last crab collapses, the mist begins to twist — swirling inward, as though drawn by something unseen.
> 
> From the fog, a heavy _thud_ shakes the street, followed by the sound of something tearing flesh from shell. The air smells of rot and seawater.
> 
> The fog shifts, and for a moment you see it — a massive, translucent creature with too many limbs, its surface slick and veined with faint blue light. A **Yann-An-Oed**, half-formed and hungry.
> 
> It drags a crab into its beaked maw and sinks back into the mist, leaving behind silence — and the realization that you are not alone in this ward.
