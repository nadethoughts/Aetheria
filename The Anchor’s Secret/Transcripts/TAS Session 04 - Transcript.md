# Transcript
don't know those ghosts they threw a rock yeah i silenced some dude uh-huh we murdered the hell
out of them we yeah and we met with the looking for the money and they were pirates they were
after that pirates they're after a monk that's right and yep and we met with the the people
who had been sent into the tide walking district beforehand and they might be military people
yep yep they were like coral five yep or we thought we would become coral five too yep and one of us
started to become coral five yep actually two of you did two two i know he casted a bunch of spells
decoralize himself yeah he did decoralize himself well it's became coral five i think i'm starting
too well i haven't seen it yet but i definitely fail to save at the end oh yeah yeah all right well
that's probably not helpful for those of you who weren't here yet so let's uh everyone's off let's
cry let's cry hey hey hey no it's it it's good it's um so last time
uh you were recovering from the battle that you had with the um
it's the uh cult if you remember there was the oh i hope that you were fighting
uh there was this big crystal ball that had a storm inside it
yes sturch hit the crystal ball with crystal ball with his anchor and all of a sudden got a magical
anchor um flail thing now um at the end of that you guys were getting were basically you know
rummaging through the bodies see what you could find and that kind of thing when you heard the
telltale sign of additional people coming up um you were approached by a robed and hooded um person
who call who called you pirates and was threatening to cause threatening to um cause some sort of
horrible thing didn't happen to you or attack you or something uh if you didn't leave you identified
yourselves not as pirates and convinced them that you in fact were not um and then as you were about
to start a conversation real pirates showed up and we beat your ass you guys hid but not well enough
uh for some of you uh for some of you and were um and were discovered by the pirates you dispatched
the pirates um while um while you dispatched two of them while the other four that were in the area
were blissfully unaware of what was happening because there was a very um very strategically cast silence spell
that happened in the area that happened in the area that made all of the sounds of battle
disappear and the big rock that was thrown and the big rock that was okay
um so you dispatched those um pirates and then the leader of the group
um i'll just go ahead and throw that up veric thorn um revealed to you uh that they had a couple of
they had a couple of encampments in the area um and they and he invited you to come back to him uh you
followed him to his uh to his stronghold and there xander discovered his fisherman friend who had been
um transmorphed into some sort of coral person it was also well not a coral person yeah yeah he had
he had cold growth another tumor yeah so it like and the person that you were uh the person that you
were talking to varic um likewise had some coral growths as well um it's almost like his body was
in the sea was one of the stones that coral just decided to attach to and grow on top of
um everybody who was a part of that group had similar sort of mutations it was discovered that the
this is what's left of the iron tide regiment that is in um that's in the tide watch war
uh they refer to themselves as coral marked
um once there you discovered that there is a number of um
uh that there are a number of factions that are in play in the tide watch war um there are the there
are dockhand um
automatons yeah automatons i was i was looking for a different word but tom con works um robots yeah that
that that was rocks constructs that were opened up the box um so they're they're dock worker
constructs that have gained sentience and attack on site um nobody survived any contact with them
whatsoever to the north in the docks to the south um there is the uh storm collar cult which you guys dealt
with already um which apparently in the recent past about a month ago um they started developing different
mutations than what everybody else had their mutations have a tendency to be things that are a little bit
more um infernal or humanic um which you would which uh the two people that were hired to or that were
repositioned to go and kill a demon suspect that maybe that might have something to do with those
coming up there and there are also the pirates and the pirates have do not have any sort of don't have
any sort of mutations whatsoever um but they are they are constantly trying to make it into the ward and
they're moving towards the center of the ward also um they're in the center of the ward there is a
gaggle of what uh of pearl bound um creatures um that you discover when talking with varic uh that
they are the corpses of everything uh of any sentient creature that's died inside the ward um after about
12 hours if the body is not burned that body grows um pearl pearls what looks to be pearls over their eyes
and they become um and their their skin starts having bioluminescent they bioluminescence going through
their veins and they develop um even more pronounced coral growths um they don't appear to have any kind of
sentience anymore um but they are kind of like surrounding the center of the ward um also the
the cult what what it was doing when you guys attacked it um it appears that they were trying to
attract the pearl bound out of the area that the pearl bound were in so there's clearly something inside
that area that is that is of value that the pirates the cults want um the coral march uh or the iron
tide regiment doesn't really know what it is um but they know that there's something going on
there's a uh in the center of that big place like there there's a temple of moraine that flashed in
light right before um the the monsters attack and the storm moved in so whatever it is they're looking
for um it looks like it might be in that temple um the group up into the group decided that you had discussed um
you you decided that the next logical thing for you to do um is to go and parlay with the pirates
to see if you can gain any more detailed information
and i think that's where we left it did i forget anything that anybody else remembers the pirates we
just fought and killed some of yeah those ones
i think the reasoning was they're after
mr
anyway
and so like
it hasn't fallen us for a while so we kind of wanted to get them off our backs
because when they came when they fought us
like they were specifically looking for mistral and we're like we don't want to be dealing with these other problems
when pirates might just randomly be showing up trying to kill mistral or trying to deal with something else
yeah i think was the yeah that was my reasoning
yeah he had a better reason that i don't really agree with
yeah
my reason was we all have the zombie curse
and if any of us get out of here it's gonna be real bad and they have a poor curse
uh it's all of us yeah
that's that's that's a good that's a good a good thing um the zombie curse uh was
dis um it's not a it's not specifically a zombie curse that is xander's and ferns
could be could not be
but what you do know is that the longer that you stay in the ward the more likely it is that you're
going to develop these growths i've been in here longer than all of these guys
and there is a um and it's very likely um that you know that the well
in game mechanic wise every every time that you every day that passes every time you sleep
i'm going to be asking for a constitution save we haven't slept since the last time right
we slept last session i slept last session i'm not going to make you make a constitution save for a
for a session right here that's fine you don't get the long rest either then
so we did it is a long yeah we did long rest yes yeah you did get a long rest um
um and the um i was it was discovered that this it was originally thought that this was going to be a
disease that is not a disease it's a curse because ruther was able to decursify himself
because he was going to develop a growth
so i think that's it it's a curse i think that's it all right i'm willing to stipulate
that that was a slightly better summary of last session than what we gave
so just just a little bit just to be clear do we know why they want miss over no zero no clues
mistral do you know they want you negative is he telling the truth
he's a monk they don't lie
i think that um
i think that jason might not jason might not know but mistral might have a clue
and the clue would be somewhere around you got what is the item that you that you that you've
been walking around oh i have a fire move yeah you got treasure map so okay well he hasn't yeah
so whether or not he chooses yeah you share that it's his own business but um yeah miss roe you
won't be able to figure out that oh yeah you have a pirate map you have a pirate treasure map
um and you actually have a second part of it that you picked up in the in the pirate vault so the map
that you have correct it is definitely the same the same map that these pirates have been working with
um it's just a different part of it so i think that's a logical thing that you could have ascertained
oh when the other thing we found is we do know where the pirates come in and out yeah so we know
like there's a stretch of shore that they kind of if we want to go try to track them down we know where
to go find them yeah but it's like several miles it was like 10 miles or something ridiculous uh four
miles okay well it was a number of i was i said it was a number of miles i was correct the ridiculous
number is the size of the actual i've watched yeah the fact that a one district is
far be it for me to i'm not exactly the our laying type but cannot which must be very shocking for
you derek but we all think it's a good idea you think it's a good idea let's go i'm not certain
they're going to give us the chance but oh they'll give us the chance let me have something they
want we don't know how many there there are well there's two less than there were yesterday
how many people normally
sail ships um
some ships are bigger than others all right but as far as like pirate vessels are concerned
you are probably looking at a minimum uh to to men a galleon you're looking at uh this ain't the
black pearl where you need four people yeah um yeah galleons are big ships uh-huh yeah pirates don't
scale galleon most of the time slow i know i know fair enough um i'm uh basically the the
crews of a pirate ship uh-huh i guess yeah well i've been saying galleon apparently i don't know
what galleon is um galleon's a big treasure ship yes um but uh you'd be looking at a crew of uh
minimum crew of um 35 to 40 people it'd be funny if it was a treasure ship and the treasure map
pointed to the ship the whole time you know 35 that's only seven a piece i can tell
i can take them and i did have a little breakfast
oh
that's crazy one all right
the reality was that they were going to pack them off their little robo so it won't be all
forward that's true yeah yeah and yeah and the uh and also the general thought behind it if i
remember correctly was that um these pirates follow the code ideally so
being able to say parlay to them to them before they kill you may save you i think was the general
thought
huh also you can say that should have some of all also i don't think many of us are very smart so we
didn't have good ideas
yeah i don't think we have very many intelligent people
the intelligent person wasn't here last time
but he's a thrill seeker so all right let's do it
let it be known
that i we all might die which i'm totally fine with you're gonna die soon anyway
exactly it's not let's be out in place of glory it's not so bad
better than this
i mean that's not what this is but yeah
i don't know we're not gonna die there's only 40 of them
i'll be fingers you have six probably
i probably got three on each hand i'm guessing
i got balls yeah i probably got like two and a thumb i'm guessing
maybe three and a thumb he's a he's a teach me just turtle
oh wow yes yeah and everybody should learn how to manipulate
yeah crab hands oh
you know i was like the only one that did that
well i think teach me the turtles i learned how to manipulate my hands
oh i do believe you wanted to do that i mean i do know how to learn how to do live long and process
yeah i did that from star trek yeah no digital was my thing is like i i literally was like okay
they've got to play things so if of course i'm gonna go and talk to these pirates which i'm not
saying is a bad idea but do we have anything to bargain with me just again that's a person yeah
what if they would just want to kill him we at least got close enough and we can kill him back
we'll have to kill him back yes the only black thing that is they're not weapons do they you
don't know that what's a cannon
the guy who worked on a doc isn't telling i like what's a can
intelligence of eight that's probably didn't know the real word for it
yeah
oh
sailors oh man there we go well exhausted all of my logic let's go do this thing they've proven that
your logic is not logical it's clearly it's fallible logic was applied to cobalt hey
what watch what you say
family game fallible
they're boulder biters well they are
we're trying to be discreet we're not discreet anymore
all right
so the group is going to move towards
the coach
i hope so because that's what we told chris we were going to do it that you would have to
replay it if we saw the ball right we'd roll with the bunch yeah i think i i think i can do this
yes the plan was for you guys to go and meet the pirates if you don't want to do that anymore
you can make it work it's like goat league pirates yep no big deal all right so you guys had head that
direction so we're going to we're going to jump into more this is not really downtime but it's
going to take you a while to get across the board
specifically because of all the the monsters and the and the creatures that you have to avoid and
that kind of thing so we are going to fast forward
but as part of the fast forward i'm going to have some people make some goals
we're going to count tables exactly um
so can i steal one of these dr pepper go for it i brought them for you thank you oh you brought them
um okay like yeah absolutely take my hands take six of them or whatever
um okay so uh we're we're basically gonna we're gonna make a d20 roll whoever whatever whoever
it is who wants to do it can do it um and you have to pick higher low um and we'll go from there
he's got it do it go for it what you got oh that is low four four four looks like a four right four and
low though four okay so you're traveling to the first waypoint of the um
of the uh coral marked um or this coral marked camp uh your it goes without incident
or at least without mentionable incident yeah um as you're going you obviously you see a bunch of
things there's a bunch of really um really interesting monstrous sites that you can see
um the first waypoint is about halfway um to the um to the coast which takes you a couple days to get
there um we'll go ahead and have everybody roll uh a constitution save dc well you notice as we're traveling
throughout throughout this whole day like skirk is itching himself
oh no he's started like he's convinced himself that he's
he's yeah he's got a growth already even if he doesn't hypochondria
uh rule eight constitution save so rule d20
and then uh there's and then there's the
area you're not supposed to be real good yeah but i won't listen to bars
and above what dc uh dc 12. oh well i'm using one yes me
what's up
top did okay so where the heart is the same is the top most number so that's a three
that you add to your d20 volt see the 20 mm-hmm yeah
18 all right so you got a 21 so you pass because the the target number that you're looking for is 12
isn't i got a
15. all right you pass 70. pass all right everybody passes
um near the end of the second day
you make it over to uh their camp as given instruction by them while this is happening
like i want to give everybody an opportunity if you've got anything that like how's your care
how's your character feeling what do you have what are uh what are your thoughts about what's happening
you know that kind of thing i want to give you guys an opportunity to kind of dive into that a little
bit so um as as uh jezric because we're moving a little bit stealthier through this because we're
trying to avoid combat and all that stuff uh you can see jezric uh if like he's not putting on a
performance but he is fully like doing the secret agent like i run the corner look okay
unnecessary rule
like he's just living life
skirk's definitely got the big scratches going now
like everyone else you see something growing
you see this to be purple oh no
did anybody have a uh a nightly ritual that their characters performed before they go to bed or
kind of a uh
kind of more about like just getting ready for bed these are these are the things i always do and that
kind of thing
zander probably has
like a little
notebook or journal or something
that he writes it that he writes it every night that makes sense
um
kind of almost in place of like he does it very ritually like almost in place of what would normally be like
ritual prayer he does this instead
all right
can you take jerry like you said for about four if everything goes right it's four miles
four oh it's four miles but you know given the layout of the land and the complexity of
it's uh complexity of this yeah it takes you it takes you two days it takes you halfway so it's
taking you two days to get two miles okay okay and that that is where we're at now
so we're on we're on the evening of day two
next time yep um
so jason does miss it'll have any uh you're walking towards a pirate group that is hunting you
how does mr feel about what's happening here
just out of curiosity
you thinking about your mom how much you love her or you know
um i love long lost
no honestly i think he's still playing it kind of cool uh
with the with his criminal background he's kind of used to
being big yeah being hunted being sets being kind of on the uh the hit list okay there's a twist
his mom is the pirate captain
the admiral yeah yeah um
um ryan um will john's been pretty uh pretty quiet up until up until this point except for the occasional
the occasional jab um or uh social joust so um
what what's what's he think about like everything that's happened up until this point
i think that's some or rituals that kind of prepare for war
so i think we're going to go south and he's going to go
his seven plus six of his
run away he's offended
yes i'm many thinking about fast okay i might have to stand my ground
awesome sharpening my two
what are these they're called
axes
oh okay one of the other things that happens when we are
camped for the night skirk takes out his flail and kind of shows it to jesrek he's like can you make this spark again it sparked before
i don't know i don't know how it sparks
uh i have a feature that i can comprehend who much of got it oh
that's handy yeah yeah so inside me i just saw a problem with a class feature
if i if i study his magic item yeah i should be able to tell him how it works
okay so
you study his magic item
perfect you uh takes you a couple hours
or an hour i don't know how long that class feature works however long class feature works
tell him that i'd have to get the ball from randy
but uh
yeah you you look over you look over the uh the anchor flail and it is 100%
a plus one weapon now just fully plus one weapon um you it has a special property on it
um that you haven't really ever seen before but it's
really interesting in how you know how it functions
you mentioned that it sparks and as you're going through and just kind of assessing
like how how this thing works well first things first this is like an artifact now it's not it's
not just an anchor it's not just an anchor yes it's an artifact i got magic found
second thing that you know is that it has a trigger to cause a additional to cause additional damage
um and you kind of discover this slightly on accident but like as you're going through your different
things you like to pour some some something yes wet on it yeah yeah and then it just comes to life
um and as far as you can tell it's like if you get this anchor wet um then it produces
um a lightning uh a lightning attack um so in game terms and dave already knows this but in game
terms they knew this it's Kirk is a moron yeah um game terms if you if you douse this in water
then it will gain a plus two d6 to it's to its hits okay um for a limited time yeah
yeah okay well you can see it's just magical it wasn't before right of course everybody can see that
yeah all right i knew that
gnomes work in mysterious ways
i will take out my water skin and especially i will i'll have him hold the anchor i'm like here
hang up hang on to this and i thank you for giving my anchor back i will dump water on it
actually don't i'm probably holding on to it yeah it's still there pull 2d6
oh oh seven it takes seven points
how did you make me do that
you learned by experience now you have a core memory tied to the anchor
i don't know now you'll know what it does all the time you could have just told me i could have
it would have really sunk in you're staying
i'm not sure he did so all i have to do is get it wet yeah so like if i hit somebody hard enough
their blood will make it wet
excellent
it's mostly water uh
probably just carry an extra water skin though it's easier let's find out stand still
go back to what i was doing before which is
setting traps around my campsite
i'll always just pee on it it's mostly water it's true
yeah but so is blood so it's the same thing if one doesn't work the other one
that is legit however peeing on your anchor is a full round action
i mean just saying that's your entire combat turn oh fair enough it's a bonus act it's a bonus
action to you know whip it out and another and a full action dash
it's like my anchor makes light in this anchor
okay the shirt then thought yeah i did not okay i'm gonna try to find some extra water skins too
because that's the smart thing to do
if we have to and um mechanically um treat a treat dousing it in water with the water skin
as a potion so it would see a bonus action
so all right potions are primal too one or two that's true i could put a healing potion on it
and then heal someone
well we can try the anchor compels you
see when you add lightning to things they come back to life
looking for a healing potion it becomes an anchor of resurrection yes all right all right all right
it's uh oh after i'm done setting up my traps and then they're mainly just like
things to that are sort of hidden that will wake me up and then yeah then you know
i don't know i'll summon
fall trap or something okay it's easy stuff to set up and take down yeah um i will go over to xander
i don't know
so you've you've heard it too the call the call to die
state so much i've heard it oh wow
well they're having their interaction with chris uh
uh kirk is going to get a little bit of her a long time friendly payback that guy
what's it better
chesric yep and go and more than you tinker with some of his traps
this release kind of looks around it's a nightmare
they certainly want to sign on tinker into chat
a lot
so we're just going to go off randomly in the middle of the night
okay he's going to be on more okay
i might be on a couple of them
you'll never know yeah you'll be touching your dress
returned to my family that's good okay cool well but i guess it makes sense why i'm going to talk to
some pirates
um so at at the uh at the end of the at the end of the second day you guys do make it to
the next uh the next coral mart outpost um you find a similar setup it's not just um
well first off i i do have to i do have to resolve some things
uh-huh uh-huh so uh-huh um jasric yeah um i
throughout the night the the first night you um run into a
you don't mean anything you're you are awoken multiple times by your traps going off
which would which immediately alerts you to there must be some sort of danger oh yeah
oh yeah and you run over there and
and that and after the second or third time that happens you start to wonder if maybe
maybe maybe this place is haunted
either one or something else but there's something that's triggering these things
and it doesn't appear to be horrible okay so uh so there's like no tracks or anything that i can see
or anything like that and it's not magical uh go ahead and roll uh survive perfect it is definitely
not magical
well could be there's lots of magic here uh no yeah there are no tracks zero tracks you can't find
anything all right there's something something's afoot
nothing's afoot because there's no tracks so it is a ghost it's a ghost um okay so that's that's that
you guys continue on um jasric you're probably a little bit more on alert looking out for these
ghosty ghost poker guys whatever it is um as you are
as you are making it to the first outpost on your trip
you see something off in the distance you're actually approaching that that
barrier where like there's a pearl bound like zombie-esque creatures they're not actually zombies zombies but
it's the best thing you can associate them i certainly wrote down pearl bomb zombies
um so you're you're approaching the border and you see something that kind of spooks you
um there is a suit of armor that is that has
there's a suit of armor that appears to have like a um a translucent a translucent um water
body body like no bones and but
it's it's basically it it looks like kind of like a a ghostly um apparition inside the armor um
you know if i hit that it'll make my axe lightening up but you see
the water goes
but in any case uh so you see that kind of like in the border and it appears to be watching you
but it doesn't appear to be
like moving in aggressively like a um so it's like a century that's just it's just watching yeah
and it kind of follows you along as you're as you're kind of skirting is this the first like
bit of intelligence from this this area of monsters that i've seen yes yeah
these guys don't think
yeah less
wonder if they're evolving or something
well
pirates
so you were given an opportunity to um bed down in a safe space in the um in the coral marked outpost
yeah they will accept you kindly with you know the uh with the recommendation and the um and seal of
varick uh captain varick
uh so once you actually uh once you get there um you are welcomed given given food shelter uh you can
either choose to just spend the night or you can choose to do a a long rest which would be another
full day um it's your choice
i can't imagine any of us has been hurt
enough
i'm going to see if i can acquisition some salt
okay oh i got some salt for you that's there'd be ghosts here but anybody knows that ghosts can't
cross a salt circle um well you are able to get some salt uh they do have i mean
there's definitely sea salt that they have available um so you can you can get some of that perfect
all right all right anything else you guys want to do while you are safe and sound
okay so go ahead and roll me a con save
uh dc12 so you pull that d20
well now it's gonna be scritching find the heart
thanks for that with me 17 17. all right no 16. 60. uh that is a grain total
uh seven yeah yeah i also got seven i got a six oh my gosh okay dice are fired
okay let's go back to the red barbarian dice
so um the three of you um why don't you the easiest way to do it
uh can you go ahead and put the tick on your character somewhere um ramsey specifically
xander yeah um you you're you you wake with um you wake up like you had some itching on like the
back of your neck and you and you wake up um in the morning and it's even more um the more agitated
yeah um use um when you look in the mirror like you know your hair isn't like super long but it's
long enough to cover the back of your neck and you look in the mirror kind of pull it up a little bit
and you see some um some pale orange um scaling that's happening in your neck
um excellent nope real this time i don't think uh i don't think that's right um it's been itching for
days i knew it uh the two of you guys you like um you don't have that discoloration like like for
jezric your forearm is kind of a little bit itchy it's it's like it's like weird and it spreads it's
like you're ashy right so it's just dry skin is kind of what it feels like that's itchy dry skin
and um same thing with skirk um but it's your it's your calf spreading
you know if you're itching it you gotta stop itching it you don't itch it it would spread it's like
poison eye but it itches what you gotta do is you gotta take a bath it goes all over your body
do cobalt mold mold how else are they supposed to become a dragon
good point good point fair enough it also feels like you have to mold
all right yeah so you're moving on to the pirates the the pirates layer there is one more there's
one more um touch there's one more uh place to go or um outpost that is available um and it's about
half a day's journey from the coast so that's generally what was recommended okay to go from
outpost outpost in the middle yeah over the coast um which is another that's another two-day
journey um i'm gonna need somebody to roll d20 i'll take this one and pick higher low hi
i have faith that my dice will have not failed me anymore it's brave of you i was wrong
uh uh looks like four okay that was not high okay not that high almost now i'm going to need
somebody to roll a d4
uh where was to take that one okay everybody uh you this has not been an easy journey for you all
all um you've actually run into a few different um groupings of monsters um you were able to
defeat them um but your resources have been reduced by one quarter so reduce your hit dice
by i guess at this point it'd be you only have three hit dice yeah so be reduce your hit die
by one um if you've got any spells you know reduce that by minimum of one but just a quarter
of what you have um and uh yeah it's 28 pills uh that's two uh yeah so your um your hit dice
you've got two or you should have three dependence that you tend to um oh yeah i assume i lose one
of my three rages uh yes and what about consumable resources like healing potions and whatnot um
i'm not gonna i'm not gonna pull out okay any consumables okay so you can still add your
consumables okay um
but just wanted to basically kind of represent you guys have been it's been a little bit harder of a
yep ours has been tracked for you so things are reduced now i need somebody to roll a d6
can i get in trouble one character well yeah four
okay okay so your two your your dick your uh hit dice uh change your max to three because you should
have three now instead of two and then just in the used column just make it one used
yeah okay okay
oh hold this okay
oh
hold this
and we could design our own math levels
okay
Well, why'd you choose the couple of five?
Because I felt like it was going to turn around.
Yeah, I don't know.
Let's see where hope gets you.
Hope in one hand and it's getting the other.
Let's see which one fills up fast.
Good, thank you.
So you guys are skirting along the coast a bit.
Everybody drop your guys over here.
Which way are we traveling here?
Traveling to that.
Okay, so Skirk is probably near the front somewhere.
I'm rolling to a cover spot.
Are you doing like music the whole time?
Like what's his name?
The guy.
You're going to have to be more specific than that.
Not the guy.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, the boys are designed specifically for Kusak.
Oh, more in.
Oh, no, not that.
Not that.
What?
Kronk.
Yes.
Cool.
What the hell?
Why did my brain go to bed?
No, I didn't.
Same actions.
I'm just not coming to myself.
I'm not helping.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
So you guys are traveling along the coast here, moving towards the outpost, which is a little bit further, a little bit further out.
So as you as you as you head that direction, you get a little bit close to water here.
And this isn't actually like this ocean.
This is more of like, just kind of, or at least this shouldn't be the ocean, I guess is the best way to put it.
So this is inland, but right, right when you get here, like you just see water heading out that direction.
It's like a tidal pool.
Yeah, kind of.
Yeah, exactly.
No, not kind of.
It is a tidal pool.
Exactly.
I don't believe.
And then from inside that pool, you see, you don't notice it initially, but then all of a sudden you see a giant, a giant splash.
Inside it.
And this monstrous creature that.
Hell, he doesn't look that big.
Kind of.
Hell, that looked like that big.
Oh, it's that big.
Oh.
Pretty big.
Erupts from the water.
And it.
And it appears to be interacting.
Okay.
With.
Those ones are big too.
Two creatures over.
Over there.
And these creatures kind of look, these ones look very similar to that one that was eating the, that was, that was eating the bone crabs.
Um, so it's got like, you know, these eye stalks.
It's got these tentacles, but it's basically a big frog.
In this one, they're too.
Can I see the book for him?
I see.
Oh, oh, oh, oh.
Um, they are like, this guy pops out and the other ones pop out and they appear to be like, having some territorial like match sort of thing happening.
Um, but when they, when they come out of the water, they see you guys in the corner of their eye and, um, they decide, at least it appears that they decide to set aside their different hole now to deal with the immediate threat of these interlopers.
The threat we're small and I should invite everybody to roll me some initiative.
I think it's three size categories bigger than me.
Okay.
That's true.
Great.
Um, so it's, um, roll a female 20.
It's going to say I could have more than two.
And your, I actually wouldn't want you to.
Yeah, yeah.
Five.
Yep.
And then your initiative.
There you go.
The combat section.
So it's at the bottom of the, is that spot on the page?
No, I just transferred it to you.
I did good.
And shift.
I did good.
I did good.
Well, well.
Well, it wasn't good at all.
So, I didn't think it was too long.
Oof.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Not what you want.
Brilliance.
That square case, Andy, stolen, like, confidential recipe for the pinwheels.
Oh, oh, oh.
They're so good.
So, is this actually a little bit of beach down there?
Pizza dough, pepperoni, mozzarella.
Correctly under the road.
It is.
It's basically, a whole order of those is basically a medium pizza.
Okay.
Okay.
I know.
The one day where I, oh, this is pizza.
And then I just ordered six of them instead.
No, it's not.
I don't remember.
They ordered something.
We sell a ton of those things.
Okay.
Okay.
So, we'll start off with Lil Jon.
You had Nate, right?
Yeah, right.
Yeah.
Um, that was the mother of all of the issues.
Girk.
18.
15.
Miseral.
16.
16.
Xander.
8.
8.
Jeser.
18.
18.
18.
Okay.
Got Mojo.
Okay.
Okay.
Do we get to decide?
Yeah.
Okay.
I don't care.
I didn't realize.
There's a lot of water to get your thing wet.
I know.
Are we not doing phrasing anymore?
We're not.
So, um, basically, kind of what, what you see.
As far as the overall layout here, there is a, there is a slight ledge here, but we're not
talking like 10 feet.
It's like more of like a five foot walkway.
So, it's not, it's not huge.
Um, very easy to jump.
Um, there are, of course, stairs down there.
Um, and, um, yeah, the rest of it's pretty much self-implanatory.
So, this is, this is a tide pool that goes out to the ocean, um, which is pretty heavily
inland.
Um, and that is something that, Jasper, you, you would have noticed.
Like, there's a period, there's, there appears to be a lot more water in here, um, in, in
this ward than there used to be.
Way more water than you would expect.
It's rising.
Yeah.
Way more water than you would expect from even the constant storms.
So, you know, the land is receding.
Oh, we're sinking, guys.
Um.
It's good.
Then, like, my thing will be always wet.
Okay.
We can fight under Underwater Campaign.
Let's go.
No one likes the Underwater Temple.
Let's go.
All right.
So, first things first.
I mean.
I don't like the thing that has, there's a monster that goes before us.
Yeah.
Yes, he does.
I don't like it.
Let's try to ruin all my fun.
Fun has been detected.
Okay.
So, this guy is going to go.
Five.
Ten.
Oh, good.
I don't have to move.
Phew.
Phew.
Phew.
Twenty.
Oh.
Twenty-five.
Oh, bullshit.
Phew.
30.
He's going to try to see if orc tastes like chicken.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
So, this giant frog monster just bounds through the water and then jumps up on top of the,
uh, on top of the ledge there and it, um, and then it tries to, uh, eat you.
No.
Did it, what, did it hop over that boat or did it, like, splinter the boat?
Oh, it just pulled through it.
Okay.
Um, and it's going to basically, it's going to have, it has, like, two barbed tentacles
and it whacks at you with both of them and then attempts to eat you.
I'm going to break my shades, but I'm going to tear out this test today.
I'm going to show you a little bit.
All right.
Now, what is your armor class?
It's, uh, uh, the AC is 14, right there.
Okay.
Um, so, both of the bite and one of the tentacles misses, but one of them is able to hit.
Uh, when it hits you, it kind of, um, it, it kind of latches onto you, dealing six points
of bludgeoning damage and nine points of piercing damage.
Um, look, and, uh, you are grappled right now, which means it's got you, it's, it's got
you under, uh, under a lock, but, um, yeah, I think it's current 28 and subtracted to subtracted
by 15.
Um, yeah, that is a, yeah, that's a huge hit and you are grappled, which means if you want
to move away from it, you have to succeed a DC 13 grapple check during your turn.
Um, well, my initial plan went out the window because that boat got destroyed, so we go with
plan B.
Uh, is it every other, if we're, nope, diagonal?
Nope, there is straight movement, five, five feet.
Tech, anything do I have to do with check?
Uh, no, you can.
Provoke an attack of opportunity.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna crouch down under this boat, um, under like the ledge of it, because
I'm pretty small, uh, and I'm going to aim at this guy, Kilis, well, okay, I can see
turning pretty easily, uh, and I'm just gonna go ahead and take a regular old shot at him.
Okay.
Um, yeah, it's just, uh, just a good old shot with my bombastic crossbow.
Uh, and that is gonna be a 22 to hit.
Oh, good.
Miss.
Yeah, I'm done with my bomb.
Uh, yeah, 22 hits in the AC of 14.
All right, 22 hits.
So, uh, uh, it is just a, maybe it is going to be, if I hit some, as he takes, uh,
that's pretty good.
That's pretty good.
14 points of fire damage.
Is it my crossbow bolt?
Shoots him in the hindquarters.
Uh, yeah, you, you are, you get it right in the, right in the tuchus.
It rears up.
Oh, hang on.
I have to add, I have to add my, because I, you do add your, your debts, right, in the,
in the magic weapon.
Yeah.
Uh, 18.
Ooh.
Okay, so that's an additional three?
Additional four.
Additional four is, I think, my hands, my magic weapon.
So it works.
All right.
Um, so the bolt sinks in pretty thoroughly, flares up with, with, um, fire as, you know,
the, it's, explodes on impact.
Um, the, um, the creature rears on its hind legs, but it happens to have an orc just hanging
around.
So it's just kind of like wave.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Every time I'm like crouching, my intent is to be stealthy, but I just can't hold it
in.
I just start laughing at him.
Yeah.
This is it.
Yeah.
All right.
And the thing I should do, and then there's the thing I'm going to do.
I don't know.
Oh, you're going to go off to the big bag.
Yeah.
I am.
I am.
You get to lightning fire thing.
I mean, so is this guy.
Oh yeah.
That's true.
Like what I should do is go over here and flank this guy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's not what we're going to do.
Yeah.
Oh, well, at least you acknowledge what I think to do when you choose to do the raw.
That's what, let me rephrase.
This is the smart thing to do.
Uh-huh.
This is where the big fatty is.
This is the skirk thing.
Yes.
Correct.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
There's like three people over there.
You're fine.
I got to make sure Jesric doesn't get eaten.
And we're going to, we're going to bonus action, dip my flail in all the convenient water.
Yep.
And we're going to recklessly attack.
Yeah.
I thought you were not raging first.
I only have one bonus action.
I know.
Oh, which one does the most damage.
Yeah.
The magic flail does more damage than the rage.
Oh, yeah.
And doesn't cost resources.
Yeah.
You don't have to get that.
Thank goodness for the advantage.
Uh-huh.
24.
24.
My four hits an AC of 12.
Excellent.
Oh.
Where'd she go?
It's big.
It's big.
Eight.
I'm going to need some of those.
Fire is kind of like lightning.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You.
Five.
Six.
Seven.
Plus seven is 14 points of damage.
14 points of damage.
Okay.
What is this thing that I'm.
What is this thing?
I'm trying.
It's.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's the giant merlot with tentacles.
Okay.
So, yep.
So, we just.
We go in.
We're swinging the flame.
We just kind of crack it across the mouth.
So, there's two frog things.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
And it's not three frog things.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I understand.
Yep.
Yeah.
All right.
So, you go in swinging hard.
Yeah.
Bonus action.
Dip it in the water.
Yep.
And then deal 14 points damage.
Yep.
All right.
All right.
Uh, that leaves Mistral.
Music is far too heroic for us getting ambushed by a murloc.
We didn't really get ambushed.
We stumbled upon them.
Yeah.
You guys have to get crushed.
We did not ambush them.
Wait a minute.
Who are you guys?
They're locked in this title pool with us.
I'm going to sneak up that backside over here and try and help.
A little down.
It was definitely a way.
Yeah.
You look at us.
Uh, so I am.
No.
I'm glad I didn't go first because I was going to hide in that boat that got destroyed.
I think I'm going to take a swing at him with my quarterstaff.
God, you're going to jump in.
Are you sure?
It sucks.
Oh, wait.
No, because I have.
Your hand wraps are mighty.
Yeah.
Your hand wraps are way more damage than your quarterstaff.
So, I'm going to be bonus action starved here really quickly.
Okay.
Yeah, we're going to swing in on them with the.
You can have mine.
So, can we think that's all I have.
Because, like, at the beginning of combat, it will take me a bonus action to rage.
It takes me a bonus action to dip my weapon.
Mm-hmm.
One of the things I get from my subclass is I can use my attack, my bonus action, to make another attack.
What's the best sequence of doing all that?
Yeah.
So, we're going to punch him with the thunderpid or those things.
Oh.
I would think it would be rage.
Because it's some rule of the 20.
Yeah.
Yeah, you will at least 20.
Damage reduction.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
At least with the.
And then.
Then you add your.
And then alternate dims from that section.
Like.
Like.
What's that?
I mean.
You have an extra.
I know.
That's what my.
Yeah.
It's like.
Yeah.
It's a six.
So.
Eight.
It's a six.
So.
Eight.
Or better.
We're completing the round to get the.
Yeah.
So.
What's your.
What's your.
What's your deck set?
All the math works out.
It's an eight.
Six.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So.
Okay.
And.
Yeah.
No.
You're.
You're.
You're right.
You're right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's like the.
You should have a nose around.
Officiality bonus.
It's on the.
Right.
Inside.
It should be.
Uh.
Two.
Okay.
So yeah.
Six.
Yeah.
What you got.
So.
Yeah.
You roll the 12.
You add six to it.
That's an 18.
Which totally does hit an AC of 14.
So.
You're.
You do hit.
Now your damage is.
Equal to.
Your unarmed.
Yes.
Okay.
Um.
Plus a dice.
Plus a d6.
Because of your hand wrap.
Uh.
D6 thunder damage.
So.
It's.
Whatever your.
Unarmed is.
Plus your d6.
Plus.
Plus.
Yeah.
Then you're going to add your decks.
And a plus one to that.
So.
We will add a four to that.
Five.
So.
I'm taking the top one.
Yep.
The top one.
So that's six.
And then.
Plus four is.
Ten.
Ten.
So you do ten points of damage.
To get them.
Sweet.
And keep in mind.
You do have a bonus action.
Now that you can.
Spin.
Technique points.
To flurry of blows.
And get two more attacks.
Also.
You have advantage.
So you can.
You.
So you roll twice.
Yeah.
Um.
When you attack.
And.
Yeah.
That's what I'm talking about.
So.
Okay.
So.
Minus.
Ten.
I.
Yeah.
I forgot to.
I forgot to tell you about the append.
Go ahead and roll another d20.
And see if you roll a 20.
Okay.
That is.
So.
So.
So.
You have a bonus action.
That you can spend.
Um.
Which.
Can.
Either.
Grant you.
Other things.
But in this context.
If you want to.
Get two more attacks.
With the flurry of blows.
And bring action.
Um.
Then it's one technique point.
And then you get two more attacks.
Um.
Or do you think it's not going to use it enough.
But get something to trade.
Yeah.
Um.
I'm.
Nah.
He's only two on this one.
Sorry.
Little John.
Get your own.
Well.
I think it was probably going to get.
I can bust me.
I got a board game.
I don't think it's him.
Well.
I only got two technique points.
And we still got the big dude.
If you're afraid to get.
You.
There are enough.
Sure.
All right.
Moving on.
It's.
Devictive.
I think.
I think we all know.
He's going to.
I'm going to run away.
Because he's scared of skirk.
Yep.
Scared of the dragon.
Yeah.
Yep.
He's never seen a water fire dragon before.
Uh-huh.
Might be.
Yep.
Basically an elemental dragon.
He just.
He's so scared.
He is going to.
Um.
Take.
Two tentacles.
Against you.
I have a reaction.
Okay.
He's got a reaction.
Friend.
Uh.
I'm fierce.
I'm small.
When a creature.
Large size or bigger.
Makes an attack against me.
I can make an attack.
As a reactive.
Ah.
Great.
Uh.
Eight of twelve.
You said.
Fuck.
No.
I'm good.
I'm good.
Okay.
Yeah.
That's an eight.
I get read numbers.
We're good.
Okay.
Okay.
Ten.
Eleven.
Seven is.
So we.
He.
Comes at me with one of his tentacles.
And I hook one of the tentacles with my flail.
And shock him again.
For.
Uh.
Seven.
Eighteen points of damage.
Damn.
Good.
All right.
Well.
I mean.
His attack still happens.
That I'm going to get got here.
But.
Well.
His first attack fails.
Yeah.
He gets fucked.
His second attack.
Okay.
What's your AC?
Seventeen.
Yep.
Second attack fails.
He should attack me more often.
I like that.
He even had advantage.
Oh no.
Yeah.
Because he would have recklessly attack me.
He's like.
Oh.
Four.
Six.
Two.
Oh.
Yeah.
Nice.
Yeah.
Well.
I mean.
At the end of the day.
If you want to be.
If you want to have somebody roll on terrible.
It's the GM.
Right.
All right.
Little John.
I have.
You have a thing that you need to do initially.
Because you start your turn right next to this thing.
This thing reeks.
It is the most disgusting.
Got that smell.
Smell that you've ever.
Ever smelled in your life.
I need a DC 15 con save.
Yes.
That's a harder DC than this disease.
Yes.
Vomit.
It's a.
So.
The D20 is.
That one.
Yep.
Sorry.
And then your con is.
Your con is.
Three is not going to get you to 16.
It's the heart one.
Um.
Yep.
So that's another three.
So that's six.
Which is not going to get you to 15.
It's one thing.
It's one thing.
Huzzah.
Maybe.
Um.
What happens.
Like.
Uh.
You are.
Um.
You are poisoned.
Oh.
Until the start of your next turn.
And.
Awesome.
What that means.
Um.
Is.
That.
Uh.
You have disadvantage on all attack.
Eh.
Ability checks.
For the rest.
Uh.
Uh.
Until the end of your turn.
Sorry.
Until the end of your next turn.
Yep.
Yep.
Yep.
Technically you are flanking him.
That is correct.
Okay.
Okay.
So you are currently in its tentacle.
You are.
Not.
Retching.
Because of this nasty.
Smell.
Um.
Bad fucking day guys.
Bad day when the ranged ranger ends up.
Right next to the big bad dickle bag.
Ah.
Hmm.
So.
You can't move away.
Unless you're able to escape.
Which is a DC.
13.
Reflex safe.
But that will take your action to do that.
So.
Um.
You can choose to stay.
And just attack it.
Like.
With your.
Very.
Weapon.
Bite it.
Or.
Um.
You can't.
Or with your.
Like with your axe.
Or you can.
Attempt to escape.
And.
Maybe get away.
From it.
But I would need a 13 on this die.
Yeah.
But not.
And you have disadvantage on it.
Which means.
You can roll twice.
And you can roll first of the two.
Okay.
All right.
I would technically need an 11 on that die.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good.
Because you're going to hold us.
Unless you have proficiency in your decks.
But.
He's a ranger.
So maybe.
An eye.
Okay.
What would disappear?
All right.
So he's rolling this thing.
Yep.
Yep.
Yep.
Good thing.
This is a couple.
Keep it.
Hello.
Good.
11.
11.
Was that an 11 on the die?
11 on the die.
Okay.
No.
That's the line.
Percentile.
So that's 16.
Which does.
Which will beat the 13.
But you have disadvantage.
So you need to roll again.
And hope that you don't roll worse.
Oh.
Were you attacking?
13.
13.
All right.
You are able to escape from his grasp.
And now you can feel free to move.
Where?
Good job, little gentleman.
Little John.
Little gentleman.
Run away.
You have a room.
You can come through the door.
That's true.
Are we saying as part of that action.
He disengaged.
Is that how it's working?
Yeah.
Okay.
Otherwise it's grappled again.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
That's what I'm assuming.
I just want to get.
Something's familiar.
That would be.
I'm assuming.
Exactly.
That would be extremely lengthy.
If that's the way that it works.
That's not the way.
Yeah.
Your whole action.
Try to do his.
You're going to get.
Oh.
Got him.
No.
No.
No.
All right.
So you're able to get up.
You do have a bonus action.
Which.
Really at this point.
So somebody.
You have a second fleet.
And an alarm.
Yeah.
Right.
At the same time.
Who would do that?
Who would do that?
It's ridiculous.
Yeah.
Use this.
And then.
As.
I'm going to be on a rebar.
I'm going to be on a period.
I'm going to be on three different party wanders.
Oh.
Scurry.
Yeah.
That's great.
Yeah.
No.
Absolutely.
Like.
Even.
Don't bomb.
Even if you did provoke.
Like.
You use your orc scurry.
To get out.
To bonus action.
Get out of the.
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Orc scurry.
Yeah.
Orc scurry.
Everywhere they scurry.
So you're.
You're a fool of me.
So you're.
Oh.
Yes.
Good.
Perfect.
I'm going to wonder.
Yeah.
Say the words.
Cleric.
Or two clerics say.
Yeah.
Trish blast.
Lady the Warlock's basically a cleric.
Say the words.
Here.
Okay.
I will raise my shield.
And say.
Yeah.
Raise my shield.
And call out.
May the wind and tides bless us.
The word is saying.
So this person.
We fall.
Actually.
You're in the water.
Now.
Like.
Some of the water comes out.
And like.
Goes around my shield.
And then disperses.
To.
Not everybody.
Because I can't do everybody.
Um.
I kind of like.
Mists on them.
I can't.
Actually.
It's not.
Actually going to get anything wet.
Unfortunately.
But.
You know.
I'm a lot of clerics.
Yeah.
It's good to water things.
Oh.
I love it when you mists on me.
How many people.
And I do.
Up to three.
That's.
Not very many.
Well.
Um.
Can you upcast?
We're gonna.
Uh.
I mean.
It's not worth it.
Yeah.
We're gonna get.
Uh.
Little John.
Or wait.
No we're not.
Uh.
We're gonna get Skirk.
Uh.
Vistral.
You attack.
Right.
Uh.
You gotta get Little John.
Maybe I get you.
You're right there though.
So don't.
I mean.
Mine might be.
Less relevant.
Just because I'm rolling with advantage every time.
I have that thought.
Like.
But I'm also.
Uh.
Saving throws.
Oh.
Okay.
Yeah.
That might matter more.
Yeah.
I'm starting melee with these.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I need to make saves.
So.
Sure.
That's why I'm kind of targeting the melees.
Sure.
So.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We'll hit.
We'll hit those three with bless.
Okay.
I'm melee.
All right.
So.
Wow.
You might wind up.
If you want to or not.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good.
Good form.
You'll lie faster.
Healthy.
Would you get wet?
Does your skin get even more translucent?
Like paper?
I get cold enough.
We're going to start with death call yet.
Um.
Oh.
And also as far as like the anchor is concerned.
I.
I think I've said this.
Before.
But if I.
If I have.
I apologize.
But.
The anchor just needs to get wet.
You don't specifically need.
Yes.
One talking.
So.
Yeah.
If other people.
Yeah.
If other people.
Like if the beastie.
All this action.
Like a guy can use.
If the beastie throws me in the water.
Or something.
Yeah.
If it just automatically.
Okay.
You did not.
You did not.
That's almost fine.
That doesn't mean.
Yeah.
Because my bonus action.
Is there like.
Yeah.
So.
You're like.
I'm fixing.
I'm just.
For what?
Yeah.
Every bonus action here.
I'm floating in you.
If the clerk never has anything to do.
You can just create water.
I can't use that action.
What?
It's not all.
It's a primal spell.
It's a primal spell.
It's not a divine spell.
Yeah.
It's a dom.
Oh no.
If you make fire.
It's kind of like water.
If you're.
An opposite of water.
Yeah.
If you're really nice to the ranger.
He's got.
Oh.
So.
Maybe.
He could.
He could use.
Create water.
I mean.
I think.
I think he's a little busy at the moment.
You gotta be.
You gotta be friendly to him.
I'm sure he won't just do it just because.
All right.
So this guy is.
Five.
Ten.
Fifteen.
Twenty.
Twenty.
Twenty.
He just blew your cover.
Oh.
I think the boat that you were hiding under just exploded.
Fine.
It's fine.
So we've got.
One tentacle for you.
One tentacle for you.
Oh yeah.
I am out of reaction.
Recklessly attack.
I am out of reactions unfortunately.
Use my reaction.
Can I use your reaction?
I would love it.
Use my reaction.
Be happy.
All right.
So.
Yes.
I did recklessly attack.
Okay.
The tentacle is a.
He rolled a 19.
So he definitely.
Oh yeah.
That'll hit.
Well.
Um.
Funny now that he knows my C.
That he.
That.
Six.
Um.
It.
It does.
Um.
Fifteen points.
No.
Image.
Oh.
Six of that is bludgeoning.
Son of a.
Nine of that is piercing.
Son of a bitch.
Almost.
Oh wait.
I had already taken damage.
And you had someone.
No.
You couldn't use that.
Yeah.
I was only missing seven.
I'm not going to even hit that.
When I hit that is a D12.
Of course.
This one's going after you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Learning is a curve.
We won by experience.
Fuck.
The gnome was right.
Yeah.
Uh.
I rolled a six.
So.
D12 will not hit your 16.
Perfect.
You.
Successfully get out.
Uh.
But.
I will try and bite you.
Okay.
That seems tasty.
And he'll.
Roll a three.
And.
What do you get?
Apparently the only thing that I can hit is.
Is the cobble over there.
You hit me once out of three times.
I wouldn't say.
I can.
I can.
That's.
That's a two.
Well.
You can be a feeling.
Pulls a great GM deficit.
Fire.
It's a great GM.
Do I have a.
I got a four.
But my boat is actually.
You're talking about.
Yeah.
I know.
That's a two.
All right.
So we.
We have.
We're starting the round.
Misrule.
You are.
Right next to this guy.
And so.
He is going to.
Unleash his.
Holy.
Oh no.
Right.
Oh man.
He's going to.
He's going to.
Hit you.
Attempt to hit you with two tentacles.
And a bite.
Like.
Maybe.
This is like.
I'm done with this game.
It's TPK time.
Before they get to the pirates.
I didn't prep enough.
We got to kill them.
Oh hey.
It's good TPK with the pirates.
There's 40 of them.
Okay.
So.
Pirates unfortunately will not be large.
Oh maybe there's a big pirate.
Jason what's your AC?
16.
You think we get to fight man's leaf?
So.
He misses with one of his.
Tentacles.
No.
But hits with the other.
And he crits with his.
What?
Ow.
Oh.
That's probably not the one he wanted to cring us.
That seems.
Less than ideal.
Okay.
Okay.
So.
Every part.
Right.
Yeah.
So.
Flaming hands.
The tentacle.
It hits you.
It does 15 points of damage.
Flesh and piercing.
So.
In your.
In your points section.
You.
Basically.
Just subtract 15 from it.
So.
Jump down to 12.
Yeah.
Wolf.
Spicy.
And it's.
I'm going to roll the bite.
Because.
I can't just double damage on a crit.
And it's actually.
Can't double average damage on a crit.
Yeah.
That's cool.
That's a lot of dice.
Okay.
Oh.
Wrong ones.
You're getting bigger ones?
Getting bigger ones.
That's not great.
You're getting great.
You're getting cool ones on all of them.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Oh.
4d8.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a 2d8 attack.
Yeah.
No.
No.
It's a crit.
6.
10.
Remember.
When you go to zero.
You're not dead.
Oh.
That is.
Yeah.
So.
10 to 17.
19.
22.
Jesus.
All right.
Are you.
Are you.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
I was only at 12.
You took the 12 with the tentacles.
Okay.
So.
You're not dead.
You just fall unconscious.
Yeah.
What this means is.
One of your.
One of your allies.
Can.
Can either.
Give you a potion.
Which will bring you up.
Which will bring you.
Like.
The words.
Cleric.
Or the cleric can.
Or the cleric can heal you.
Which will bring you back up.
So.
It's not the end of the world.
You aren't dead dead.
No.
No words.
Just for.
It is often.
The most efficient.
To not heal someone.
Until they have fallen down.
Initiative.
In this game.
If you are.
Unconscious.
Like.
And it passes your turn.
Do you have to wait.
All the way back to your turn.
Or would you go at the end.
I'm pretty sure that you.
Like.
This is one of those areas.
Where it would follow D&D.
So.
Okay.
It would just be.
I'll make this just.
Say.
If you're on his turn.
Yeah.
I'll make your.
Okay.
Yeah.
Cool.
Yep.
All right.
Would this be a spot.
Where my.
Good berries would be.
He's got good berries.
He does have good berries.
So.
Somebody can suffer.
Yeah.
This.
This would.
Like.
If somebody.
Took one of your good berries.
And shoved it down your throat.
Then you would get one.
Don't wait.
And become.
Conscious.
So.
Gotcha.
All you need to have is one hit point.
Yep.
To be awake.
To be active.
Yep.
So.
So.
So.
Like.
If somebody wanted to.
Assist you.
They could do that.
And.
Jezric.
You were.
Yeah.
I will make my console.
DC 15.
15.
Uh.
I will not make my console.
Oh no.
You are sickened.
Did you have four?
I did.
Okay.
Actually.
Let me.
It's 15.
Is it sickened or poisoned?
No.
Uh.
Poisoned.
Sorry.
Sickened is the wrong game.
Well.
Sorry.
No.
I am one off.
Well.
Justice.
Do you have luck?
Oh.
I do have luck.
I'm going to pass.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm going to spend this luck to.
Plus one me.
All right.
All right.
So I am not sickened.
You're not.
Um.
You held it in.
I did.
You like my head.
Oh.
I'm okay.
Well.
Kirk's a sympathetic vomiter.
Oh no.
You had a little bit of the dry.
Please.
Yeah.
It's just not sickened.
Is this guy.
That we've been beaten up on.
As a group.
Is he looking bad?
Uh.
The little just.
Had a turd.
Right.
All the last until the end of his turd.
Correct.
Uh.
Yeah.
It lasts.
Until the beginning of his next turn.
Oh.
Oh.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So that functionally is.
Is he looking.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's what we need to say.
Between.
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
From which.
In this.
I don't think.
Any of you.
What was the question?
Is he looking healthy still?
The guy that we've been beaten up on?
Um.
He's looking.
Not.
The.
The.
He's looking mildly annoyed.
Mm.
Yeah.
So he's looking.
Injured.
Okay.
But the big.
The big big guy.
Is looking badly injured.
Okay.
Bad guy.
Perfect.
Because what I know.
If you steal my kill.
Because I'm going to.
Stand up.
And steal.
Kirk.
You bastard.
I'm going to try.
Oh.
You fail.
Uh.
So that is going to be.
Six plus eight.
So.
It was.
Well.
So you're.
It's going to hit.
Uh.
Spawn.
This way.
That is going to be.
Uh.
Fourteen.
Fifteen.
Sixteen.
Seventeen.
Eighteen.
Points.
Nice.
The flame damage.
All right.
Um.
How do you want to do this?
Sorry.
Perfect.
So what I'm going to do.
Uh.
I'm going to hear this thing.
Scream out.
As Skirk's.
Like.
Lightning strikes it.
With his.
With his flail.
Mm-hmm.
Because I'm still crouched down.
Behind this thing.
I couldn't really see.
Right.
Uh.
I'm going to stand up.
I'm going to look.
I'm going to see.
He's down.
That.
Turn around.
Shoot at it.
And my.
My arrow.
Hits it.
Like right in the arm.
Mm-hmm.
And then.
Uh.
Explodes.
As like.
You know.
Armed viscera.
Goes away.
And.
And arm falls into the water.
Um.
Mm-hmm.
And.
Um.
My movement.
Um.
I'm going to move.
Over.
Besides Skirk.
And.
I'm going to take.
My water flask.
And use my bonus action.
And.
Throw some more water on it.
I don't know if it.
Right.
That's it or not.
But.
If.
It will react.
Okay.
Perfect.
That is my bonus action.
Yeah.
Okay.
Uh.
This.
This creature falls into the water.
Kind of slow motion.
It's tentacles being the last thing that you see.
But.
Eventually.
They.
Kind of.
Stop.
And.
Just.
Sink into the waves.
Along with it.
Um.
That's the good stuff Skirk.
That's the good stuff Skirk.
Skirk.
You are up.
Please roll me a constitution saving throw.
Yeah.
Here you go to these.
I really want to have an extra d4.
Oh.
10.
Plus 4 is 14.
Oh no.
You have a lot.
I do not.
No one.
Well you do now.
Here you go.
I do not have a force Skirk.
No.
You are.
Poison.
What does it do?
What does that do?
Disadvantage on attack rolls and.
And ability.
I have advantage anyway.
It's fine.
And it's roll straight now.
That's fine.
Yeah.
If I go back here.
Do I have double advantage?
That's not how the force.
They are.
In fact.
I had to try.
All right.
Uh.
We're just gonna.
Swing at this guy.
And shoot.
Uh.
Jezric.
A dirty look.
What's the thing?
It's all.
Kill secure.
Kill secure.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
This.
This advantage doesn't matter.
If you can't roll the one of seven.
Ha ha ha.
I am not kidding.
That's definitely.
All of the seven.
D4.
I mean what.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
I got the D4.
What do I need to hit?
Just out of curiosity.
Uh.
These guys.
14.
I'd miss.
Okay.
Well.
I need another luck point though.
Yep.
Yep.
Yep.
Not a long turn.
Yeah.
We're just.
We're building up a lot.
We're taking a.
We're taking a set up turn.
Did you rage?
Oh yeah.
Bonus action.
I rage.
Rebuilding.
Yes.
I said.
We're going to rebuild the base.
Okay.
I hit them.
I hit them from myself.
I definitely did rage.
You just need a new offensive approach.
I mean.
Yeah.
There you go.
Go.
All right.
Um.
And then.
Hold on.
I'm trying to think if I have a move.
If you move.
Evoke a reaction.
Then you can attack it again.
No.
Because I think it's only when it attacked.
That's a.
That's a great question though.
There's a thought.
Okay.
While he's working that out.
Well.
Um.
We'll move on to.
Misro.
Hold on.
I mean.
You're in front of me.
Darian.
That's ridiculous.
And I long.
So.
Jason.
As.
Misro is unconscious.
Um.
Right now.
The only thing that you can do is.
Try and make a death save.
What that is.
Is you take a d20.
When you roll it.
And if you roll above a 10.
You succeed.
If you roll.
Above a 10.
You've got larger.
You can see within five feet.
13.
So you.
You can use your reaction.
To attack.
Um.
Really?
Right.
Okay.
Uh.
There is a.
Separate.
I got.
See.
Connection.
Yep.
It's not positive.
I'm not.
So.
If you acknowledge.
You succeed.
Yeah.
Then you.
You just need.
Allow.
Like check the bubble.
That is.
On the positive.
Once you get three successful saves.
You.
Become stabilized.
Oh.
And you're.
No longer.
In.
Danger of dying.
However.
If you get three failures.
You're dead dead.
Okay.
If you roll a one.
You get two failures.
If you roll a.
Twenty.
You get.
Two successes.
So.
There's always a risk.
All right.
You know.
You might.
Nobody else.
Nobody ever.
Nobody else.
Nobody else.
No.
Never.
No.
Nobody's actually.
Killed their character.
A lot of times.
By just being a second saving.
And they break.
Nobody killed their character.
That was like.
Fifteen years old.
I've never seen it.
I just don't know what's going on with that.
Okay.
I do have my thing sorted.
Okay.
Yeah.
So.
Yes.
After Skirk misses this.
The giant.
The frog thing.
He's like.
Oh.
Jesric's got this one.
He killed the other one.
He'll be fine.
We're going to eat ourselves.
Jesric is going to be fine.
Jesric will be fine.
So we're going to eat ourselves over here.
Okay.
You do provoke.
It will attack.
Yep.
It can make its attack.
If I am alive at the end of the attack.
Then I get.
Because it happens first.
And then I get my reaction.
Yeah.
And you're recklessly attacking right.
So he does get.
He.
He has recklessly attacked.
Yep.
Yep.
All right.
So.
That is a.
Nineteen to hit.
Double hit.
So you will.
You will take fifteen points of damage.
It's just static damage.
It's average damage.
Well.
Good thing I have damage resistance.
So it's.
He's a lot of damage.
Yeah.
So it's.
Which way do I round?
I take seven or eight.
If it's DMV.
It's Dally.
Two hit points left.
That's a lot.
Great.
That's all we need.
I got the last one.
I got one.
I got one.
Three hit points.
You know.
And so we're going to make the attack back at it.
Okay.
Okay.
You are.
You are poisoned.
So.
Oh yeah.
Don't forget your D4 though.
Yeah.
So.
How do I.
Do this.
Because I rolled two dice.
But I shouldn't have actually rolled two dice.
Oh.
Just.
Just rainbow.
Just rainbow.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Plus the D4.
Ten.
Plus that'll hit.
Seventeen.
Yeah.
Yep.
That's a D8.
Plus two for my rage.
What a shitty roll.
Seven.
Eight.
Fifteen.
Sixteen.
Seventeen points of damage.
Even with a shitty roll.
Yeah.
This guy is falling on the injured side of things.
Injured is about halfway.
Yep.
Yep.
Yep.
So.
Next up.
Lil Jon.
Yeah.
What.
What.
What.
What.
What.
What.
What.
What.
What.
What.
What.
What.
What.
What.
What.
What.
What.
What.
What.
That is.
That will.
Allow you to.
Roll.
I think it's 1d8.
Plus your.
Feel casting warfare.
So it'd be 1d8.
Plus wisdom.
And then you would recover that many heads.
Or whoever you target.
Or whoever.
I think it is touch.
It is touch.
It is touch.
So you would have to be right next to him.
So if you're going for this roll,
you would have to be standing right.
I can't do it to myself.
It's for my...
You can do it to yourself.
But it would be your action.
Yeah.
Okay.
So if I win that, what would I do?
So if you wanted to do that...
You just say you cast a spell,
you mark off your spell slot,
and then you roll the D8,
and then add your wisdom to it,
and you heal that much.
In general, at this point,
since you are out of the line of fire,
these things are both melee creatures.
So chances of them actually making it over to you
and attacking you are crazy low.
So we're going to need one of those here in a moment.
We don't get to skip the long run.
All right.
I expect my creatures of archery.
Yep.
Yeah.
So your aim gives you a plus two.
So you would have...
If you look at your longbow,
your bonus is plus five.
So your aim would add a plus two to that.
So you've got plus seven to your D20 goal.
Yeah.
That's a D12.
The D20 is the one that looks exactly like it,
only smaller sites.
All right.
12.
Yeah.
Okay.
And 12 plus seven, right?
So that would be 19,
which will hit DC...
Which will hit the AC of 14.
So now you're rolling damage.
So this is where you need to make a decision.
You have the Mystic Mark ability.
You can only do it twice a day.
However, it's likely just metagaming.
It's likely that this is going to be one of your only combats
between this and your next long run.
So you probably want to use your Mystic Mark,
which will add a D4 to your damage.
So what your damage is going to look like here,
because you've got the Hunter,
you've got the Mystic Mark up,
and you've got your regular attack,
is you'll be rolling the one D8
and two D4 for damage.
So the D8 is the static.
Yeah, like twice.
Yeah.
So you roll the D8 once,
and then you roll the D4 twice,
and then add that all together.
That one is a...
five.
Okay.
And this one twice?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It is on the bottom, right?
Three?
Okay.
Yep.
That looks like three.
You did four.
Oh, really?
Okay, so you had five plus three,
eight plus four,
12,
and then you add plus five to that,
because that's your dexterity
plus your Bracers of Archery.
So...
17.
17?
17?
Right.
12 plus five is 17.
Yes.
All right, cool.
So you do 17 points of damage.
Nice.
Get on.
Which is just,
just for the record,
at this level is...
Pretty bonkers.
Very good damage.
Very good damage.
So...
Minus 17.
All right.
And you're shooting that guy, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
That guy's got to be pretty close to the gicked.
He's badly injured.
Right.
So he's...
He's pretty close.
He's being poisoned.
What did that do?
Oh, you are not poisoned anymore.
You are no longer poisoned.
It refreshed at the beginning of the bear.
So...
You don't have to worry about that anymore.
All right.
Now...
Mm-hmm.
That was a good...
That was...
That was some...
Oh, solid.
That was a good round.
Good round.
All right.
Xander.
All right.
You're up on Xander.
Xander.
Step one.
We cast...
Steam a bolt.
Fire bolt.
But...
We're gonna...
Steam this guy.
Okay.
Steam a frog.
Frog legs.
So tasty.
All right.
Seven.
Oh, that's a crit.
Get him.
Okay.
I see.
Just those dice, right?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, it's almost dice.
Yeah.
Let's get the...
I always forget that fire bolt requires an attack roll.
Yeah.
A lot of saves.
Yeah.
Oh, well...
Garbage.
All right.
So, altogether, that is 14 points of damage.
Okay.
I can't triple, I'll frickin' take.
Yeah.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You...
You...
You aren't able to hit it.
It's...
Skin starts boiling and boiling up in the area where the steam hit.
Oh, wow.
One might refer...
One might call it...
Say that it is near death.
Oh, that's unfortunate.
Well...
All right.
Uh, then, step two, uh, bonus action.
Uh, we're gonna, uh, uh, hold the shield aloft, um, and, uh, I will say, uh, forgive me,
friend, but we still need you here.
Um, and I will cast Huey Word, and, like, moodlight shines down on Mistral.
Uh, and Mistral, we will heal for...
Pretty good.
Uh, eight.
Good.
Eight health back.
And you are...
No longer dying.
So you are officially...
Conscious.
So.
Just in time.
Monster attacks again!
And how many points are killing potion work?
Uh, uh...
D4 plus two.
2D4 plus two.
2D4 plus two.
Is what I have written.
Yeah, so I wrote it down to...
Because it's different in every game I play.
So if he moves towards me, I can give him a potion, and that would check him to, uh...
I can't...
I can't...
A free...
Hold on a day.
Once a day.
Oh, that's pretty cool.
All right.
So, uh...
And what...
Cool.
What would that...
This average field of allies spell?
As it turns out, being a half-long...
I didn't...
Why are you wearing a gnome?
A gnome.
Oh, small book.
Oh.
You get a book?
Yes.
Once a day.
You just get a book?
Yeah.
I'll verify with a book, but I'm gonna...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That is what I have wrote down under a feature in the trick.
Hold on.
I gotta write down a feature.
Wait.
Wait.
What?
What?
Resolve.
What?
What is it?
Right there.
I don't need to...
I don't need to verify with a book.
I don't know how to read it.
Yes.
I don't need to...
Yes.
The big...
The big bad diggle bad...
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Attacks you.
Yep.
For...
Ow.
It's best...
Attack...
It is...
16.
Ah, 16 hit.
16 would normally hit.
But in this case, I have a reaction.
Okay.
I'm gonna use one of my spell slots to cast a shield.
Yeah.
Nothing hits you.
I do roll my shield.
Wait.
Do you got spell slots?
I have...
Yes.
I have...
I can cast it up to four times a day.
Oh.
But it uses one of my inspiration...
One of my...
My...
Motes of inspiration.
Okay.
Okay.
I didn't put too much.
That character's doing things wrong.
What's happening over on this side of my favorite creature?
I have an idea.
You don't get it.
No.
No.
Oh.
It's an idea.
I cast...
I cast...
I do have a number of my favorite fans.
Ah.
Okay.
We have four of them, so...
For long.
Yep.
So this guy...
He...
Isn't quite aware that Mistral is conscious at this point,
Because he hasn't been moving.
So he's gonna be attacking...
The only other guy that's right next to him.
Sadly, I have already used my reaction to him.
That's fine.
Okay.
Um...
Well, I'm pretty sure that...
A 20 will hit.
Seems likely.
I need an idea.
Yeah.
I can't cast shield on other people, though.
Oh, well.
But I guess I'm gonna get hit.
All right.
And that will be enough to drop you unconscious, I believe.
If it's average, then...
Yeah.
Unless average is...
Even...
Even less than four.
Even if it wasn't average, it would still...
Yes, I am...
Skirk is unconscious.
If he rolled a...
If he rolled a one,
He would still be having four points damage.
Yes.
The damage bonus alone.
Yep.
Yep.
I got got.
Okay.
That's fine.
It was awesome.
Okay.
On the bright side, you are no longer voiceless.
And I don't have to make a save away,
and I do a...
It's just a different...
You're a different...
You do a different...
Yeah.
You're gonna be four.
I'm not sure.
Oh.
All right.
I'm sure.
Um...
I don't know.
Jasric, you were up.
Alrighty.
Uh...
So, Jasric, he was gonna...
Well, he's gonna make Kansai first.
That's what he's gonna do.
Oh, yeah.
I don't know.
Is that correct?
Jasric is gonna make Kansai first.
Jasric, six, nine, and eleven, twelve.
Sorry.
Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen.
Only thirteen.
I have two luck points.
Fifteen's the number.
Fourteen's the number.
Fourteen's the number.
Fourteen's the number.
Yeah.
Okay.
I wish I could spend...
I wish you could spend luck points to add your armor class temporarily.
That'd be dope.
Um, so...
That would be cool.
I don't have a guy right next to me.
They should love that.
I mean, it makes sense.
Luck.
Right.
Yeah.
Um, if I am shooting a ranged weapon in melee, is that gonna affect, like, disadvantage or something on top of me?
It is disadvantage.
Well, I'm not gonna do that, so, uh...
Um, well, if you're shooting into melee, yes.
If you're shooting from melee, I believe it's just a raidable.
Yeah, okay.
So, if you're attacking the guy that's right next to you...
Yeah, I believe that's sort of...
Okay.
I will not do that, because I don't want to miss.
Yeah.
Um, so, I will attack the guy that is killing my friends!
Okay.
Uh, that is gonna be an 11 plus my 8, which is 19.
Okay.
Alright.
Let's see.
8, uh...
12 points of fire damage.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, man.
You are so close.
No, no!
No!
So close.
If you come double potion out of my throat, I can kill it out of my turn!
Don't do that.
That'd be really stupid.
You would get gotcha.
That's a very bad idea.
Well, he does...
Well, no.
If he wants to...
He just...
Sorry to his turn, so shield doesn't apply.
Yeah, shield is gone, in fact.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
But...
One never said...
Risks...
Oh, no.
I'm just trying to...
Oh, no.
I'm going to do.
So I get there.
You're the most foolhardy party I have ever seen.
You're a hit.
No!
Yes.
Do these things have reach?
I thought we saw them attack 10 feet away earlier.
If we did, that wasn't...
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm pretty sure...
Otherwise...
Yeah, if they did have reach, they could just...
Right, right.
You wouldn't...
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right.
You are a tenant.
All right.
You take 15 points damage, and you are, in fact, grappled.
No, we tried.
Why did it auto-hit you?
Well, he hit...
Oh, he rolled.
Oh, I rolled.
I missed the roll.
I rolled an 18.
Oh, okay.
That'll get you.
24, which...
You've got to see shield that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's not going to hit them.
That's it.
All right.
We tried.
Yep.
All right.
I will make my death saving throw.
All right.
I'll make my first death saving throw.
All right.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Congratulations.
All right, Mistral.
Can't die next turn now.
Oh, and you are...
I'm in the water.
You know when I wake up, my flame will be electrified.
That's true.
Bastard!
You...
You clock!
Let your hand make out!
Oh, my God.
All right.
I'm going to swing on this guy.
Yep.
Oh, ho.
With my little hand-wrapped thingy-majigars.
All right.
Yep.
Yep.
So roll that d20.
Yep.
And you...
Oh, jeez.
Well, it's not going to matter there.
But you are blessed.
You get to add a d4 on all your attacks.
Yeah.
But...
Which...
Seven?
I mean, that might matter.
Oh, yeah, maybe.
You said a d4.
Yeah, that's true.
You're plus seven.
Three.
So that's six.
Plus seven is 13.
He does one.
Yeah.
I think it's 14, 13.
Yeah, that's one short.
Yep.
Deluxe.
Deluxe.
Do you wish to...
Flurry of Blows?
Yeah.
Flurry of Blows would probably kill it.
Nope.
That's a d20.
And you still get your bless on that, too.
Yep.
So you get that plug.
You get that.
Oh, man.
There's a four.
One better.
There you go.
That'll handle it.
Yep.
And...
Something...
A d...
A d4 and a d6.
I don't have a couch.
A d gloves.
And the d6.
And the d6.
Yeah.
You did give it away, Dave.
Holy cow.
I did give it away.
I'm lying on the ground dying.
That's three.
So three is a seven.
And I didn't even get to kill a thing.
Okay.
So that's...
Yeah.
I don't care for tonight.
I don't care for tonight.
You're Dax's stuff.
What's to see?
I don't care for that.
From the hand rhythms.
So, yeah.
That is...
I think I'm just going to run over here to see my...
That's just...
That's just fun punch, right?
That is fun punch.
I'm surprised.
Jason.
But wait.
It had seven hit points left.
Oh, fuck.
You did seven points of damage.
Yep.
There we go.
How do you want to have killed it with it just barely having died?
This is the...
This was the...
The frog-looking thing, right?
Yep.
I think I'm just going to go with an old-fashioned uppercut.
All right.
So you...
Yeah.
You do an uppercut to it.
It...
Hi, buddy.
Its feet just kind of barely lift, but it...
Looks at you confused for a second, and then...
Falls over.
Multimulus.
Yeah.
Got it.
And next up, we have Lil Jon.
I'm believing you when I wake up.
Yeah, it's not better, man.
I think I'm going to think that you're going to kill.
The next up...
Is dragon friend.
Oh, oh, oh.
All right.
Then we've got...
Cool.
We can do the...
Okay.
The spell cure wound.
Okay.
Right.
Yep.
So, mark off on the spell slots.
Put one next to that to represent you spending one spell slot.
Roll a D8, which is that kind.
This work?
Yeah.
Okay.
And then add your wisdom modifier to that.
Two.
Two.
Plus...
If you flip over, your wisdom is the owl up top.
Your wisdom modifier is the plus.
So, it's plus two.
So, you heal four points of damage to Skirk.
Yeah.
Switch back up.
Skirk is...
A lake.
All right.
And how long did the potion work?
2D4.
Plus two.
Give him a potion.
Oh, shoot, man.
Go get him all.
All the way up.
Yeah.
Get him back all the way up.
Yeah.
So, yeah.
There's your D4.
So, roll that twice.
And then just add two to that.
Three, two.
All right.
I'm going to roll it again.
One.
Okay.
So, that's three plus two, five.
Yep.
So, four plus five is nine.
Nine.
Yeah.
So, you're up by nine.
Okay.
All right.
Then I'm going to...
All right.
So, I can still attack this thing.
No.
You use your action to...
But, I mean, that is...
Oh, that is a...
That's very, really good.
I do not think about that when the bonus action potions...
Yeah, yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Do a full heal plus bonus action.
Yeah, yeah.
That's pretty awesome.
Oh, oh.
Mm-hmm.
Speaking of bonus action potions that are healed.
Yeah.
Alexander.
Oh, so just this one dude left, right?
Don't feel that.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, is this thing walking?
It looks injured.
Okay.
All right.
All right.
It's not...
It's not very heavily injured.
All of us also look injured.
Yeah, I was going to say...
All of us...
I was a Jesuit walk.
Injured.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
All right.
Solidly injured.
Trying to decide...
Not solidly injured.
Just slightly injured.
I am paper-thin injured.
I'm...
Better than half.
You know what's up?
Got more than half my health.
I'm totally injured.
Got more than half my health left.
Okay.
All right.
All right.
Well...
Uh...
You know...
I thought I was going to do it.
It doesn't have to make sense.
I'm glad you do something.
It's going to make no sense.
It might make no sense.
I agree.
It doesn't have to make sense.
We're going to do it.
Because I want to...
Right.
I mean...
When you fall...
When you get knocked down when you're raged...
Yeah.
You get up and you're very disoriented.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, yeah.
And...
Whatever's near you...
Sure.
There's more near you.
Uh-huh.
And Jezra...
But he's kind of floating in the air for a moment.
So that's what you got to do?
Mm-hmm.
Well...
I didn't...
I didn't...
I said people were going to be mad, but...
Fine.
God, Xander's going to kill him, man.
I will knock him...
Watch the crazy game.
Are you playing your character?
You're being a bulldog.
Is there such a thing?
I don't know, Jezra.
And if you have to justify...
You're acting by it, going...
It's what my character would do.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm sure everything will turn out.
Cool.
So, Xander raises the shield, kind of...
What time of day is it, Chris?
It is...
Time...
Midday.
Okay.
Time...
But, like, kind of catch and absorb some of the sun's rays.
And from the shield...
Now, this time, not Steven, just straight up.
Three rays of fire shoot out of the fuel.
That's it.
And I'm casting a scorching ray.
It is...
These things are 14?
14, yeah.
Alright.
Well, that hits.
That hits.
And that hits.
Sick.
Yeah.
I think you got it.
Rays of scorching.
I'm not going to kill it, I'm sure, but...
A lot of nights.
More.
Not great.
There's a six.
There's a lot of clues.
16.
I only saw a six.
21.
21.
Very good.
Very good.
Damage.
Okay.
It is not badly injured.
Excellent.
Yep, that's me.
That's all I got.
Now, it's...
It's turn.
Yes.
A tasty gnome snack.
It does have a tasty gnome snack.
It does, but it also just saw you dispatch the rest of the group.
So, it is going to choose Prudence over Valor.
Oh, what the way.
It was looking for a tasty snack.
You guys are not...
You guys are not as easy of kills.
What's up, right?
What's up, right?
So, he is going to...
What are you trying to do, buddy?
Drop the gnome and run.
That's right.
You better.
What are you trying to do?
And he disappears into the books.
Hmm.
I'm going to be some attentions.
You certainly can punch it if you want to.
I would like to try.
I hope you have to kill it.
Hit it in the butt as it runs away.
Roll a 20.
It drops you, and in mid-air, you just drop kick it.
I do not have a melee weapon, so it is just...
It is just a fist or a foot.
Yeah.
You doing okay, bud?
That is a two.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, thank you.
Bless you.
Four.
Six.
Don't you want me to see me?
I don't know.
Six, six, six.
Six, six.
That's a definite name.
I get it.
I get it.
All right.
Howard!
Don't you try to try anything, love?
We do have...
Two, better.
Steamed and...
Not charred.
That's what I'm looking for.
No, it's charred.
Oh, charred isn't tasty.
Oh, braised.
Braised, yeah.
Lightning damage would braise, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Steamed and seared.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
There you go.
Okay, so you guys are able to...
You defeated two of the monsters, and the third one fled into the tide pool.
Oh, ho.
And you are left with this sense of foreboding that really hasn't ever gone away since you walked into this board.
Oh, ho.
Oh, ho.
Oh, ho.
Oh, ho.
Oh, ho.
Oh, ho.
Oh, ho.
Does anybody have any initial things that they want to do in reaction to the combat before we proceed further into just making it to the nest?
When Skirk wakes up, he is, like, super disoriented and still, like, fell down in the battle, was enraged, like, wakes up still mad and going and, like, lashes out with his flail and starts to swing at whoever's right in front of him and, like, catches himself just in time.
And he's like...
And puts his foot, like...
And tries to pretend like he didn't do it.
Someone's like me when you wake him up from a man.
Yes.
Almost get punched in the face.
So, Lil Jon, you see a side of Skirk that you don't really prefer to see in the future.
He's a really small guy, but big scary.
Lots of anger.
Um, all right.
Um, yeah, so the aftermath, um, I'm going to ritually cast my second-level ritual spell, Prayer of Healing.
That seems good.
Um, so it takes ten minutes.
Um, I'll just kind of, uh, take my will incorporate that.
Um, just have a little ritual, gather everybody around, um, and, um, what I'm going to say for this ritual...
Okay, everybody, hold hands.
...is, uh, I'm going to take out, uh, that, like, notebook journal that I had.
Um, and you find that it is, um, some combination of letters...
...letters and, like, memories of his family.
...and he just kind of, like, allowed to read through some of that.
Um, and everyone is going to heal.
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
Where's your max still?
...
...
...
...
I'm going to use a hit die, right?
Yeah, yeah, because what it does...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
I'm going to, uh, just, out of curiosity...
...
...
...
...
that I'm not going to find anything, so I'm not going to live too hard.
Okay.
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
...
Go ahead and roll me a DC 15 perception.
Could I perhaps convince you of investigation?
I'm taking some time to look around.
Bust him a gate.
I'll allow it.
I'll allow it.
I succeed at the investigation.
I roll a 18.
Well, you don't see anything that would be specific to...
monsters, but you do have to cross something that is specific to fish.
So you see something shiny just off of the dock right there.
And you go down there and do a quick dive.
And there's not like super deep.
Um, but there's a small, there's a small chest of gold.
Yeah.
So if you can figure out a way of getting it up.
What?
It's gold.
Gold.
Where?
For water.
You gotta drag it up.
You got an anchor?
Yeah, we can do that.
Okay, so you use your anchor to fish for gold.
Mm-hmm.
Um, you...
I fashion fishing tools out of my anchor using my tinkering tools.
Okay.
Between, between your tinkering tools and...
Like, we've got like three people that are like maker style people.
If you can't make a fishing pole.
We can't figure out a way of getting something left up here.
We got some real big problems.
So, uh, you guys fashion in some way of being able to kind of hoist the, uh, uh, hoist the,
the chest out of the water.
Mm-hmm.
In, inside there, uh, you see...
3,000 gold.
That's rich.
Split six ways, that makes it 560.
1,250.
1,000 gold.
I just tried to...
That didn't work well, Dave.
So, the chest itself...
I guess I misrepresented small chest.
It was big enough to...
And to gain the eye of these fish creatures.
Yep.
Um, so it's...
It's pretty sizable.
It's sizable.
It's definitely something that's got.
Three, that's a little bit.
How heavy is it?
It's pretty...
The chest or the coal?
The chest.
Um, I mean, it's, it's made, it's like oak and iron.
So, it's a pretty heavy one.
All right.
My question is...
Yeah.
That was exactly what I was going to do.
Like, with my strength of 18, can Skirk use it as a backpack?
Absolutely.
Don't.
Yeah.
I mean, if you're...
It's as big as you are.
Yeah.
I have to use, like, a mode of creation to make it foldable.
Ah, and I fold up the chest.
That would be pretty heavy.
All right.
Cool.
So, you guys are able to find that.
You guys, and, you know, taking a few minutes, like, staring out at the sea.
Um, I'm sure that some of you who've been, like, in this area for a while, or, you know, a, a cleric of the sea goddess, you know, staring over this tide pool, um, and off into the distant sea, like, not into the ward itself.
You do get this, this sense of, of peace and safety, and that can only be found in, in the sea of, uh, in the sea of poop, uh, in Maris.
After a few moments, you steel yourselves and head back.
Um, after about, um, after about four hours, you get to the end of the day, you do make it to the, um, to the area for, um, the outpost for the Irontide Regiment.
Um, you are likewise, you have the letters of introduction.
They take you in, no questions asked, um, and it's set you up.
You can choose to take a long rest here if you so desire.
We desire.
And I need you guys to roll a con save, DC 12.
Oh my god, Normie.
Uh, so we're rolling a D20.
Okay.
Yep.
And then, what's the two?
Oh yeah, I do have a point show.
That'll get me there.
Well, that's not going to get you to DC 12.
But your con is, if you flip your character sheet, it's the, it's the heart at the top, and then the save is the top bubble.
So, it's two plus, looks like three.
So, um, five.
Don't pull Coral.
Oh, I failed.
Third fail.
All right.
I do need a long one point, though.
I see, I, you get a long point on failed saves, right?
Uh, yeah.
For this, for sure.
Do you get a long point if you fail a death save?
Good question.
You could lose one.
Probably.
I say, you've all, also a great question.
Can you, I would, if there would be a time you could use a long, I don't think it would be on a death save.
Today, you legit can use them on death saves.
No, I don't get it.
I spent, he spent one.
It's already over there.
Okay.
Cool.
Um, you, you are now, um, after having spent a day kind of resting, recouping.
Um, if anybody has any specific thoughts to what they, um, any thoughts to what their character would be doing during this time, we can totally, we can totally share that now.
Otherwise, we can just kind of move on to the next.
Yep.
So.
I would like to fill my backpack with water.
It's far the inside.
Only one use.
That's, that's fine.
But yeah, no, you can, you can, I, like, I'm just, I'm just thinking you're probably going to be running around with so many blood.
I just can't.
The idea is I want to turn the backpack into like a back sheath for my, uh, my flail.
So when I draw it out, it's coded to begin with.
That's, that's, that's a really good idea.
Um, that is, that is solid.
There will need to be some sort of.
Fair enough.
Some sort of roll.
That's right.
To make sure that this thing happens, but I like where your head's at.
Perfect.
So I'm totally fine with that.
Okay.
So do we have any, does anybody have any healing functions left?
Oh yeah.
I got like four of them.
Yep.
I got one.
I, uh.
We're long resting, so you will get all your, if we long rest, you get all your hit points back.
I may, and all your spells, yep, and all your spells, any resources you spent as well.
Um, so yeah, when you long rest, you recover any spells.
Some of those ridiculous looking characters.
Any points.
If I read it, I'll read it also.
He's in a cobalt with a boat anchor and a chest as a backpack and a little ball.
It's in a cobalt as well.
So that one hit die that you bought.
Oh, you get the coral bros.
And again, coral growing out of him.
So I think it's on the other side.
He's only filled one save, so he's not really evil yet, but he's a scratcher.
If he's in a section, it's like underneath their hit points.
You've got one hit spend.
That goes back.
It's terrible.
I have not used any hit dice.
All right.
And I have one block point.
Okay, everything's good.
So, uh, you are about a half, you're about a half day's journey from the coalf that you
think that the, uh, that, that you think is the most likely landing spot for the pirates.
Um, after having taken a long rest, start moving in that direction.
Um, again, you know, it's the closer you get to the sea, the more peace you feel.
The first, you know, the more you look into the ward, the more of just this feeling of
dread thing.
Um, you do make it to the cove.
Uh, there, you are able to see the pirate ship off in the distance.
Um, there are no pirates milling about here.
Um, do you guys, how do you want to hail them?
So, sorry, I just want to clarify a little bit with, uh, is it like, is like a dread,
like a fear dread or like, uh, just like a sinking feeling or the sinking feeling?
Okay.
Okay.
Like, you know, it's just like trying to figure out like, yeah, you know, that, you know,
that feeling, it's not like I'm going to die.
Right.
Yeah.
It's not like you're sinking death.
It's like, um, you know, that feeling where like your heart sinks, but you just can't
really, you can't really put a finger on, it's just like, you've got the seasonal affective
disorder.
Like your heart just drops in your stomach and you just feel nasty.
Do you like that?
I just feel bad.
I don't know what I, you know, that's kind of what, what, that's kind of what the ward
looks like.
Okay.
So, so, so not fear.
So that's okay.
We're fine.
Yeah.
I am normal.
Uh, point one or two, I was going to do this, but I totally forgot to mention it.
Uh, standard operating procedure going forward.
Um, unless somebody specifically does not want me to, uh, Xander is going to keep a light
on every person, a party because I can tactical nuke through my light.
So keep getting up on everyone.
Tactically nuke me.
No, no, not you.
At least.
Oh, I guess.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Says the guy who wants to die.
I just want to be dead.
It's slightly different.
He's not in a rush.
Remember.
He wants to be dead.
I want to be on the edge of death.
Well.
So, and these guys all want to live.
So, in all actuality, I mean, you don't really want to be dead.
You just want to be back in heaven.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're trying to get back to the Nexus.
God.
This place sucks.
Yeah.
Amazing.
Oh, God.
I'm scoring.
Oh, no.
It's the water in which we drown.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh, and specifically for a little, John, I'm going to keep one of your arrows lit up.
Oh, yeah.
So, maybe you can shoot it and light up wherever it lands.
Tracer arrows on it, which would be really useful.
Yeah.
That's sick.
Posit, if we're going to try to hide, probably don't have all this light on us.
But, you know, we need to hide, like, a turtle off.
Yeah.
So, but that does, again, lead to how are you guys going to be trying to hail the pirates?
Are you just going to be waiting around for pirates to hopefully ship on them?
We didn't plan that far ahead, so probably that won't.
Let's look.
Let me get its attention.
Like, I got this.
Kirk just yells really loud.
Go in athletics.
DC 21.
I should have raged.
I should have raged first.
Don't act about actually training in athletics.
See if you can see how strong your diaphragm is.
No.
No.
Takeoffs.
I think I don't.
You swallow a bug as you go.
You start to yell and just inhale a little bit.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You never see.
Oh, the bug.
I don't prefer something.
Oh, that's a smart repeat.
Okay.
Follow the destination and see if you can find something to make a horn out of you.
I'm going to combine Firebolt and the Thaumaturgy to make a flare gun.
Okay.
I mean.
That's some minor wish bullshit right there if I've ever seen it.
That seems like the Thaumaturgy can actually do, though.
Yeah.
Thaumaturgy makes a loud noise.
Yeah.
No.
Okay.
Yeah.
Firework.
Fair enough.
Oh, that's fair enough.
So usually your shell could go up with whatever he's doing.
In my mind, his firebolt at the top of his arc, a little white flag pops out of it.
Yeah.
So we surrender.
Yeah.
Oh.
Uh.
My, my, my weapon, uh, I will hold and make it in my pocket.
Okay.
I'll smoke.
Yeah.
Um, also Derek, um, just, just want to make sure that you're aware that there is, um, yeah,
you can, again, you can spend, spend your stuff anyway, but it's kind of, there's a lot of
there's a lot, there's a lot going on here.
Uh, there is one person or one of your teammates that doesn't have a magical weapon.
Um, and that is, I know.
I thought his, his wrists made the things magic.
No, it just adds damage.
Okay.
Well, I can certainly, uh, make his thing magical.
So if we'll have done it.
You might not have done this.
Um, I don't freeze things for a while.
As a character.
Maybe.
Yeah.
It was a character.
Yeah.
Um, so yeah, if, if you will allow me, I will take your, your bow and spend an hour while we
are at camp, uh, concentrating and tinkering on it.
Uh, and I will give it back to you and it will be a plus one weapon.
Oh.
So what that means on your character sheet, um, is if you, until I determine that it's
not a plus one, like a long bow.
No, you take it away when he makes it bad.
You get a plus six instead of a, instead of a plus five.
And the damage that you do is plus six instead of plus, instead of five.
So, um, and just make a note of that being something that, um, like just like on the bow
or, or whatever, or yeah, in the, in the treasure area, just say that, you know, it's
Jezrex.
It's a little bit of creation.
Yeah.
But, because he might have to take it back at some point, in which case, you know, we
need to lose that.
Okay.
Okay.
Uh, so you send out, you send out a flare.
He may need to go out.
He maybe needs to get out or he maybe just needs to be confused.
Boys, we are not doing this.
Excuse me.
We have company.
You're not just going to stand there and sniff it.
She started doing this recently.
Yeah.
Doesn't want to go outside, but he doesn't, but he wants to smell it.
Oh, it's cold out there.
Why are you cold?
But I want to know what's going on.
So I got to, got to sniff the air.
Um, all right.
Um, you send out your flare.
Yeah.
Um, you see in the distance movement on the ship.
Um, after a few minutes, you see one of the dinghies gets lowered into the ocean.
Um, and, um, there are a number of pirates that are on there.
Um, as the dinghy becomes closer, there's one pirate, um, that is kind of standing in the front.
Um, he looks very odd.
Um, for one, his eyes are, are jet black.
Um, two, he doesn't appear to have a face of anything.
Um, but he has eyes, but no face.
He has no eyes, no nose, no mouth.
Set on a, on a extremely pale and pallid skin.
That's gross.
Um, with pointed gears, um, and he has a captain's hat.
Um, he's flanked by a few, flanked by a few other, well, there are other pirates in the ship.
But also, um, you do see a, that kobold that you saw with the pirates is also in that.
Kobold you saw with the pirates?
Dragon pirates.
Fresh my memory.
I don't remember a kobold.
Uh, there's, when the, when the pirates came to, uh, came to attack the kobold, there was a kobold and.
Oh, okay.
Yep.
Okay.
Yep.
Okay.
Yep.
I remember now.
Thank you.
Also.
Did his call, did it get much worse?
Oh, yes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Um, you actually now have kind of like a crustacean that's forming on your neck and it's spreading.
Um, nothing that affects you mechanically at this point, but, um, from a role-playing perspective,
it's like you have a perpetual kinky in your neck.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, you, you, you can, you can bend your neck this way, but when you hit here, it's
like, it's like a Batman suit, kind of.
Um, so you have to move your, um, when you get into the, when you get into the second century,
that's when, that's when you gotta start doing the impetus to be flexible.
Um, and it's not, and it's not like extreme, like, it's not a huge inconvenience.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Um, it's just kind of like one of those things where it's like, okay, there's something more
of an annoyance.
Yeah.
Um, as this, um, as this pirate, uh, captain, going outside, go on.
What do you think?
Let's go.
Ruffs, do you want to go?
Okay.
Actually, I don't know about all that he said, okay, as well.
Uh, so basically at this point, uh, you are going to be, um, we'll kind of leave it at
that.
Yeah, because the pirates are approaching.
The pirates are approaching, you're in the flow, um, you look at the white flags if you
talk, maybe.
Yeah, yeah.
Um, here to fight, maybe.
We're going to be deserving of having a good time.
Everybody, uh, as far as experience goes, everybody gets a thousand experience for it.
2,900?
Yep.
And I mean, uh, experience right there.
Thousand.
What is level four?
Uh, 37.
If I'm remembering correctly.
Excellent.
You said we get a thousand?
Yep.
You're at a total of 2,900 if my math was meant for my math.
That is correct.
It lasts for the same math.
I can do math, but a lot of it's zeros.
That's true.
Well, I really have to add two numbers together.
Yeah.
All right.
I learned another immune spell.
Not yet.
You didn't?
I mean, at fourth level when I get there.
Mm-hmm.
I don't know what I get at fourth.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what you're saying.
Yeah.
Mm.
I don't know what I'm happy about it.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what I'm happy about it.
You're listening to another world.
I don't know what you're doing.
I'm sorry.
I don't know.
I don't know what happened.
I know what happened to her.
There it will be.
Oh, so, you're Arrow.
Right.
I don't know what I said, and then I'm sorry I don't know.
I don't know what I'm sorry.
You're listening to every school.
I don't know what I get at fourth.
I don't know what I front was.
One of my boys still on the same time.
