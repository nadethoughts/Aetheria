# Transcript
After braiding the mischoked sweets of the Tag Watch Lord,
you found shelter in the battered remains of the Salty Dog.
An old haunt of skirks, now haunted by silence.
Your arrival was anything but quiet, a skirmish,
with skull-shelled crabs and a monstrous frog left you bloody but alive.
And the tavern, the tavern's hidden corners soon yielded more than just dust.
Mistral uncovered a cryptic pirate graffiti in thieves' cans,
hinting at secrets buried, where the room runs dry and secrets sleep,
behind the dog, the gold runs deep.
Your curiosity led to a puzzle,
a hidden mechanism that responded to the elements,
opening a secret passage beneath the tavern,
where the treasure vaults, where a treasure vaults,
you faced animated,
where in the treasure vault, oh my gosh,
you faced animated armor,
a mimic disguised as a chest,
and other enchanted guardians.
Victory brought you gold,
magical gear,
and also a fragment of a pirate.
It's clues pointing deeper into the lord,
closer to some sort of pearl.
As night fell,
you kept watch from the tavern's rooftop,
glimpsing a mute,
glimpsing mutated coral people,
and stranger things moving through the fog.
At dawn, a thunderous pulse of light erupted to the south,
signaling dark rituals at work.
Following the disturbance,
you confronted cultists,
channeling the storm magic,
through the crystal orb,
fighting to destroy it,
before it could summon a tide of monsters.
With teamwork and grit,
they shattered the orb,
and, or you shattered the orb,
scattered the cultists,
and earned a respite.
Yet the dangers of the war bloom ever closer,
as Miseril's map and Jeseric's compass
now beckoned you further south,
toward the heart of the mystery.
As we, uh,
as we continue,
uh,
we just finished at,
as the combat completed.
Oh,
oh,
you saw in the distance the,
uh,
these creatures,
um,
that looked like they used to be
people,
um,
now covered in coral,
and their eyes,
if you remember,
their eyes were,
um,
the shape of pearls.
Um,
in the distance,
there were a number of them
that were moving towards
that crystal orb.
Once you destroyed it,
um,
and when you destroyed it,
you shot backwards.
This is where your
anchor got its,
got its magic.
The,
it disrupted the ritual,
and was infused with,
um,
with a lightning storm.
Um,
which need water,
right?
Mm-hmm.
Need water.
Yep.
Um,
the monsters that were moving
towards that crystal ball
all seemed to just turn
and start heading south again.
Um,
in the aftermath of the,
uh,
of,
of the actual combat itself,
does anybody have any things
that they wish to do?
Um,
you're telling me,
you have a shattered orb.
We'll give you one second.
Sorry,
I asked you a question.
And,
just,
I'll be going right through.
Um,
anything you want to do?
I don't give a shit.
I'm going to keep talking.
Um,
just,
just as a reminder,
you have the crystal orb
to the south.
Um,
there,
you're in a,
um,
you're in a town square
sort of,
place where there's
a giant statue
in the middle of it.
Um,
and,
yeah,
so,
Ian.
I wanted to see,
anybody can't lose the bodies yet.
Nobody has started
looking at the bodies yet,
as far as I know.
I didn't really lose the bodies
because of what I mean.
All right.
All right.
So,
you guys start going through the,
going through the,
uh,
the,
the people that are left.
Um,
you do find,
um,
roughly
400 gold pieces,
which should be enough
for each of you
to have
100 gold.
Sure.
Taking us to,
well,
taking me
600 gold.
these are just,
they're not the richest people.
They're not the richest people
in the world.
That's still,
other than their gold
we found earlier,
like,
it's like many,
multiple times
the amount of gold,
50 times more wealth
than I've ever seen
in my life.
They're not the richest.
I thought I was living large
on my 20 silver pieces.
They're,
they're,
didn't know what I didn't have.
They're just
lowly millionaires.
That's right.
That's right.
They got a small load
of ungold pieces.
Well,
where is the,
what,
where is the money?
We found the other sizes.
Yep.
They say the first hundred
is the hardest.
Yep.
And then it compounds
from there.
So,
now you have 610 gold.
All right.
Uh,
does anybody else
have anything
that they wish
could do?
How far back
did I get knocked
by this thing
when I smashed it?
Um,
so,
if you remember the,
well,
I can actually just
pull out the layout
of the map.
Um,
I'm gonna make it
nice and easy.
Okay.
What tables?
All right.
So,
the,
um,
the crystal itself
was
down here.
Mm-hmm.
Um,
and you were
attacking it
right there.
Yep.
Yep.
You got knocked
back to here.
Oh!
You,
you,
you got thrown
back,
like,
one-eight feet.
Dang!
Oh,
I wanted to check
the statue
to see if there's
anything
interesting about it.
It has an imprint
of Skirk
on it now.
It has an imprint
of a,
uh,
of a
bubble that
looks familiar.
other than
that,
after a,
after a careful
search of
the,
um,
of the statue,
you don't find
anything that's
out of the
ordinary,
um,
and that will
take a while,
so I'll give
the other
people.
Yeah,
yeah.
I heard
certain statues
on markers
and whatnot.
Well,
I mean,
it's,
it's a town
square statue.
Yeah.
Nothing,
nothing too,
nothing too
out of the
ordinary.
Nothing too
out of the
Yep.
You can hold
markers,
that's,
that's,
that's,
all right.
Uh,
anybody else
have anything
that they wish
to do
at this moment?
Um,
I'm probably,
I'm probably,
I'm also
kind of like
just thematic
and role-playing
wise,
like I probably
took a jolt
when that
happened too
and like,
so Skirk,
like whatever
you guys are
doing this,
Skirk is just
kind of like
dazed and out
of it and
trying to like,
yeah,
what the
just happened?
He also
mentions to them
that they can
check the crystal
to see what
it's,
what,
what it's
made of.
Well,
yeah,
um,
if anybody
wants to check
out the crystal,
you are more
than welcome
to do so.
Um,
but,
they get
to make
their,
I'm just
mentioning,
mentioning it's
that.
Is my flail
like glowing
or anything?
It does,
like,
like,
when you get,
when you get,
when I finally
wake the hell up
and like,
you see,
you see like
lightning dancing
across it,
across the actual,
like the anchor
itself,
as it drips
with some sort
on water.
Okay.
After a while
of looking at
it,
it,
uh,
it starts to,
it starts to dry
and then the,
and the lightning
just kind of
ends up,
it never disappears
completely.
It's always
there,
but it's not
as active.
Okay.
While it's still
kind of wet
and sparking a little,
Xander,
touch this.
Ramsey,
pull your own
damage.
2d6.
Um,
oh,
it did.
Lightning again.
Well,
now we know.
Oh,
that's,
that's fine.
Fine.
Well,
I'm willing to pay
that price for
knowing what
happens.
The question is,
is Xander,
he's a cleric.
He can heal himself.
I'm going to go
wander around.
That was cool.
Yeah.
Good one.
Just all these
pieces of glass
or whatever
this little thing
was made of.
All right.
And I'm going to
spend a low-life
work since
and let us
figure out
what the hell
has happened.
Very strange.
I can't tell
I've never done
that before.
I swear.
So,
with your
maker of
background,
you've never
seen anything
like this,
anything quite
like this.
This is sort
of a unique
sort of thing.
But being
that you do
have a maker
background and
you know how
things function
in that kind of
thing,
your best guess
is that there
was some sort
of ritual magic
that was taking
place in that
crystal.
And when
Skirk destroyed
it and shattered
the crystal ball,
the magic
that was
inside that
crystal ball
got infused
into his
weapon and
basically
created
a
effectively
an artifact.
So,
something
really powerful.
Also,
as you're
looking around,
can you go
ahead and
roll me a
DC 18
perception check?
roll a
d20 and
then add
your perception
to it and
train his
an 18.
Five.
I think
we need
for Christmas
to get
Ryan some
dice.
16.
I really
butchered that
sentence and
I apologize.
Okay.
So,
you did not
hit the 18,
so whatever
you were
supposed to
notice,
you didn't
notice.
But,
after,
you know,
as,
Arthur,
as you're
finishing
examining,
examining the
actual,
like,
statue itself,
and,
oh,
okay.
John,
I thought it
was a
four for
it.
The
crystals,
you hear
the telltale
sound of
a bow
being
drawn.
You
specifically
would be
very familiar
with that,
as that's a
sound that you
make quite
often.
The rest of
you do not
pick that up,
but you do
hear a voice
calling from
the shadows.
I thought we
told you to
clear out.
Pirates aren't
welcome here.
Wisconsin.
responses.
I'm trying to
remember.
We haven't
actually met
anything living
in here yet.
You haven't
met anything
that was
sentient.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Yes.
Okay,
all right.
I just want to
make sure.
I think the
cultists,
which could
count as
sentient,
you know,
probably,
they might
have been,
but Xander
just calls out.
Nothing's
taught to you.
Xander just
calls out,
good to
know.
hate pirates.
I can't be a
pirate.
I've never
been on a
boat in my
life.
Well,
except that
one time
when I
worked on
a boat.
I had to
load some
stuff on a
boat,
but I
never sailed
on a boat.
Yeah,
yeah.
I'm going to
hold my
arrows down.
Close my
face.
I'm ready
for action
here.
I,
I,
I,
I'm not
going to
piracy.
Right.
Um,
after a
few moments,
um,
you hear
again from
the shadows.
Um,
as,
as you
look,
you,
you heard
the voice
that are
looking in
the general
direction.
You do
see a
shadowed
figure in
one of the,
in the alley
that's just
down here.
This alley?
Yeah.
the shadowed
figure,
um,
doesn't appear
to have
a bow and
you were
actually that
direction.
You heard the
bowstring.
So you know
that there are
at least two
people.
Um,
he,
he,
after a few
moments,
he says,
uh,
he calls
out,
um,
if you're
not pirates,
I know you're
not cultists.
What are
you?
I'm
cobalt.
You,
you,
you don't
see it,
but you
feel the
biggest eyebrow
in the world.
We
all
ventures,
well,
adventurers
hire from,
from the
guard.
You
can reclaim
this
ward.
again,
there's a
pregnant
silence.
Um,
and after
a few
moments,
you see
the shadowy
figure start
to walk
forward.
Um,
that figure
has
a bit
of a
weird
gait.
almost like,
you know,
he's kind
of dragging
one of
his feet.
Um,
and
if I can
buttons be
quicker.
Um,
as,
as time
goes on,
or as he
continues to
move forward,
um,
you see
the figure
is
cloaked,
um,
with a bit
of a hump
on one
shoulder.
Um,
he walks
with his
hand on
the hilt
of a
sword,
and,
uh,
his,
and his
face is
covered.
So,
he's basically
dark clothes,
dark cloak,
um,
face is
covered,
not really
getting a lot
out of,
out of him.
The only,
the only
things that
you notice
is his
right side,
um,
you see
a larger
lump,
um,
that's being
covered by
the cloak,
um,
and he's,
appears to be
dragging his
right foot
with him.
Um,
when he
comes out,
he says,
so the,
um,
he,
he comes
out,
he looks
at you,
he's at
the edge
of the,
edge of the
alley at
that point,
um,
and says,
so they
sent more
to die?
We're not
dead yet.
Wouldn't be
the first
time.
What?
Okay.
Keep
clutching
this,
this arrow,
I'm ready
to shoot
this guy
on the,
yeah,
move towards
him a little
bit.
Are you
moving in
a threatening
position?
Uh,
it's more
of a reaction
to his reaction,
which is,
why are you
here?
So may I
inquire?
our kingdom.
Okay.
So,
so,
we come
to help
claim this
ward for
monsters and
demons,
but otherwise
we come in
peace.
All right.
And we
are not
pirates.
But he
definitely
notices me
and I
definitely
notice him.
Oh,
yeah,
there's
no not
noticing
you.
So,
we all
kind of
stand out.
We do
all kind
of stand out.
I'm sure
he gets
you.
Um,
so,
he,
he,
you know,
he looks
at you
and he
says,
um,
it's just
like,
you know,
he's
sizing you
guys up.
And,
um,
it's like,
well,
I do
not have
any
ill will
towards
the enemies
of demons
and pirates.
It is
somewhat
distressing
that
Frederick
let
let
just
come
civilians
into
the
ward
but
they
must
be
strapped.
I don't
know,
Frederick,
he's the
gatekeeper.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Um,
and
you guys
were
aware
that there
were
other
iron watch
iron
iron
tide
regiment
that
were
sensed
into
the
ward
but
they
never
returned
to
NRC
yet.
Yep.
Yep.
So.
Someone
with more
than an
eight
intelligence
could make
a connection
here.
I will
make no
such
connections.
No
such
connections.
Okay.
But
everybody
else
do.
Nobody
else
has
an eight
intelligence.
Nah.
Probably
is a,
if you
have
average
intelligence,
you can
put
two
and
two
down.
Yeah,
smarter
than the
average
bear.
So.
Okay.
Talk to
that.
Bricks
falls
into the,
that's
the reason
they can't
have
good
trash
cans
at
Yellowstone.
What's that?
What?
So do you
fall into
the reason
why they
can't
have
a good
trash
can
at
Yellowstone?
I know.
So.
They're
not
wrong.
So the
cobalt
are
clearest
as to
what this
means.
Because they
are both
sitting at
their
low
average
and
probably
just
loving it.
They're loving it.
They don't know
what they're
missing.
Absolutely.
Well,
I thought I was
living large
on 20
silver pieces.
Xander
will speak
up and
say,
it's
funny.
Everyone
thinks you're
dead,
too.
We were
told no one
lived.
We sent
it here.
Well,
whether they
think we're
dead or
not,
they did
not accept
us when we
did return.
Yeah.
And after
a few
moments,
he
kind of
pushes
back his
cloak,
takes off
his towel,
and you
are being
troll.
No,
you're a
demon.
Kill him.
You see
an elf
that
is
that
is
as
best as
you can
tell,
his skin
is grafted
with
coal.
Kirk
instinctively
reaches for
his flail.
And when
you do
that,
you kind
of see
a smirk
on his
face,
and he
says,
that's what
they did,
too.
We are
considered
monsters
in their
eyes.
But
we have
family,
we have
friends,
and we
support
and protect
them.
We
are what's
keeping
this ward
from invading
the rest
of the
city.
city.
Not
sorry.
Wall.
Sorry I
just killed
three of
you then.
Hey,
he
smiles and
he says,
no,
you did
not.
There
are more
than just
us and
monsters
here.
there's
an
entire
ecosystem
I'll
treat
this
with.
Are we
going to
start
growing like
that?
Over
time,
yes.
How long
a time?
I don't
want to
be like
that.
It
depends on
you.
I got
these
nice
shiny
red
scales.
I don't
want to
mess
them up
with
red
coral.
It
depends
on the
person
and
their
natural
resistance.
Ah,
some
people
come to
the coral
almost
immediately.
Others
could take
weeks.
That one
over
there
seems like
he's
already
starting
to
succumb
as
Arthur,
you find
yourself
scratching
your neck.
Maybe we
should have
some of
that.
Okay.
Those of
you that
see where
he
very deliberately
takes a few
steps away
from Arthur.
You
nobody really
sees anything
about
Arthur.
You're
scratching
your neck.
You feel
like your
skin
underneath
your fur
is a
little bit
more
scaly.
Please tell
me there
was a
cure for
that.
Why did
this cover
the fogs?
he looks
at you
in the
eye and
says,
if I knew
about a
cure,
do you
think I
would look
like this?
I mean,
I...
That's kind
of a
dare.
I mean,
yeah,
I mean,
you couldn't
know
of a
talk
book here,
but you
don't know
how to
get
the
way.
That's
why I
asked.
He's
all that
have
become
have
eventually
have
eventually
become
coral
marks,
as we
call
ourselves.
But we
are not
the
same
as
those
in
points
to
the
south.
Those
are what
happens when
you die.
Takes
about
a day
for the
coral to
invade
and take
over.
and you
can tell
them apart
from the
rest of
us
because
of their
pearl
shaped eyes.
They have
no mind
and they
hang out
in the
center of
the
center of
the
war.
as long
as we
don't
enter
into
that
area,
they
leave us
away.
I'm going
to add
that to
the
list of
my
reasons
to
not
die.
Maybe
the
coral
people are
guarding
something.
We have
thought
that.
we do
have
and as
he starts
saying
that you
hear a
rougher
call.
He
holds
the
he
stops
talking
and
holds up
his hand
and says
fight.
he
basically
just
melts
back
into
the
shadows.
You
guys
can
choose
to
follow
him
if
you
want
to
or
you
can
choose
to
hide
by
your
own
means.
But he
very
abruptly
finished.
I'm going to
follow him
because I
can't hide
where shit
on my
own.
I'm
going to
regroup
with a
guy
with
lightning
staff.
Well
actually
I'm
probably
here
still
because I
don't think
I moved.
Where did he
came from
this alleyway?
He's from that
alleyway.
I'll go hide in
this.
I'll go hide in
the house.
Okay.
I'm
hiding the
house.
Hmm.
Which
direction did
the bird
call come
from?
It came
from
that way.
You
went down
here.
Yeah.
I think
if I'm
here
I'm
probably
going to
duck
into
this
building
here.
Okay.
I'm
following
him.
Where
were
he
going?
I'm
not
going
to
be
too
split
up
but
necessarily
draw
everybody's
attention.
So I'm
going to
hide in
this
hole.
Outbuilding
here to
the best
of my
ability.
Okay.
I don't
hide so
well.
After
a few
minutes you
hear kind
of like
the
footfalls
of leather
booted
feet.
and you
hear
you hear
a voice
pretty
harsh
that says
well they
ran down
this way
pretty
quickly.
They've
got to be
around here
somewhere.
Remember
we're
looking for
the
monk.
We
don't
care
about
the
rest.
The
rest?
As you
like
what
what do
you guys
what do
you guys
do?
Just
hiding out
still?
is there
any
window
or
crack?
I'm
assuming
there's
something
because we
see
or
something
that I
can
see
through?
Yeah.
Well for
you I
don't see
a window
in that
building.
You probably
could peek
around the
corner.
I mean
this is
this is
pretty
well
rubble.
Oh no
you're
going to
get
rubbled.
Yes.
There were
two voices?
There were
two voices
but you
heard a
lot
you heard
a lot
more
of
the
all.
Oh
okay.
Okay.
So
are our
battle
compatriots
I assume
still with
us?
Yes.
Okay.
all right.
The
okay so
you peek
around
the corner
yeah
well
can you
can you
roll a
stealth?
Oh
and it
does it's
it's like a
DC 10
stealth.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's just
more along
the lines
of them
of whether
or not
you make
a noise
when you're
kind of
sure.
Yeah that's
fine.
Oh.
I know
stealth isn't
your strong
role.
Cast guiding
first.
As bad as I
thought.
Myself is
actually pretty
hot.
you have to
you have to
actually
save things
so but
it doesn't
matter if
your stealth
was good
because he's
the one
who's peeking
around the
corner.
If you want
to peek
around the
corner then
you have to
roll.
Oh
all.
Oh sir.
Nope.
What you
get?
Got an
eight.
How many
luck points
do you
have?
None.
Oh well I
guess I have
one now or
no.
That's just
attacks right?
Yeah.
Well it's not
just attacks but
it's in combat
tense situation.
So it doesn't
it doesn't
it doesn't
happen like
if you're
just like
oh I just
want to
I'd like to
roll out
perception.
I do think
that this
will qualify
as a tense
situation.
So have
a luck
man.
Absolutely.
I'm trying to
figure out what
he just saw.
I'm trying to
very nuts and
deadly.
You probably
don't even know
that he saw
anything.
I'm across
I'm on the
other side of
this thing.
So I'm like
what did you
just see?
Right.
So basically
what you
the the
three of
you hear
kind of
like a
you have
chain armor
right?
Scaled.
Very close.
Yes.
So you hear
like this
metal
good
scraping
noise
coming from
the
northwestern
so
area.
Now
Xander
you do
see
you see
a group
of
what can
only be
described
as
pirates.
Oh
OK.
At the
at the
front of
the at the
front of the
group and
it is a
pretty large
group.
It's not
like the
largest group
in the world
but they're
like
six to
eight that
you can
see.
OK.
but the
two that
we're
talking
one of
them
is a
true scale
cold
and
the
other
pretty cool
looking
cold
bald.
Yeah.
He's OK.
OK.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And the
other
appears to
be
some
sort
of
undead
creature.
Hmm.
Excellent.
And they
are,
you know,
again,
they're like
four to
six other
other
pirates of
various
various
ethnicities
and
heritages
and that's
Yeah.
But those
are the
two main
ones.
OK.
When you
peek around
the corner
and you
get a
glimpse
of them,
you do
you do
scrape
your scale
mail against
the against
the stone
of the
of the
wall that
you were
basically
trying to
stay glued
to.
Yeah.
And they
and they
immediately
like perk
up and
say,
what was
that?
They start
looking around.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're the
Metal Gear
Solid Alert
noise.
Right.
Exactly.
That's exactly
what's happening.
so they
haven't spotted
you, but
they know
that
something's
up.
Something's
up somewhere.
Our friend
would have
heard that
it's the
notification
on, like
the notification
sound on
his phone.
The worst.
Yeah.
OK.
OK.
OK.
Why?
I am
continuing to
hide.
I'm blissfully
unaware that
any of this
is happening.
I almost
certainly have
a reaction
to my
longbow
down and
I have
retrieved
my short
swords.
Yeah.
I have a
capitol.
So where
is everyone
here?
I am.
He's.
We're both
getting ready.
Where are you
going?
Like I
whispered.
Where are you
going?
Yeah.
Like I
didn't hear
any of
this.
Right.
You're
looking at
us.
We're sort
of.
I'm
like hidden
back here
in here.
I don't
see shit.
Those
would.
That's not
me.
That's not
me.
You're in a
different
building,
right?
No, we're
both in
this building.
Oh, OK.
One of us
has to go
peek around
the corner
then.
Why?
I don't
know anything
is going
on.
Well, you
all heard
you all
heard a
noise.
I mean, I
heard a
scraping
noise and
I heard
people talking.
I'm still
hiding.
No, and
you are
fine to
keep doing
that.
I'm just
saying like
if you
have any
sort of
suspicious
nature,
you might
be like,
oh, somebody
did something
stupid.
All right.
So just
paint the
picture.
This building
is pretty
rubble,
you said,
right?
Right.
Well, I
mean, in
general, a
lot of
the buildings
themselves,
they're just
really good.
Sure, sure,
sure, sure.
Would it be
fair and
accurate to
say that
there is
maybe a
hole in
the roof
somewhere?
I can see
open sky?
I would say
that is very
fair and
accurate.
Excellent.
Then I'm
going to
attempt,
which may
not be
successful,
but we
were going
to try
to as
quietly as
I possibly
can.
Cast
Thaumaturgy.
Okay.
Cast what?
Thaumaturgy.
And I'm
going to
cause it
to, right
out of the
book, this
is one of the
options, and
it sounds
freaking great.
I'm just
going to
modify it a
little bit.
Out of the
book, it
says that you
can make
small sounds
like whispers
or the cry
of a raven,
except we're
not going to
have a raven.
We're going
to make
seagull
noises, and
we're going
to, it's
only 30
feet away, so
it's going to
be kind of
like the top
of the building
essentially.
Okay.
All right.
Sorry, the
book says you
can make raven
noises, not
seagull
noises.
Can you
make the
seagull
noises?
Yeah, yeah.
I don't think
I need to make
you roll
a performance.
I think I
do need to
make them
make a
roll of
some kind.
Yeah, yeah.
I mean, it
does have a
verbal component.
I have to
speak.
Maybe a
stealth check
or something
when you're
speaking.
Perception
or perception
on that.
Yeah, yeah,
yeah.
Well, I
would say
that for
you, if
like, I
don't think
stealth, but
maybe performance,
that seems to
make more
sense to me
because
performance is
like, basically
you're
like, stealth
is like, oh,
I'm agile,
I'm gonna
move around
and make
quiet noises
and that
kind of stuff.
But I don't
like, to speak
your spell
quietly, I
don't think
that's agile.
That's more of a
charisma.
I don't know
what I'm
saying.
So, if you
can roll that
to see if you
can reduce
good luck,
sir, I know
we have a
good luck,
circle spell,
but yeah,
yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah,
yeah.
Is your
charisma worse?
Oh, it's
real bad.
Oh, man.
It's real
bad.
But,
no,
no,
no.
And that
diet needs to
be the first
to go because
that's unreadable
too.
It's not
unreadable.
It's very
readable.
It was not
readable when it
was here.
Oh, it's
readable to me.
Well, that
doesn't matter
so much to
me.
Awesome.
Okay.
That's a little
bright guy.
Okay.
Okay, that's
kind of cool.
Still unreadable.
There's a reason
I hid by myself.
Yeah, so,
so they heard
the, uh,
they hear the
seagulls at
the top of
the building.
Yep.
And so they,
so they just
start moving
towards that
building.
Yep.
So, um,
they, these
guys don't
actually do
the, do the
thing.
They basically
tell their
I have a
question.
Yes.
When we were
all running and
dashing to hide
places, how
aware were we of
where other
people were
hiding?
Like, do I
even know he's
in this room?
That's a good
question.
Um, I
would give
high or low.
High.
You roll it.
High.
What am I
rolling?
20.
I didn't get
my dice out.
If you, and
if you roll
above a 10,
then you know
exactly where
everybody is.
Okay.
If you roll
below a 10,
then, or
below a 10,
then I know
little John is
in the same
room with me.
Well, no,
if you're under
a five, you
know, little John's
in the same
room with me.
If you roll
between a six
and a, six and
a 10, you
know, about
where people
are, you know
which direction
they started
moving.
Okay.
Okay.
Um, but if
you roll above
a 10, you
know what
they got it
to.
I know where
everybody's at.
All right.
You know.
That's helpful.
Um, okay.
So the, um,
so Xander, like
you make that
noise.
Um, these
guys start
moving up.
Um, and
they are
being relatively
stealthy, but
like everybody
kind of knows
that something's
going on.
So you're
aware, they're
aware.
Um, what are
you going to
do?
They're
closing in
on you.
What am I
going to do?
Yeah.
How quickly
are they
closing in?
Like, are
they being
careful and
slow?
They're being
careful and
slow.
They're not
running, running
straight in.
Yeah.
Um, and
the other, the
other three of
you, like
same, same
basic thing.
Like, you
know, you're
aware that
they're aware
that something's
happening.
Are any of
these windows
broken?
Uh, yeah.
Any of them
that you want
to be broken.
I'm going to
find something
small.
Okay.
And they're
all, because
they're all
moving towards
this building.
I'm assuming
they're all
kind of facing
this direction.
Right.
That's, that
building has
their attention.
I'm going to
find something
to throw and
huck it out
this window
this direction.
Okay.
All right.
In an attempt
to distract
them.
I'm still
going to look
at it like,
what are you
doing?
So, why
did you throw
a pebble
out of the
window?
Roll a
DC 14
stealth roll
with advantage.
Roll a
D.
Got it.
That's a
20.
Nailed it.
Okay.
Oh, sorry.
So, DC,
I don't even
remember what
DC stands for.
Difficulty class.
Difficulty class.
So, it's
the number
that you need
to hit
when you
roll the
dice.
Uh,
all right.
So, you
head over
to that
corner.
You find
a window.
They are
completely
distracted,
entirely
focused on
that building
over there.
And you
chuck up,
I don't
know,
something.
Yeah.
I don't
know what
kind of
building this
is, so.
Um, well,
what kind of
building do
you want it
to be?
It is,
it's actually
a small
warehouse.
All right.
So, I find,
like, just some
random good or
something, you
know, kind of
crate that got
abandoned.
So, you pop
open a crate,
you find some,
uh, some
old, maybe
it's a, maybe
it's a, uh,
maybe it's an
antique warehouse
and you find
some old piece
of metal.
Yep.
And you just
chuck it out
there.
Yep.
Um.
Obviously, the
intent being to
draw them away
from that
building where
he is at.
Um, and
they, um, and
you make a big,
you make a big
racket.
And,
and,
um, they
all, they
all, you
know, jump,
um, kind
of like, what's,
what's going
on?
So, um,
the yellow
and the green
basically signal
to, uh, signal
to purple C
and purple D.
Mm-hmm.
And all four
of them start
moving down,
basically are,
go, go down
that.
All right.
I will let you
move them over
this.
So,
they all
head that,
this direction.
Excellent.
Um,
and as
they're, and as
they're going,
they, like,
the, uh, the
cold, uh,
basically just
calls out to,
um,
A&B and
basically says,
you check that,
check that
storehouse out.
Um,
and they,
they're gone.
A&B continued
to move towards
the store.
And the
seagulls are
still going,
like, it lasts
for a whole
minute.
Okay.
They, yeah,
and, and they
do kind of
look,
they look up
and they are,
they're,
they're kind of
just trying to,
to figure,
to figure,
to figure that
out.
Um, but they
don't see any
seagulls, so
they're just
like, well,
yeah, yeah,
yeah.
So,
B moves up,
A's right
behind,
and he will
pop around
to see
who's in
there.
And he,
he pops
around and he
immediately looks
up to kind of
see if he can
get a better
view of the
seagull.
Uh-huh.
Um, and you
have a minute,
or not a minute,
so you have,
you have a round.
How much time,
it's still within
the minute of
me casting
Thaumaturgy?
It hasn't been
that long,
they're not
moving that
slow?
There,
I, I think
Thaumaturgy has
ended at this
point, because
it takes, it
takes the other
team a while
to kind of
scale, to
kind of move
out.
Um, and
so this
team is just
kind of like
moving in
there.
Has it been
two minutes?
Sure.
Two minutes.
Oh.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Um.
You're expecting
me to be a lot
meaner than I am?
I was expecting
it to actually be
two minutes.
Um, we got
options then.
Oh, yeah.
That's, that's,
that's the winner
right there.
Um, don't need
that anymore.
Mine do you
like?
Because there's
one guy just
about to attack
us.
I don't know.
Do that.
So, I think I
should be attacking
that guy.
So I sort of
have some idea
of what's
happened.
Okay.
That they've
got, I can,
I'm sort of in
the doorway, so I
know that these
guys are sort of
immediate sight.
So, how do I
do that?
Okay, so
Little John's
gonna, is gonna
take a, is gonna
shoot him, shoot
with aim.
Okay, so you're
gonna roll, uh,
so you're gonna
want to roll a
d20.
Um.
This one?
Yep.
And your bonus
action aiming, so
that's your bonus
action.
Your action is to
attack with
your, with
help.
Uh, right.
I don't know
what he's saying.
This is happening
before or after
this happened.
I'm kind of
envisioning this
being a
simultaneous thing.
Yeah, a
simultaneous thing.
I want to get
A and not go
into the door.
My action's
going to matter
for him.
Okay.
So.
He opens the
door, I see
him, I just
kind of wave a
little, and I
cast silence.
Okay.
I like it.
There we go.
Spicy.
I'm gonna shoot
an arrow at it.
Okay.
So.
Now we can start
screaming.
Low one will
cure again.
Yeah.
Um, and if you
flip it over to
your bow, long
bow at the bottom
there, you've got a
plus five, but your
boat, your, your
aim gave you a plus
two on that.
So that's a plus
seven.
So that's a 21 to
hit, which you
totally hit that.
Okay.
Um.
This.
And give me one
piss off.
He's got an arrow
into his shoulder.
Uh, yeah.
And then now you,
uh, so you totally
hit.
So roll your
damage, which
what you've got
right now is
the, okay, so
we're looking at
your damage here.
You've got one D
eight piercing plus
five.
Um, and you
have the, you
have the one plus
one D four for, um,
I forget.
He also, he has the
he has the braces
of archery too.
Yeah.
Which is the plus.
Oh, that's plus
five.
Yeah.
Seven plus three.
So, um, you
roll a D eight and
a D four.
So the D four is
the little pyramid
one.
The D eight is
all those, add
those together and
then add five to
it.
You read the number
on the base of the
D four.
Yeah.
Four.
Oh no, sorry.
Shut it back down.
And there's the
number that's on the
bottom.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Cause those are
the kind of weird
backwards one.
That would be a
two.
No, that's four.
No, that's not
four.
That's two.
Ah, from the
angle, I was like,
yeah, it was a
finger in there.
Where do you see?
Oh, two's on the
bottom of the,
yeah.
Two.
And a three.
Five.
Plus five.
And that's
ten.
Right.
More damage
one hit than I did
off.
Oh, that's
awesome.
Got him.
So I should get
it a ten.
Oh,
all right.
So you,
you get him,
you get him with
your,
you get him with
your arrow.
It's him right in
the,
right in the
shoulder.
he starts,
he starts,
looks like he's
screaming.
Like,
you don't hear
anything.
Yep.
So you all
stop dead.
So now,
let's have
everybody,
yeah,
what's the range
on your side?
20 feet from
this point.
Okay.
So he moves,
so he moves it
off.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Him moving is
not great.
Did you say,
well,
is it a silent
then?
Oh,
anything?
20 feet of this
point.
So everybody,
one,
two,
three,
four,
four.
Yeah.
like that.
Oh,
yeah.
All right.
He was telling
you,
yeah,
roll initiative.
So on the
bottom of
the,
on,
in the combat
section,
there's an
initiative.
That was not
a very high
number.
Oh,
right.
Yeah,
right.
So during
combat,
you've got
initiative.
Okay.
So you roll
d20 and you
add redo.
I think the
answer is.
that I can
capture.
Oh,
they all
require
verbal.
I am
silenced.
Yeah,
yeah,
because they
have verbal
components.
I mean,
you can
move.
I can
move.
Because it's
targeted on
him,
right?
Point
way.
So come.
Yeah.
Well,
I've rolled
better.
I wish
you were
all that.
All right.
I don't
know which
guy.
So,
I mean,
technically
because the
original
family
is
based.
Okay.
So 12.
12,
yes,
okay.
Okay.
Um,
11.
Yep.
And
Xander,
14.
Okay.
I was
going to
need that
information.
But I
did.
Now I
have it.
The stats
I'm
amused.
Oh,
yeah,
you might
need that.
All I
can do.
Right.
Uh,
little
John,
you're up
again.
So you
want to
aim and
shoot
again.
Aim and
shoot.
So you
take this
guy out.
He looks
like he's
screaming,
but I'm
kind of
freaked out
because I
don't know
why he's
not making
any noises.
That's
really
I can
only
reasonably
think that
he's more
dangerous than
I think
because
everybody
else I
would at
least yell
for even
you know,
this guy's
some level
of
I'm
going to
keep my
distance.
I'm going
to shoot
you that
right in
the opposite
shoulder.
All right.
So,
yeah,
roll that
d20 and
then add
seven to
it.
What's he
targeting?
What AC is
he targeting?
13.
He's 20.
So,
AC is
14.
So,
you hit.
No problem.
So,
now you're
rolling the
d8 and
the d4.
It's
1d8
plus 1d4.
Yep,
those two.
Yep,
three of them,
right?
Yep,
and
it's
together and
add a
plus five to
it.
Now,
that's a
four.
Four and
four.
That was
four,
yeah.
So,
that's
eight
plus five
is 13.
So,
you did 13
points of
that.
Get him.
That's
awesome.
Now,
I'm a bit
worried because
this son of
bitch is
still alive.
I shot him
in both
shoulders.
He's sort
of screaming,
but I don't
hear nothing.
I'm getting
freaked out.
He's basically
just staggering
back at this
point.
He's still
alive,
but one
would say
that he
is
very
bloodied
at this
point.
So,
he is
not
looking
good.
Sweet.
Oh.
I love it.
So,
I'm peering
at him
and like,
I don't
understand why
he's not
dead yet,
but okay.
Okay.
Um,
they,
the,
the,
the,
um,
the pirate,
uh,
uh,
walks into
the room.
Yeah,
yeah.
And he's
gonna,
he's gonna
be a
pirate.
Yar.
Yar.
Except he
tries to say
yar,
but he
can't.
No,
he tries to
be a
pirate.
I don't
know me.
All right.
So,
he's going
to make,
he,
he pulls
out two
daggers,
and he's
going at
you with
both of
them.
Yep.
Oh,
I did
have one
other
important
question,
Chris.
Oh,
yeah.
Before all
of this
went down,
was there
enough time
that we
short rested
or no?
Unfortunately,
yeah.
I,
we have
that many
hit points
then.
All right,
cool.
Um,
okay,
so with
this one,
why'd you
throw just
hit points?
Does a,
no,
I,
uh,
I used
a hit die
to heal
thinking we
were going to
have enough
time for a
short rest,
but then we
got interrupted.
does a,
uh,
does a 16
hit.
Oh,
yes.
Okay.
Just a
barely.
He,
uh,
he does,
he gets you
with both
of his
daggers
dealing 10
points of
damage to you.
Oh,
okay.
I'm
still up
barely,
but that's
definitely a
concentration
check.
No,
it's also
fine because
I got the
thing.
Oh,
yeah,
yeah.
Scenes.
God.
I pretty
much only
fail those
on ones,
at least
for these.
You got
twice as
much as
you need
it.
Oh,
yeah.
Twice as
high as
you need
to.
You are
up.
Um,
okay.
Okay.
can I
make
this
move
or
no?
I'll
allow it.
No,
I said,
that's what
I'm going
to do.
I'm going
to move
here.
I'm going
to move
here.
And I'm
going to
like,
I don't
know how,
but try to
get that
guy's
attention.
Maybe he
sees me.
I assume
he kind
of does
like come
out of
there.
I'm not
going to
move any
more
because I
really don't
want to
face an
attack
opportunity
from this
guy.
That seems
poor.
And I'm
going to
try to
smack this
guy with
my mace.
Okay.
And just
just so you
know that
points damage
that was
two
successful
attacks.
It wasn't
one attack.
Oh,
sure.
Sure,
sure.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
So just
so you
I was
hoping you
had like
so I
need to
make two
concentration
checks.
Oh,
yeah,
sorry.
Yeah,
we're good.
I was
hoping you
had arcane
lockers up
and you
were just
going to
close the
door in
his face
and that
would be
pretty good.
All right,
I'm going to
try to hit
this dude
with my
mace.
All right.
That's about
how well that
should have
went.
That's a
seven.
A seven
does not
hit 14.
I did not
expect it to.
I'll take a
luck point
though.
Absolutely.
You're farming
him for luck
points.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That's what
you're doing.
All right,
Arthur.
Um,
so,
well,
that's kind
of a tricky
thing.
Have,
the question
hits,
would Arthur
know anything
is happening?
You have
what?
I have
good ears.
There's
silence.
Like,
maybe he
heard a
bochon.
Maybe.
Okay,
roll
up.
He probably
would have
heard this.
He would
have heard
this crashing
sound over
here,
probably.
Yeah.
So,
like,
the sudden
appearance,
but almost
more so
the,
like,
mid-cry
silencing
of the
seagulls,
also maybe
a bunch of
getting.
Yeah.
Okay,
okay.
I'll allow it.
That makes
sense to me.
Let's go.
You know.
Okay.
I'm gonna go
here.
Okay.
This is a,
this is,
this is,
that's a
window,
you know,
the hole.
I'm gonna
take,
I'm gonna
take my
javelin.
Okay.
One of my
javelins,
and I'm gonna
talk to this
guy.
Right.
See,
that makes
sense,
too,
because you're
talking about
what's going
on,
you're all
walking up to
the window,
like,
what's going
on?
Absolutely.
Oh,
no.
There's a guy
that will keep
my impression.
Let me help.
Roll d20.
Okay,
roll d20.
Let's see if I
can get it.
11 plus
six.
That is a
17,
which does
hit an armor
class of 14.
Pretty good.
So now you're
rolling damage,
which is
1d6
plus
four.
So grab a
d6.
Grab your d6.
Grab a d6.
Duh.
Five.
The Pepto
dice strike
again.
Probably kill
him.
You got
a damage
of five.
You,
you,
this guy,
this poor
guy,
he's got
pin cushions
all over.
Oh,
he's having
a bad day.
He's tearing
it up.
Yeah,
yeah.
He's like,
he just gets,
he got hit
here,
hit here,
then gets a
javelin in the
back,
he kind of
stumbles
forward.
Now he's
just like,
what the hell?
What am I
doing?
I'm getting
really worried.
Look at this
guy,
he is flailing
around like a
fish.
and I can't
hear anything
he's doing.
No,
I don't
understand if
I'm gone
deaf.
Me clearly.
And on top of
that,
I think my
good friend
here is in
serious trouble.
Yep.
Oh,
that's true.
Clearly,
you have gone
deaf because
you would at
least have heard
the thunk of
the javelin.
Right?
Yeah.
You were up.
what time
of days?
I just
lost him.
Daylight
during
40,
45.
It is
early.
Sorry.
Um,
and Dave,
also,
I'm,
I'm running
the true,
I'm running
the solid
fifth edition
movement rules.
Okay.
Diagnals are
five.
Okay.
The star
wagons are
five,
10,
15,
20,
25,
30,
35.
All right.
Well,
I guess it's a
good thing I
have javelins.
Well,
don't you have
fast movement
because you're
a barbarian?
maybe not.
Yeah,
I think so.
I think,
I think it's a
level five thing,
but the book is
under Ramsey's
sack of dice.
So I don't know
for sure.
Okay.
I don't think I
do.
I think fast
movement is
mostly a monk
thing,
right?
No,
barbarians get
fast movement,
but they don't
get like fast
movement,
fast movement,
fast movement.
Right.
Oh,
okay.
But they do
get a fast
movement.
Fast movement,
no,
level five.
Yeah.
So that's fine.
That's fine.
I've got javelins.
We can do,
we can do
dexterity rolls.
It's fine.
Well,
javelins are
straight.
Oh,
even better.
Even better.
Even better.
So we're going
to poke out
here.
Okay.
And we're
going to throw
a javelin at
his neck.
All right.
I'm not going
to bother to
rage or anything
because you
get that
nonsense.
That would
be an eight
plus proficiency
is 10 plus
it's going to
be a 15.
15 hits 14.
Excellent.
Yeah.
All right.
And that's
just a D6
plus strength,
which by my
count,
it should be
seven damage.
Right.
How do you
want to have
killed him?
Well,
a javelin
through the
neck will
kill someone
pretty effectively
and he would,
he would do a
whole lot of
gurgling.
Yep.
He would do a
lot of gurgling,
but he's not
doing any of
it.
He does like
the cat thing.
You see like
blood spewing
out and
splashing on
the ground.
Nothing.
Dead silence.
Oh,
there's
witchy shit
going on over
there.
I don't like
it.
I like this.
I may have a
slight retcon.
Oh,
what's that?
Are healing
potions bonus
actions?
They are.
Yeah,
I have a
bonus action.
That's smart.
my second
and last
healing potion.
I'm going
to,
they're down
this way.
I'm going
to,
so I did
five,
10,
15,
20,
25.
I'm going
to get
behind.
I'm going
to hide
behind this
statue.
Okay.
Just in
case,
like if they
start coming
back,
I want to
be somewhat
hidden,
but I want
to also be
moving towards
whatever the
fuck's going
on over
there.
Fair enough.
Skirk
don't do
quiet.
Okay.
So Skirk,
you like,
you don't see
them like
they're off in
the distance,
but you do
see the,
well,
you saw
them before.
You saw
them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
So you see
them off in
the distance,
but they're not
they're clearly
not knowing
what's happening.
Yep.
All right.
And
that's
dead.
So we
got
little
John.
So you
got a
dead
pirate.
That's
kind of
all wonky.
We're at
one,
two,
three,
four.
I get to
here,
right?
Oh,
yeah.
You probably
have 30
feet of
movement,
so you're
probably
totally.
I'm going
to go
approach
him.
Okay.
And I'm
also going
to check
his body
for anything
worthwhile.
strip
surgery
quickly.
Still
don't
know
why
there's
no
noise.
As
I'm
as I
am
bottling
this guy
for his
jewelry
and stuff
and or
weapons,
I don't
hear anything.
I'm getting
really freaked
out.
well,
the moment
you get
about within
five feet
of him,
like,
you don't
make any
noise either.
Oh,
yeah.
Why,
why is
everything so,
have I gone,
I'm trying to
think,
did I get
like a
flashbang or
did something
catch my
hearing?
As we get
to that
spot also,
you're able
to see
Xander
there,
and Xander
is clearly
in the
throes of
comics.
With a
dude.
I'm glad
to see him
is alive.
Yep.
I also have
no idea
why it's so
quiet.
So I am
trying to
convince him
that I have
my bow and
stuff.
Okay.
But I don't
have a way
to initiate
that.
Are you
okay?
You're
supposed to
steal
a second
bounce now.
I'm pretty
sure I know
there's a guy
there based
on his
reactions.
I don't
really know
the status
of him.
He's in a
building,
right?
Yeah.
Well,
that's true.
Cause like,
I mean,
you see him
like swinging
his mace
and you're
like,
shit's gone
horribly wrong
and Xander
swinging his
mace.
Yeah.
You kind of
see like
a couple of
like arms
coming out
from behind
there,
but you don't
actually see
the guy.
You just
see like,
there's like
clearly Xander
is finding
somebody.
That's about
all you know.
Okay.
I'll see you
that's probably
right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
i see you're a war cleric now yeah
cleric of war
let's see he doesn't have bonus action so he's just gonna i like it my way he's gonna
try and stab you twice and then excellent stay all right sick
do you have a way of pushing it oh not so much not with no verbal components he doesn't
with no strength modifier and no proficiency in athletics just just run around behind him and
push him out the door right right it's okay we'll get there we'll get there we'll be fine
you just gotta hold out a little longer i don't know i know exactly what i'm doing on my turn yeah
all right speaking of it is your turn oh sick uh i'm taking the disengage action uh-huh
oh five ten fifteen
twenty we'll move here actually we'll get behind the the statue and we'll move
there and as i'm moving like i'm gonna like
can i offer him a healing potion like no just like hand it off yeah like a like a
why not um it's cooler though if you throw it in the air and he catches it as he rolls
by oh they have to roll a desk
that's like the rule is cool chris rule is cool
i'm gonna like try to feign like i'm you know scared except i'm so damaged i think i actually am
well we yeah we we take a move because i want to draw
him this way rather than that way but i i'm pretty sure that's the way he's gonna come
that way
grant's burning it up
so you get a healing potion
and you could all right your bonus action right then and there
oh down it
good i don't even wait to though
fair enough
all right arthur you're up
okay so this is the end of running away from something
and he's looking who the what's my what could not great you can move six squares um which is 30 feet
can i go for this window i would allow it yeah okay how much more
how much more what okay i'm going through this when you go through the window you hear big loud crash
okay
if i go to the window i will get crash yeah i mean there's no silent spell right there and you're
going through a window yep stop you know
i mean you're in you're pretty big yeah it's probably not gonna be the loudest crash in the
world but it's gonna make noise noise yeah i do not want to make noise
one two three four five six and i'm gonna ready in action okay if he comes out i'm going i'm going
to throw another javelin i'm going to throw a javelin at him uh do you have a range for a javelin from
that far out um like 30 feet 30 feet three feet out okay depends on where he comes out yeah i think
he's in okay one two three four five six yeah i mean pretty much any exception that building i think
is going to be 5 10 18 20 25 30 yeah yeah so any accent from that building is going to unless he comes
out like here yeah okay cool cool cool um also in you do have the ability now the javelin is good
and just stick stick with that i'm not trying to convince you to do something else but i do just
want to let you know that you do have the ability to spend an action to dash which would allow you to
move a second time so um that is that is something that everybody always has that ability to do
not very many people choose to do that because you know moving for an action is a pretty bad trade
unless you need to be honest all right uh so you hold your action you're you're waiting for him to show
up yeah uh and skirk what's good skirk ain't smart enough to stand out here and wait for this guy
five ten fifteen five ten where's the where is the actual door into this place it's right behind
him i'm sorry and this is like a porch area yeah it's just like it's a curve okay five ten fifteen
twenty twenty five you can get straight to him wait no i can't five ten fifteen twenty twenty five yes we can
yeah uh i believe he needs to be smacked and now he's not going to come out of the room and do you
attack him that's fine you don't kill him in the quiet maybe not try maybe not oh that's right i
forget i can recklessly attack even without it without rage yes i'm absolutely recklessly attacking we
don't do things non-recklessly you also have you also have your luck points too that's true yeah
i do have my luck points to this attack if i guess if i get enough how does the rule work like if i get
too many i have to eat some of them into oblivion yeah so if you if you get five and you get a sixth
one you have to roll a d4 and you are in you end up with that many levels oh no i'm not going to spend
one yet then we're just gonna miss i mean what we miss what was our ac 14 uh four plus seven
is eleven plus one is twelve i'll just spend two of these and hit that's fine okay yeah that's fine
yeah yeah that's a hit they're there four yep and d8
that one plus
five plus a six that's uh twelve points of damage
the liquor yeah yeah it's kind of good it's almost like a
uh sure sure sure nope yeah yeah nice
minus 12 all right so you smack him with your uh with your new new improved plus one flail yep and uh he
um
he gets knocked back a little bit but still
mm-hmm
so
and then we're up to a little gun
so i am
i'm a bit confused because i don't know why my i handed a potion to my teammate he didn't seem to
take it but he's behind me well my other teammates i don't know he's trying to engage i guess yeah
everything is still quiet i don't know why i can't hear myself even breathe
so i don't know if i'm sort of starting to realize but am i even a lie
skirk definitely made a little freak out when he walked into the silence
oh
to be fair though you also have grown up in a in a magical world where magical unexplainable
ones do yeah yeah from here so it wouldn't be the biggest freak out in the world but it might
still be a freak out so i have a question chris i was in here yeah and i was able to see them
does it stand to reason that there is a chance that little john can see him it does stand to
reason that there's a chance okay all right that's that is a good point um if you wish to attack
if you wish to try and attack him from where you are you can see him through like cracks in the in
the wall um which means that you would be able to attack him with disadvantage if you wanted to
and what that means is you roll 2d20 and then you just take the lower of the two blows
oh for your attack well something no yep which definitely beats sitting out here waiting for him
to leave because he's not gonna he's not getting out of that room
i got you for three minutes if it takes three minutes i need to quit
right however
yeah right you're the you've got all the
advanced capability of short-range attack right oh yeah yeah so i don't want to gauge him too quick
i want to stay in the outskirts so i got my bow so what i'm gonna do is i'm actually going to just
move kind of back one so i'm still in range oh yeah and i scan this back of the area to make sure
those guys have three showed up or anything yep they are blissfully unaware of what's happening and
excellent excellent can't really do much else can attack it we'll win for looking for one price
i will try to shoot all that right for lack of that to be that
call do i lose my when he comes out uh yeah no you you would yeah um but i would at this point
at this point he's not coming out so yeah i wouldn't count out so it's just a d20 to see
what i roll yeah so roll that and then nine okay and then roll it again oh disadvantage
13. okay so we're gonna use the nine but you know you're good no i mean i'm i hope i'm not putting
more in your mouth but i'm assuming you're using your bonus action to aim right so that's a plus seven
to your hit so a nine plus seven 16 beats 14 you still hit it sure i got my bullet point two dice
deal because the hunters get mystic mark for free hunter don't suck in this right
and it was nine so nine plus five that's solid uh-huh so that's 14.
and he doesn't even have a plus one weapon i know
i do it do you realize how terrible my next rolls are last game
he's got he's got his bracelet roll out he's got his braces of all tree which are adding damage
this is great this is great i'm pointing out that you don't even have a magic weapon yeah yeah
which is awesome so great job although the twilight firework that nuclear bomb
so your so your your um your arrow just goes straight through the crack right into him knocks him back
here he stumbles back he's still alive but he's not looking good at all um and it's his time
i'm also you're right it is his time
he's probably aware of it too yeah he's very aware of it so let's see
he is going to we set him up the base
all your base um he's not going to stay where he's at he's not going to just
fight to the death he does not want to die no uh so okay so he is going here and attempt to run away
smack yeah oh he got smacked oh is that a 120 that is a 120.
uh let's roll that crit damage so i want to see what happens here all right do i double
does i i forget do i double the dice or do i double the value you double the dice okay yeah so it's 2d8
plus five plus yeah plus five
seven 10 plus five 15 points of damage 15 points of damage all right how do you do this so he starts
to walk away from me and like yes i know the flail is at a reach weapon but we'll we'll swing it out
and it kind of like catches him in the like whips around and catches him in the face and i just pull
him back and it like yelp oh eggs his head nice love it he might have gotten to the edge of the
coat his eye out there so maybe he let out a little whimper of a scream that happened i don't know
exactly where the silence was maybe not it was right here it was like there's 20 feet from this point oh
okay all right well i have successfully defeated the two pirates
excellent um and made pretty short work of them yeah all things considered you were not
necessarily in the best positions yeah no did that have anything on them that sucked i don't know
we're gonna chase them go how dead bodies can we see the books or are they out of sight at this point
um at this point they they're still within sight um they are moving that direction um
arthur go ahead and roll a dc 12 perception skirk will come out of the building he he covered in gore
um oh 20 okay awesome um all right so they are about 200 feet away so pretty far
um chasing after whatever it was yeah yeah skirk threw out there um
okay all right all right you recognize the cold what the kobold
is is your childhood friend keorix oh whoopsie doodle
the one that decided to go the wrong direction and you couldn't say no pirate
so
okay
what are you saying who's the captain of that in that crew uh well he's definitely a position of
authority i wouldn't necessarily think that he's the captain though um
xander yes is going to drop concentration on silence uh and it's going to walk up to the bodies
and just kind of like kneel down beside it and use fire bolt to burn the bodies okay
it's like
oh
okay uh so you you successfully
i'm not having someone's track of there's anything valuable on them but i'm just concerned about them
coming back
yep uh so what you did you did find pouches of gold on them all right there are other like i mean
they've got daggers they've got leather armor you know that kind of stuff nothing nothing of
any real significance um but the gold that you find on them is of is
600 gold so everybody gets 150 if you split it up i'm so rich
770 750
so what can i do with this goal later on uh you can buy magic weapons if we are if we survive
you can buy it out of here yes so what's the what's the what's the to buy all that risky
so what was your goal that before uh 600 670 i believe i did i'm not mistaken oh that was a one i
had six to six ten is more likely uh so well i was at six i was at 600 so yeah and he had he started
with 10 gold yeah um being anointed so um so that'd be 760 that's what you're at yeah yeah so um yeah but
as far as like what you can do with gold like there are potions there are magic items there
armor and different things that you can purchase so
which if you decide to leave the tide watch board there are jobs that are available to you
if they let us leave the tide watch board yeah you you might in fact find shops here as well but
there they would definitely be um anomalies yes yes um okay so you guys kind of finish finish things up um
after um a few minutes like yeah after a few minutes like you guys are kind of paying attention
to what's happening with the guys that are over there uh they start being harried by arrows
and they kind of start booking it yeah uh sweet so the uh the coral mart yeah yeah weren't just
sitting around watching you guys do yeah they made sure that they took care of you the rest they got
the books yeah yeah uh the elf um returns after a few minutes
what's the question says well you definitely don't appear to be useless um
wow
okay
these these are these are military guys they they're frightful
yeah yeah um it's just the way it is um he's like um
so we've been we've been watching you for a bit
um
and you thought we were pirates
you came out of the you came out of the pirate haunt
okay fair enough fair enough
um
why don't you come with us we'll give you a lay of the land
and uh he turns starts walking you guys can choose to do whatever you want at that point
uh
just kind of shrug and walk yeah yeah that's not the closest that you'll get to an invitation
nope yeah welcome no we like the guy
mm-hmm
like useless come up where is he first things in here that didn't try to kill us
yeah that's close enough to probably
as we're walking like i'm obviously i've worked in the area for a while can i get a sense of where
he's taking us yeah
so
um
he's kind of like giving
a little bit of a um
the kind of the direction that you guys were headed in the south he's giving back kind of a wide berth
um the center of the of the tide watch ward um is um kind of like you you see it on the horizon and it's
a giant temple to um
i want to say minerva but that's not right marine
moraine thank you
just the deity that i made up i can't remember anything but um
it's uh it's a giant temple to moraine it's at the center um of of the tide watch board um and
it appears that that's kind of like what they're um they're kind of moving away from that um and
they're moving back towards the um towards the wall um
um so you get a little bit closer to where the where the wall is it takes about two three hours um get
where he takes you um and there is kind of like this area where you see a bunch of like rubble and
some and some sheets and planks and things that are just kind of like going over like a big pile of rubble
um and he moves um one of the one of the pieces of sheet metal which opens up into a um an entrance and he kind
of like hobbles inside
now you're gonna follow him kind of well yeah i you're still like flipping around right a little
better do it a little better now i assume somewhere in there i could use a hidden item
yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm doing okay yeah your your short rest you can have had a short rest while
doing this because as i said before short there are any reason bringing two nights i'm gonna use my
average heel today oh you're what now yeah i don't know it's just the guy does though you get plus
all the con spell uh probably save it like in general they're better like in battle like if someone
actually drops um or do you get really right so it's your head that i lost it you're gone
for now i'm all right all right i've had i need the long rest soon i'm out of hit dice
well as you as you enter into this area it's basically kind of
you see a number of different people that are in various states of the same sort of yeah position
that this guy's in um their mutations are different but they all have mutations you know um it's kind of
like uh yeah it's kind of like uh pirates that's just that sort of monstrosity sort of thing happening
um but it's all but all the mutations are coral related like it's like just coral started developing on their skin
um but they look different from time to time uh you um in this place it's kind of like um
it's like a sewer sort of situation i don't know if you guys at all remember like i'm eating this is way
before your time but um well no i'm wearing them yeah no i was i i was thinking more along the beauty
and the beast uh television show where there was a beauty it was it was a 90s sitcom sort of thing where
they lived in a sewer underneath and it was like uh it was like an under city stories
wow was it this was a kansas thing was this a live action show it was i think i remember this yeah yeah
this is how mass hallucination starts and suddenly you're there was a cornucopia in there somewhere
his name was vincent very vague memories but yeah yeah yeah okay so regardless it's it's you're in an
under city situation okay so it's not like a sewage yeah thing it's like there are hovels and and
and you know that kind of a thing yep um as you as you go in this place is it's not large it's
well it's about the size of maybe a building or so as he as you walk in um
or as you as you've been traveling the uh the coral marked um captain that was talking to you
introduces himself as varic thorn um he was the captain of the guard of the tide watch ward when
everything happened um and he had basically been here for the past six months um trying to protect the
rest of the city um with any of the iron tide regiment that was sent in or that was there when when the
initial attack yeah um he lets you know that this is one of many sites they don't they they have
um effectively cells that they that they do they're all pretty well aware of where everything is but
they don't have just one place um this is just one of them most of them are closer to the wall but they
do have one or two places that are a little bit further into the board um
he takes you into a into a uh a room uh that has more of like a a map of of the area um
um and he says well if you if you want to survive here you at least need to know the lay of the land
i know that you've been sent to uh free the ward and that may be something that
we can help you with but um
um the thing that we for sure can help you with is knowing where to be and where not to be
the area that you're in right now that is wrote that is like within the first
two to three miles of the of the wall um is heavily patrolled by me and my people
we make sure that no monsters make it close to the wall and those that do are things that the
people at the wall can handle um everything else beyond there is um relatively difficult for um
for outsiders to be able to view to the northwest near the dunks
which is which is the direction that you appear to be heading um there is the um
the docked workers
um
the dock hands um
um somehow six months ago when the catastrophe occurred which i watch war catastrophe online
the automatons that were working the docks
gained sentience and are now it's not nice some of us already had sentience
and are and now protecting the docks um
uh as religiously um nothing living is allowed in in the docks had you gone just
a few miles north um you would have been on set by these by these golems and
i don't think that you would have survived
to the south um
the uh the the what we call the pearl bound which are the dead that have been
raised by some power that appear to be um spending
or patrolling as your friend may have placed may have said earlier um appeared to be patrolling about a
two-mile radius of the uh temple of moraine
uh south of that
uh we have the stormcaller cult from which you've already met a few of them um
um they uh only recently have started getting those that that viciage that that you saw those those
creep them to have before that they were just normal people um although they did have mutations like we do
now their mutations have been developing more uh more demonic viciages uh
and that it's uh
and and they have been moving towards the temple of moraine as well um that that uh
uh ritual that you saw them doing um isn't the first time that they've attempted something um they
are attempting to draw the pearl marked away from whatever it is that they're whatever it is that's in
the temple of moraine that they want and then there are the tide cutters uh from which you
have from which we just met as well um they are a pirate group that has been
um sorting into the tide watch war they don't stay here they don't have
a they don't have a foothold um but they appear to be searching for something uh
i would be concerned that they are that they they appear to be interested in one of your number
uh and have been uh and they've been tracking you uh so i would keep an eye out for them as well
uh but their ship is off off the western off the western coast of the board
oh
that's the monthly war
i don't think we got to back at the end
any of them with your mutations
no
they don't stay that long
they they do not um and even if they did like
they may have figured out some sort of trick here uh your compatriot mentioned some sort of cure
we don't know of anyone but we've been up to our necks just trying to keep
new pemeris alive we don't have time to worry about the inconvenience of
uh mutation hearing pattern
does this kind of gesture to the tunnels broadly lead back into the city
no
good we do not we made sure that all entrances and exits into the actual city itself were collapsed
uh we cannot have the horrors of this ward um make it into the city itself
oh
this feels like this feels like a demonic curse
now thinking about it
very well maybe i don't know
is there any sea devils i'm asking you and do i know any sea devils that could possibly want to
and they see
no it feels like a whole lot of weird magic going on
i don't like it it feels like we gotta go south of the
one one group of people are trying to to attack the other group of people that are
treating the statue what do you call that uh the temple of minerva so the marine marine
why do i well if we travel south of that to clear out those monsters
i also wish to clear that out i have a much more sleep all this information is great
i have a much more pressing question yes where how do you sleep
um there there are a number of different barracks that that we that we stay in um if you are tired
you are more than welcome to stay here with us um you will be safe
in any one of our in any one of our locations
um how many of you are there
uh well our numbers change day to day um in the height of them sending the iron um
the uh iron iron tide regiment in um our numbers were pushing that of 100 to 150
um but we have dwindled since um we're right around 50 strong at this point and when
we die we will become like them
there are about a hundred of them out there is what you're telling me
oh more than that all the inhabitants yeah
the uh the the temple of moraine is very well guarded
uh this is about the time that i would tell either jeseric something about his compass pointing towards
the temple of the temple of moraine um or uh sprigle sprocket about his uh about how his treasure map
appears to be pointing in that general direction as well um for which you guys would all have that
yeah yeah yeah and we do still have that information uh-huh um but you just have to fourth wall it a little bit
i just have yeah do we also one other question have you seen a big demon wandering around
because somebody sent me in here to look for that thing too and well
i haven't seen it yet but i'm pretty short so i don't always see everything i well
how long ago was that demon so i don't know arthur i don't know arthur how long ago was that about
a month about a month that's where i got the information well that would explain a lot um
the single color just recently started um having those demonic um horns and different
males that they were growing and their skin would start turning so it's possible that it would be
in tact with that demon which is what's giving them that that power well that seems bad
okay that's good to know i'd like to wondering what what was causing that causing that change because
those mutations don't look at anything like anything else that we've been doing well that's probably it
so we have to deal with the cult obviously we have to you should deal with the cult first because
they're going to be the most big biggest problem here
i
my hat's off to you if you want to if you want to take them on um there are many of them they take up
the entire southeastern corridor of the of the of the ward
i have another really important question what do y'all eat
fish mostly
it's it's safe enough to get to the places where you could fish
fish because the docks are you know infested with automatons and you can't really go there and
right um no we do we do have a like they they don't have the automatons don't control the entire
coast oh okay they just control the dock okay so there's we have um a roughly a four mile stretch
of coast that would have that is not that's not um
claimed by any
okay
it's still dangerous but
best we can do
this all seems like a shitty situation all right so you need to speak here and then
do you want a break for the south of this would you call it the
you know the temple scene you know it marks the spot but i don't be able to get through all the
whole the whole the whole horde of um what do they call them yeah the zombies figure it out
orborn baby uh it's the pearl uh coral bull coral marked are the are the iron tide regiment that have
been zombified the pearl bound are the uh are the so the room was sleep okay
okay yes
all we have the option yes because who knows we will have the option again
to curse to writing on us um well you don't know that um
the only thing that you the only thing that like if you ask if they like the the pearl bound themselves
do not carry any thing that enhances the curse or anything they're not they're not they're not true
zombies okay they're zombies but they're not zombies they're zombie-esque
um they the pearl bound the pearl bound themselves are only um are just um corpses that have been
overgrown by coral and are being controlled by something okay they're like a hive mind sort of thing
we are the borg yeah so if we attack one one of them are if we go in there and attack one they're
going to do a horde they want to go into that area and attack us so so
they're going to go into the cold because they probably have something to some they they
they have some idea what what's it what tracks that we can might you yeah uh you you could do that
um i mean it's not bad idea i say we follow the map
and hope we don't die yeah so ian just so you know there's not a right answer here
you have thought you have three different factions that you have to deal with there's this there's a
center there's a center um lot something having to do something with the temple of marine okay so
that's kind of where everything is pointing the the the cult is trying to get to the temple marine
the pirates here to be trying to find trying to find mistral you did see writings about a pearl
that were that were talked about before as well mistral's maps are pointing towards
the temple of the temple okay okay so you got at least one faction and two artifacts that are pointing
towards this yeah and they they were correct me if i'm wrong chris they were trying to use
that weird lightning ritual they were doing to draw the coral born away from the temple right yeah
yeah so there was something about like ace about the elementals like thunder light storm that was
attracting the that was attracting the world okay and we were far enough away from the temple that the
idea of that was to draw them away from the temple yeah yeah yeah well that's a bad idea oh we got nothing
about bad ideas well um wait wait maybe maybe we can find a way to must guard to hide our sense or
something to disguise ourselves to sneak past them maybe maybe the buildings in this ward are they mostly
stone or mostly wood this combination um mostly wood but there are there are a few stone buildings um they
we did only have like six months of reconstruction before this happened so um there weren't a lot of stone
buildings is it enough wood guys and are they closing impact are you
you better yeah to feasibly create a great chicago fire situation
oh um that was a better idea than my idea oh no it's a much worse idea well
yes and no i guess it's the best way
yeah okay um this this entire like you there's definitely enough wood to create a chicago fire
situation you wanted to yeah how started however this this entire this entire area is covered by storm
clouds yeah and receives a lot of precipitation so wood itself is kind of soaked yeah so if you can
figure out a way to figure out a way of actually creating a fire that will be able to kind of like
dry out the wood yeah and spread it at the same time from which
then it started out maybe magic because big enough magical fire okay yeah big enough magical fire would
totally accomplish it excellent no that's not a plan
yeah
me might hadn't graduated yet to a to plan status yet that is um that is the last result yeah yeah yeah
yeah um
what that pirate boat has
Dave has an idea
but Skirk isn't smart enough
Skirk is smart enough
but Dave is not sure how to phrase it
in the way that Skirk would phrase it
so they were doing this ritual
this magic glowy crystal ball thing
they've probably done that ritual more than once
I would assume
like
maybe enough people have seen it
where it's potentially recreatable
and I've got a lot of energy from that crystal ball
just hanging out right here
I'm just saying
I could be a walking beacon
and we could take them wherever the hell we want them to go
so you're proposing you Piper
I didn't say it was a good idea
yes
didn't say it was a good idea
or that I know how to do it
but in theory it's an idea
yeah
that could work
it's not
their numbers are usually
so great
yeah
we've never had a point here
but also I don't really feel like I was shutting you down
about the
about the cult
because the cult in and of itself
it's got the demon you guys are looking for
you know it's definitely
it's definitely something that you can pursue
the main concern with the cult is there are a lot of them
so
and they're not mindless creatures like the Pearlbound are
so you would have to walk in with a pretty steady
okay so
hidden run tactics
uh
oh I'm sorry
maybe
depends on how you do the hidden run tactics
because
again
intelligent creatures
intelligent creatures
being led by a demon
could be uh
could be difficult
hey
well
I vote
first sleep
then decision
yep
yep
yep
yeah
not just sleep
yeah
it's 24 hours
24 hours of
time to like plan
so you guys
so you guys bed down
yep
you get yourself a long rest
yep
um
so
as we're
sorry as we're going to
like as we're getting ready
and bedding down for the
for the evening or day
or whatever it is
like
if you're paying any sort of attention
at all
you like you notice
Skirk like
meticulously checking himself
to see if there's any
like
does that look normal
yes
he's being very paranoid
about it
all right
very cool
um
also like
when we're going over
like
just
I'm not expecting
a huge long explanation
but I would like to know
how you spend your down time
what you do
to refresh
um
you know
for those of you
familiar with
Blades in the Dark
it's
it's the whole
like
you know
what
um
what's your
vice is
or whatever
you know
it's like
something that you do
to basically
recenter
and refocus
and relax
and prepare
for
the next thing
so
nothing
you know
again
doesn't have to be a big thing
it can be like
I like to
play
hidden in cyber
it can be whatever
um
but I just want to get a feel
for what your character
likes to do
yeah
yeah
yeah
um
why don't we start off
with Ramsey
uh
Xander
so
uh
thing one
I think before we
sleep that night
Xander
would
approach
but
who would he
respect the most
here
probably Arthur
Xander would
approach Arthur
um
and say
promise me
if I fall
you burn
me
I do not
want to be
one of those
yes sir
um
and then
for my
down time
I'm going to
spend
the entirety
of my time
talking
to
the people
here
the choral
marked
specifically
I am
recording
in whatever
I have
uh
scroll
or book
or whatever
uh
name
and
their
family
with
the
intention
of
if
I
make it
out of
here
or one
of us
makes it
out of
here
I can
at least
tell your
family
that you
lived
or what
happened
all right
uh
you are
definitely
able to
do that
you will
also
uh
there are
a couple
things
uh
one
you
you
definitely
get a
kind
of like
there
were
some
of
these
people
that
tried
to
return
yeah
but
they
were
effectively
like
assumed
to be
monsters
and
chased
away
from
them
so
they
so
there
there's
a little
bit
of like
sore
hurt
feelings
and
stuff
around
that
um
and
kind
of like
just
more
of a
feeling
of like
worthlessness
because
they
went
to
their
people
and
their
people
rejected
them
sure
sure
uh
and
with
my
all
of
my
eight
charisma
sander's
response
would be
like
that's
good
none
of us
can
leave
it is
too
big
of a
risk
if
one
of
us
gets
out
it
could
doom
the
entire
city
yep
the best
case
for us
all
is a
giant
pyre
fun
guy
oh
yeah
just
because
he's
just
because
he's
a
fun
guy
doesn't
mean
he's
not
a
fun
guy
that's
uh
i'm
trying
not
to
be
fun
you're
over
here
that
zombification
you
and
you
do
actually
also
oddly
enough
oh
bother
you
do
run
into
you
do
run
into
your
fishing
he's
actually
he's
actually
in
this
specific
place
um
he
was
abducted
by
the
cultists
but
um
the
coral
mark
uh
saved
him
before
they
were
able
to
do
whatever
it
was
they
did
with
him
but
not
before
he
started
developing
the
symptoms
and
he's
been
with
them
um
he's
one
of
their
he's
one
of
their
better
fishermen
in
yeah
that's
racks
yeah
uh
all right
uh
dave do
you have
a thought
about
yeah
what
skirk
would
do
for
so
skirk
is
immediately
like once
we kind
of come
into this
place
he
you see
him almost
relax a
little bit
like he's
more comfortable
in
in under
city in
sort of
this underground
environment
because he
spent his
his youth
sort of
in the
underbelly
of pen
mars
working the
forges
working
all the
mechanical
bits
and fixing
stuff
like
yeah
this is
just
this is
the closest
anything has
felt like
home to
him
almost
since he's
even since
new pen
maris
yeah
um
yeah
and so
he spends
his downtime
he likes
to
he mentally
returns to
his roots
he likes
to
tinker
and work
with his
hands
so he
spends his
downtime
like
just kind
of
probably won't
have any
mechanical
impact or
effect but
he's like
walking around
and like
just fixing
random
things
shoring up
the foundations
of the
doors and
things that
are keeping
this place
secure
and casting
amending
every once
in a while
and just
staying busy
almost
meditatively
working with
his hands
awesome
Arthur
um
um
I'm
um
Arthur's
downtime
he
basically
he
basically
when he
takes off
his armor
he
basically
um
and he
sees
he sees
how the people
live here
and
he
simply
he simply
reminds himself
of what
he broke
and how
he grew up
and
he basically
he basically
has a weird
sense
he uses
himself
for the people
okay
like
to have
conversation
and talk
to people
okay
basically
it's been
maybe
about two
years
since he
actually
done this
so
since
since he
has some
really
downtime
sure
okay
cool
awesome
so you
basically
just kind
of
mingle
around
and
get to
get to
know
the people
this is a
little bit
different than
kind of
what you're
what you're
used to
because you're
used to
hanging out
in squalor
with
with a
bunch of
a bunch
of like
families
and that
kind of
stuff
and what
you're
what you're
dealing with
right now
is primarily
military
or
military
or military
age
men and
women
so
they're not
really families
they're like
more wretched
but definitely
does have
that vibe
that you're
that you know
that you're
used to
so
it's kind
of
meandering
right now
yeah
oh go ahead
no that makes
sense
right
uh
little john
you have
so
i'm hungry
so i
i think
they have
some great
fish heads
too
i am
i'm loving
the fish heads
too
and it's doing
so i'm talking
to the cook
yeah
of the fish
head
and one
of the hunter
and one
of the fishermen
and kind
of
and
and
uh
but most
only
i'm one
hungry
orc
and i'm
a seven
foot
big
motherfucker
and i
want
all right
so you
you're
just
chowing
down
just
feasting
on as
much as
they can
give
you
all right
jason do
you have
an idea
about what
misero would
do for
fun
oh
so he
does have
some artist
supplies
i think
he would
tend to
if he's
going to
try and
relax
for an evening
and if he
might try
and uh
put together
just
like what i
have in my
head is kind
of like the
courthouse
sketches
you know
those quick
little like
try to capture
what everybody's
doing just
try to help
document
definitely not
eating any
fish heads
it is it
is their
specialty it
is delicious
that's what
everybody raves
about yeah
it's that it's
that or the uh
or the chunk
deal it's that
a lukewarm
clam chowder
no no that's
good that's
good all right
so everybody
you've officially
completed a long
rest that means
all your points are
back up to full
any spells that
you've cast you
have access to
any other long
rest any anything
else that
refreshes at a
short rest or a
long rest you now
have so ryan you've
got your mystic
mark stuff back
um dave you got
your i can rage
again
got all the
spells i guess i
had one more
rage i could have
used which is good
then there's got
spells
uh for um
marker you
your um
laying on hands
refreshes
the spells you
have refresh
yep
excuse me
yep
okay
so after a
day of just
kind of
commuting with
the people and
that kind of
thing uh you
feel refreshed and
ready to to take
on that next that
next um level um i
will need everybody
to make comp saves
though yeah um i
am i don't think
this is gonna matter
even a little bit
uh but i'm gonna
try as hard as i
can to make it a
point and let
everybody know
that uh before we
eat or drink
anything um i'm
gonna ritually
pass purify food
and drink on it
okay just in
case yeah i don't
know i have no
evidence to believe
that that's what's
causing it but just
in case i'm gonna do
it yep and the uh
the dc's that you're
looking for the
number that you're
looking to roll um
is going to be um
11 at this point
for cob save we're
rolling the save
20 all right yep
roll the 20 and
add your constitution
save modifier which
will be the one
above
yep
three
yep
you said 11
11
well
damn it
well well well
wait
20
20
20 okay
i actually i actually
got 11
yeah got that
yeah got 11
11 is good
enough so
um all right so
for those of you
that got an 11
or higher
nothing happens
yeah um for
those of you
who
um well
ian
arthur continues to
have that like
gave to me
that itchy rash
on his neck
but nothing
nothing progresses
at that
um
zander
well i'm pretty
sure i failed
too i'm just
double checking
a few things
but okay
oh yeah
oh no we
failed
okay i got
nothing else
here yep
that's a big
old fail
so zander
you actually
um
you wake up
the next day
and you see
uh discoloration
on your forehead
where your
blue skin
is actually
starting to
turn more
of a pale
more of a
pale-ish
purple
um
like right
on your
forehead
yeah
yeah
sick
you got
that shaled
oh yeah
y'all sure
do
just look
in the
lash
uh-huh
not that
shaled
get some
shea butter
you're fine
y'all
all right
cool
uh so
that is
uh that's
all the
bookkeeping
that we need
so what
where do you
guys want to
where do you
guys want to
start
next
uh
hmm
i would say
try a way
final
in my opinion
we should
try a way
to sneak
in
basically
try to find
a way
to disguise
ourselves
like
to them
disguise
ourselves
as one event
the central
which
the pearl
you want to
disguise yourself
as a pearl
bound
and try
and infiltrate
them
yeah
that
or go
to the demon
try and get
to the demon
okay
anybody else
have any
thoughts
i think
xander's
primary
concern
is actually
that boat
the pirates
i don't
cry
that boat
needs to
not exist
how
because it
is an
existential
threat
to everything
everything
else in here
is contained
but if
someone
gets
this
and gets
on that
boat
and goes
somewhere
else
that's
very bad
skook's
priority
is
also
the pirates
for a
different
reason
okay
two different
reasons
stop
uh
it's got
booty
i know
this
no
uh
specifically
because
skook doesn't
like being
hunted
and
yeah
one of our
parties being
hunted by
these pirates
and i don't
like that
like if we're
trying to deal
with all this
other bullshit
the last thing
i want is
pirates dropping
it in an
inopportune time
again
again
yeah
fair enough
that is true
fair enough
ryan does
little john
have a
have a thought
i don't know
my arrows
work in pirates
his arrows
work in pirates
cultists
and
pearl bones
pirates cultists
and pearl bones
like
why
why
i'm still
trying to figure
out the whole
silence thing
that kind of
freaked me out
a little bit
you can tell
it's just some
spell you cast
out of your
eyes but
i don't know
what happened
i shot the
guy twice
fling around
and he died
still trying to
recap with you
what what
what actually
caused this
really crazy
silence
and jason i'd
ask you what
you thought but
i'm not sure
if you've really
been around
long enough to
know what to
know what's
going down
um
the pirates
appear to be
hunting you
that that
much you
should know
yeah okay
they're looking
specifically for
you
um
and uh
yeah
what do i
think about
pirates
there's also a
cult to the
south that
appears to be
being led by
by a demon
um that is
trying to
infiltrate
a temple
in the center
that is
surrounded by
those zombie
pearl
creatures
all right
um
um
i think i'm
kind of with
will john on
this one
you can put
your at
if you're
after us
bring it on
i mean
we're here
to do
a job
so
i'm gonna
let some
pirates
okay
i mean
i feel like
i think
we can kind
of handle
our own
okay
so it
sounds like
we've got
four for
pirates
one for
the uh
one for
the temple
or
the cultists
yeah
it's more
as i want
i'm letting
him decide
but they
one of the
pirates
i was
no i
no i'm
we're
we're
like i'm
i'm just
getting everybody's
perspective
you guys can
play it out
any way you
want
my opinion
i think we
should go back
to the demon
i guess
he seems
the more
lethal threat
right now
am i
that's
right
who i'm
sorry
uh
he
he's advocating
for the demon
for taking care
of the demon
because it's
the bigger threat
more immediate
threat
i think
he's the
saying
yeah
more immediate
threat
yeah
so
sorry
i misunderstood
your question
i thought we were
just talking about
the pirates
so what is
what's the
temple
again i'm
sorry
no the
temple is
uh it's
it's a
temple for
uh marine
which is the
goddess of
uh the goddess
of the sea
um it's
currently surrounded
by
the pearl
the pearl
marked which
are basically
those pearl
zombies that
they were
that you guys
were attracting
to or the
pulp was
attracting via that
crystal ball
yeah
um so
the temple
is basically
surrounded by
hundreds of
those things
um the
cult itself
is south
of that
and they're
trying to
make it
into
that they're
trying to
make it
into
where that
um
that temple
okay
um and the
pirates
appear to be
hunting new
specifically
uh but they're
also
jerks
they're also
jerks
um but
they they
they also
like in the
writings that
you saw
and in your
maps like
there there
appears to be
this booty
that they're
looking for
that's a
pearl
of some
kind
and the
cult has
also probably
made a pact
with the demon
and the
cult has
also probably
made a pact
with the demon
very recently
yep
that's also
a pertinent
piece of
information
kind of
detail
so there's
no
lack
of
things to
hit
oh
how would
we hit
the
how would
we go
after the
pirates
we know
their ship
is where
their ship
is
they could
burn
them down
i guess
first
so if
we head
to the
temple
obviously
the pirates
are still
chasing us
regardless
but if
they're also
chasing after
a pearl
could we
almost make
a small
get them
on our
side
to help
them
have them
help us
attack the
temple
there's
an idea
you could
i mean
obviously
we probably
have to
fight them
after
you know
what i mean
like after
we took
the temple
but
that's an
idea
yeah
or at the
very least
can i figure
out why
they're looking
for you
just
hope they
don't kill
you first
yeah
you can
they might
shoot first
and ask
questions
later
there's
only one
way to
find out
though
bloody pirates
i tell
me
right
bloody
pirates
but as far
as the
pirates
go
they're
here
so
whenever
they come
to shore
they're
probably
taking
some
kind
of
boat
from
their
ship
to
shore
so
theoretically
we could
get to
their
ship
that way
yep
can you
make us
walk on
water
or anything
ice
kirk
doesn't
know
how
magic
works
apparently
that's a
valid
question
that is
a spell
that exists
i like
what's
on the
divine
list
i don't
want to
go swimming
again
i don't
like
for
dock
worker
i don't
like
the
water
very
much
they
might
not
be
a
lot
of
pts
yep
yep
yep
all right
so i think
we gotta
figure out
where that
small boat
arrives
we attack
it
battle
the small
amount of
pirates
that will be
on it
confiscate it
then we can
go scope
out the
main ship
and
even if
we don't
want to
attack the
main ship
we have
their
small boat
then the
main ship
they can't
they don't
have a way
to get to
shore
anymore
we've at
least eliminated
them from
coming aboard
wait wait wait
i i heard a
pirate use
this word
once
parlay
yeah i think
that means
something i think
that means
they'll talk
to us
yep
uh but
somebody else
can do that
though
as
who's got
great
here
i don't
believe
anyone
oh no
arthur does
great
great that
makes sense
yeah i
suppose as
long as the
pirates are
looking for
something here
they're likely
to stay
we got
like the idea
of using
them i mean
they're gonna
use us too
but that's
fine
um i
just that
ship cannot
leave
cannot
leave
uh
that that
is demon
bad that
ship is the
biggest threat
in xander's
mind
why
um because
any of those
pirates could
be infected
but they're
not
that we
know of
hi
and it
just takes
one to get
off
to get
away
and whatever
this is could
spread to the
rest of the
city or to
the mainland
yeah but we're
gonna leave
eventually
if we find a
cure
i'm pretty sure
i'm pretty sure
this no
i'm not infected
i'm gonna leave
anyway
i'm pretty sure
it has something
to do with the
pearl
maybe
because
in my opinion
it could find a
book for
himself
so i think
they i think
somebody stole
a cursed object
and brought it
to brought it
to this
brought it to
them to this
ward and
well i wouldn't
make those
sorts of
logical
leans
you know i'm
not stealing
the entire
i'm not stealing
the entire
caribbean i'm
stealing
visages
yeah
i wouldn't
necessarily
think that
oh somebody's
got a cursed
object and
that's why
things are
bad but
it also
but there's
also no proof
that it's a
disease either
don't know what
there's no proof
that we're not
cursed
that's true
that is possible
you could be
cursed
so there's a
good chance
that ship
hasn't gone
power on it
i have a
love it
you do
have a
deep
he's very
interested
demons probably
died of gunpowder
right
i'm going to
i'm going to
sit on
myself
first
okay
so
are you
going to
be
attempting
to remove
a disease
or a curse
when you
do that
a curse
you're going
to choose
to do
a curse
all right
so you
you spend
you spend
your five
five hit points
touch self
yeah
and
and
and
your
and
the
the
itchy
sensation
that you
have
dissipates
okay
that
answer
that
question
okay
apparently
it's
it's
it's
definitely
a curse
okay
how do we
know it's
a curse
because i
just
dispelled
it
oh
well i guess
we can
leave now
that's
very good
news
problem
solved
done
and
i don't
think you
can cure
everyone
here though
we just
get more
of him
true
they gotta
have
someone to
say to
you right
yeah
i'm a
i'm a
and i'm
low rank
too
so i'm
not that
i'm
not the
i'm
not the
strongest
paladin
can you
show us
how to
do that
i don't
believe i
can't
you
you can
play it out
give him
paladin
levels
train
him to
have
paladin
barbarian
paladin
be the
worst i
couldn't
cast spells
because you
can't
could i still
use spell
slots to
smite though
you're not
casting spells
this isn't
the worst
idea i've
ever heard
this isn't
the worst
idea i've
ever heard
yeah
a barbarian
paladin is
actually not
a bad
thing
see barbarian
rogue that
was pretty
funny
yeah
i thought a
barbarian
druid would
be fun too
yeah
but um
but when it
comes to
multi-classing
in in general
like it's
gonna need
to be
um like
i said it's
just gonna
need to be
sure sure
absolutely
absolutely
yeah
you know
that was
not what i
was angling
towards at
all
i'm just
making
yes
i'd like to
take a level
of rogue
and a
level of
paladin
i'll throw
a level
of warlock
in there
for fun
might as
well
right
yeah
but no
it would
need to
be something
that makes
sense
in story
wise
but i do
apply the
3.5
lobes to
nothing
classes
okay
we are
approaching
that
i wouldn't
know how
to start
that
i'm not
i've never
been a
great teacher
well
sorry
i've never
been a good
learner so
it's great
so yeah
i mean really
at this point
like i think
we've got about
20 minutes
till we hit
10 so i
guess um
really i
would say
um if we
can spend
this time
just kind of
figuring out
where we
want to go
down
so i can
make sure
that we're
prepped and
ready to go
next
that would
probably be
the best
use of our
time
um
my
you want to
do that
role
play
whatever
yeah
my personal
feeling is
still
that for
multiple reasons
the pirates
are kind of
the
they are both
the
potentially the
most pressing
thing
but also
the most
hey
the thing
that gives
us the
most options
because they
are at least
theoretically
people that
can be spoken
to and
reasoned with
or manipulated
or
that's fair
okay
everything else
we must keep
holding the
option
you don't
know
yeah
okay
i want to
try this
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
that's my
feeling
plus i don't
like that
i don't like
one of us
being hunted
and i would
prefer that
be off our
backs before
we try to
deal with
the bigger
problems
yeah
fuck your
corners
you know
their deformity
their deformity
kind of
yeah
that makes sense
to me
but it doesn't
completely disappear
it shrinks
okay
yeah
so
but they
but you know
they're grateful
when you
when you do
that
but if you're
if you're
going to
like
you're not
going to get
any more
lay on hands
points
yeah
until you
long rest
again
no no
i was asking
i was asking
i was asking
you spent
10 of
your 15
of course
so be
careful
yeah
yeah
yeah
i just
i just
wanted to
i just
wanted to
see
if i
could
do it
entirely
or
if it's
this
well
is the
impression
that you
get
when you
when you
cure
when you
remove the
curse
is the
curse
itself
is
removed
but the
deformities
themselves
aren't
removed
ah
so it's
like
once you
get to
a certain
stage
it's just
this is
just part
of
part of
who you
are
not a
tumor
yeah
so
so
it makes
it lesser
and you
know
they're
definitely
not
you know
in as
bad of a
shape
like you
know
somebody
who's got
a club
foot
all of a
sudden
they can
they can
use
their
foot
and that
kind of
thing
but
okay
the deformities
themselves
are still
still
okay
shut up
it will
get to a
certain point
and it's
the
noble turn
right
nope
I'll put
you a noble turn
okay
okay
that was a
simple test
I'm not
going to do
that
I'm not
going to do
another
later on
the
so
pirates
huh
is that
what I'm
hearing
I think
so
do you
guys have
an idea
about like
what the
group's
approach to
the pirates
is going
to be
yeah
find where
they're landing
their
smaller boat
on the shore
I'm pretty sure
I'm pretty sure
you remember
when they said
there was a
small
four miles
of
coast
yeah
yeah
pretty sure
the pirates
are coming
from there
four miles
is still
a lot
yeah
yeah
yeah
so
figure out
where they're
coming from
and then
we've got
the whole idea
do we want to
try to negotiate
a
movement
question mark
question mark
yeah
no
yeah
if we can
well
group them
and they're
cruising
and I'm
sorry I'm
going to
say this
we do
have something
they want
that will
at least
probably bring
them to the
table
that's true
I think
I'm not
saying we
have to
give you
to them
I'm just
saying
that will
get their
attention
so
head off
I mean
we could
not
roll
you're not
you're not
rolling
we controlled
the four miles
to find where
the small boat
is landing
and we could
choose
the number
of people
the number
of pirates
on a small
boat
to either
attack them
negotiate
or in some
manner
use them
as bait
if they
are
wanting
to
if they
themselves
want
something
from the
temple
then great
if not
we just
take out
the small
crew
and then
destroy
their small
vessel
so they can't
transport themselves
and then we
take over
a pirate ship
and the high seas
are ours
naval campaign
let's go
it's a pirate
campaign now
we are the
pirates
now
I like it
they're trying
to get to the
temple too
we can use
that
the person
I actually
did that too
I was doing
I was working
as a captain
that's what
yeah
same thing
same thing
same thing
or we like
the cult
is sort of
a way
into the
temple
I don't
identify
where the
curse is
coming from
doesn't
it's not
a disease
so
Arthur
have a
if I'm
standing
so close
to him
doesn't he
have a thing
that like
can help
protect me
yeah
he's got
a guard
a guard
bonus action
so if I
am offered
up as
bait
if I'm
standing
next to
him
it would
offer me
a little
bit more
protection
yeah
well he
has to be
actively
shielding
you
oh
oh
oh
okay
so
you know
maybe
his guy's
arm draped
around
that's
right
he'll
hang in
he's
protecting
casually
like I'm
walking
him home
right at
the bar
that's
right
you're in
stumble mode
it's fine
drunken
master
that's right
that's right
that's right
I love it
so the
you told us
where the
boat was
you know
what direction
we're walking
right
yeah so
the boat
like I
mean the
the coast
is on the
is on the
other side
of the
time watch
board so
you're looking
at um
probably close
to a 10
mile
10 to
12 mile
walk
let me
it's a big
district
it is
holy shit
the city's
massive
yeah it's
10 miles
Jimmy
Christmas
it's like
basically the
the tide
watch ward
is effectively
half of
new
pin there's
um
the
10 miles
is still
massive
for a city
that's big
yeah it is
the largest
ward in
in there
um
and yeah
it is
gigantic
yeah
um
before we
leave
I'm gonna
ask
Thorn
did I
remember
that right
very
Thorn
Captain
Thorn
uh
kind of
tell him
what our
where we're
going
and ask
him if
he had
if
there are
any
cells or
shelters
in that
area
where they
would be
yeah so
he
lets you
know that
there is
uh
there are
two
along the
way
one that
is um
it's pretty
close to
where
where
your uh
where
where the
uh
salty dog
was
so it's
or a
saucy dog
salty dog
salty dog
um
no are you
touching
it's
salty
hey baby
um
but no
you got
uh
so it's
really close
to where
the
spicy dog
which is a
korean restaurant
there's
what that's
about
sorry I'm a
terrible
person
I should
not say
words out
loud
and then
there's
another
one that
is
about
two
miles
west
of
coastline
you do
have
so you do
have some
options to be
able to get
over there
that's a good
also if you do
wish to spend
before you guys
leave
and you don't
have to
like
figure it out
you can figure
it out like
over the course
of um
between now
and next time
um
there are
um
there are
apothecary
there's an
apothecary
there
so if you
want to pick
up any
potions
or anything
anything like
that you
can
um
there isn't
a lot of
like magic
weaponry
and magic
items there
but anything
that like
if you can
find like
a common
magic item
um
i'm willing
to hear
a request
for it
and if it
makes sense
that they
would have
something like
that
yeah
then uh
you can
you can
purchase those
okay
let me check
bag of holding
uh bag of
holding
um
maybe
um
that would
that would
definitely be
something that
i would
actually need
to look
and see
if it is
on my
magic item
or not
but yeah
i can
i can
look
and let
you know
um
i think
that i
think
that
what's that
yeah i was gonna
say we don't have
like a ton of
money yeah
i mean it's more
money than i've
ever had in my
life
right
it's still
it's still not
but each one of
these magic
items is three
times that
amount
yeah
so yeah
most magic
items you're
looking at
probably spending
around a thousand
gold for one
um just to do
like a plus one
weapon
the magic items
that you guys
have
um are
minimum
two thousand
gold
item that you
got your
armor that you
got which is not
a map item is
still two
thousand gold
yeah
just regular
plate armor is
bonkers expensive
so that's
that's where
some of your
that's where
some of your
money
went
yeah
so
um
do these pirates
know we're a group
or they just know
they're looking for me
they know that
you're traveling
with people
but they
don't but
i mean basically
what what you
guys overheard
was
uh
they said
you know
they said
well we're
looking for
the monk
he went
this way
we don't care
about the rest
of them
just make sure
that you
find him
i wouldn't
worry about it
it's fine
it's fine
i was just
thinking
trying to get
close to him
yeah
it's like
it could be
oh hey
we heard you
were looking
for a monk
we found him
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
you could try
you could try
and try and pull
that off
do the old
fake wookie
prisoner
yeah
yep
about the only
thing that i can
see kind of
causing a little
snafu in that
is that the only
person who has
the ability to
lie
is your paladin
and i can't
believe in why
he's there
but other than
that
hey
hey
hey
i have a
i have a zero
charisma mod
i can lie
just fine
right
you can lie
yes
i have
i can lie
adequate
you can lie
adequately
hmm
um
unless
unless jezerick
actually has
a good charisma
from which
he starts playing
him so
i actually don't
think he does
man
what the
i think he
dumped charisma
too
we're all like
meh
everybody
who needs
people skills
likely
unlikable
people
well none of
us are human
that's true
we're just a
motley
ragtag
group of
ne'er-do-wells
and a paladin
and a paladin
who somehow
is hanging out
with us
we're
we're like
one step away
from being
pirates ourselves
okay that's
and it's not a
very
it's not a
very big
step
okay
just look at
little john's
picture
yeah
that's a
pirate
it does
it does
yeah a little
bit
and i mean
i have a
criminal
back
i already
have an
anchor
playing
little john
from
robin hood
there's a
stone
volcanoes
yep
all right
cool well
um i think
that if that's
if that's kind
of the direction
that we want
to go
uh you guys
are going to
be heading
towards the
coast to
see if you
can figure out
um that's uh
that's what
we'll get
doing
that's what
we'll get
doing
that's that's
the direction
that we will
it's okay
i feel better
that i'm not
