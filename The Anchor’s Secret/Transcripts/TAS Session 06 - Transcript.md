All kinds of joy yes
I'm ready
I'm ready
All the angels of eternity
Oh
Oh
Alright
Who remembers
What happened
I remember we made a deal with the pirates
And we
And we
And he told us the history of what the
After
The
The goddess Pearl
I think he remembered
That I don't know if you shared
That information or not
I
Probably I would have
There's no reason why I would keep that
Myself
And then we decided to
Make it look like our camp has been
Attacked by monsters and we fled
That's right
And basically we ran
And we ran into
Some fog monsters
You did the fog
You stared into the fog
Too much
Or too deeply
And the fog stared back
Or something like that
Yeah
No that is a very good synopsis
That's about it
We're trying to beat them to the temple
Was the idea
You got the whole map
You got the whole map
You got everything squared away
Down
The part that you remembered
From getting there
And you hightailed it
To
Towards the temple
You
Haven't gotten to
The
The perimeter yet
But you are trying to beat
The pirates
To the temple
In order to be able to
Um
Do something
With the pearl
Prior to the pirates
Just absconding with it
You're right
Um
Any other motivations
That anybody can think of
About what
What was going on
For you
Or your team
I remember
We think the pearl
Was involved somehow
With the curse
With the curse
With the curse
Right
But we're not
Real sure
How or what or why
Right
Maybe it was moved
And that caused it
Or something
We thought maybe
I'm trying to remember
But yeah
You're not really sure
What happened
You know that the
So you do know
That the pirates
Um
Sent a
Sent crew members
To go and
Steal the pearl
Yep
Um
About six months ago
Yeah
A little bit before
The um
The Tidewatch war
Yeah
Grew up
Yeah
Um
There
If memory serves
There was a
Um
There was
A thought around
That being
That you are
That you suspect
That the pirates
Are the ones
That actually
Cause this to happen
Yeah
Whether intentionally
Or unintentionally
Yep
Um
The pearl itself
From your
From your remembrance
Yeah
Remembering
Um
Having an affinity
With the pearl
Uh huh
Um
You remember that the pearl
Is a
Um
Basically a
Weather controlling
Right
Sphere
Over
The um
Over
Penmaris
Yep
Um
And
You
And
Based off
Of kind of what happened
With the flaming retribution
You weren't necessarily here
When that happened
Yep
But based off of everything else
That you saw
Um
And how
Everything kind of
Panned out
You feel like the pearl
You suspect
Not feel
You suspect
That the pearl
Might have something to do
With this island
Still existing
Right
Yes
And if it was removed
By the pirates
The island may cease
To exist
Correct
That is your
That is your speculation
Yes
It would become an Atlantis
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Right
Right
Or at least cease to exist
Above the waves
Yeah
Right
Um
Almost as if the pearl
Is anchoring
The
Yeah
To the sea
Yep
Sick
Yeah
That
Um
Anything else
Before we
Jump into it
Um
I need
A luck
You need
A luck
Who else
Need some luck
Anybody else feeling lucky
Luck for you
Luck for you
Luck for you
I don't know
But
I might need a luck
But
Last time I remember
I got down a few times
You have
A luck
And your
Sheet says
A luck
Um
I
If
I
If
I'm holding on to your character sheet
I try and just keep
Whatever luck points you had
With your character sheet
So
Okay
Um
Ideally
You won't be
In need of any luck
But
Okay
Like
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
That was last time
So
Alright
So
So
So
Basically
Okay
So
So
Basically
Okay
So
Where we are
Last time we were
I believe we still in the courtyard
But
Right
Right
Right
Right
Right
Right
Right
Right
No I
That wasn't a
I don't remember the cause
That was a
I'm distracted by all the buttons
That was a
I don't remember the cause
That was a
I'm distracted by all the buttons
That I have
So
I
I know where we are
Um
Music
Gilroy's house
Yes
We are 100% at Gilroy's house
Is that where I am?
I think so
I think so
Um
Uh
Up
where are you?
How is doing your thing?
Please, I have dramatic background stuff.
Oh, drama.
All right, now that I have my mood music.
Uh-huh.
Maybe a little bit quieter.
Okay.
It's just a little too intense.
The fog around you just dissipates as you've defeated the creatures that were causing this fog to happen.
Um, you look further, you look further towards where you're going, you look behind, you see that...
Um, well, actually, let's do some perceptuals.
Yeah.
I'm not going to just tell you what you see.
Bam!
Oh, my bad.
My bad.
My bad.
Do those 20.
Yep.
Perception.
There we go.
There we go.
One or two.
One or two.
One or two.
Eighteen and thirteen.
So that's just to combine?
Uh, you, you take the, uh, you take the highest of...
Oh, for your perception, you just roll one.
Um, he has a special value that's not a perception.
That's right.
That's right.
He's got his baddest stuff.
Yeah.
He's special.
Ten.
Okay, so you get your ten, and then you find your perception skill, um, which I think is like an eye or something.
Um...
I think it's an ear.
It's an ear.
And then you add, and then you add the two to that, so...
Twelve.
Twelve.
Okay.
Five.
Ten.
Fourteen.
Fourteen.
And twenty-two.
My brain.
My brain wasn't...
Um, Mr. Twenty-two.
Um, you definitely are able to find that while you do have a head start on the pirates.
Yep.
You don't have as much of a head start that you thought you did.
Don't like that.
Um, so they appear to be, they don't appear to be following you, um, but they appear to be moving into a specific direction that is pretty similar to your direction.
Mmm.
Um, but they are like an hour or two off.
Mmm.
So it's kinda, it's not like you look down the street, it's like you, you go back, you go up.
Yeah.
Get a good vantage point, you're kinda scoping out where everything is.
Okay.
And you see them like, in the distance.
Um, or at least a group that looks like they could be pirates.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Alright.
It's just a kind of weird because we, we basically, we basically have a kind of weird.
Because, if you think about it, it's not weird.
That's why they have the same dastardly plan we did.
Maybe they thought the exact same thing that you did.
Exactly.
Maybe they weren't waiting until morning either.
Alright.
Alright.
Okay.
Pirates are not honorable.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Pirate.
What?
Um, but yeah, but you do still have a couple hours on them.
Yeah.
You know, so you're, you, you are definitely in the lead.
But you might want to move a little bit further.
Yeah.
For the rest of you guys, you definitely are able to see the, the lay of the land.
Um, there is, you, you have a clear line to the temple, but you do also see the thronging
masses of these, um, of these coral, these pearl, these, um, pearl bound creatures, um, that,
um, that seem to be congregating in the general, in like in a mile, a couple mile radius around
the temple.
Okay.
The temple itself.
Yeah.
So proceed with caution.
Yeah.
All right.
So, yep.
With that new information.
What are you guys going to do?
We're just moving.
Moving.
I think everyone's healthy, right?
Everyone's good on that point.
I'm at half.
I'm barely, I'm barely a quarter.
Oh, your max hit points should have, or your current hit points should have gone up with
your max hit points.
Oh.
I'm at half.
I'm at half.
I'm barely, I'm barely a quarter.
Oh.
Your max hit points should have, or your current hit points should have gone up with your max hit
points.
Oh.
Good.
So, basically I will fetch?
Not, not completely, but, like, it, whatever it is that you rolled, like, I think you had
like eight hit points that you got, right?
Was it eight?
Was it six?
I, I, I, I, I, I.
Was it six plus two?
My current hit points.
My current hit points.
No, I'm not talking about your current hit points.
I'm talking about what you rolled.
Oh, yes.
I have to do that.
For your, for your level up.
Yeah.
I have 50.
No.
When I told you to roll a die and then add your constitution modifier to it earlier today.
Yeah.
Do you remember what number you rolled?
Eight.
Eight.
Oh, add eight to that.
That go, yeah, add eight to that.
Mm-hmm.
Exactly.
Yeah.
Yep.
Okay.
So you're still hurting, but.
Okay.
I'm at house health.
I'm basically a little less than half health.
Okay.
Yeah.
I'm a little less than half health.
All right.
How long is the short rest again, Chris?
Short rest is 10 minutes.
Okay.
It's basically just, it is literally just taking a break down.
Yeah.
I'm using Pathfinder short rest stuff.
So yeah.
If you do, if you do want to heal up guys, you can take a short rest and use your hit
dice.
Yep.
We got time for that.
Yeah.
I'm full.
I'm good.
But.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We should take 10 minutes for the battle.
Yeah.
So.
Yep.
What that means, Ian, is when you, when you, um, spend a hit die, you take your D10 and roll
that, you roll that.
Okay.
And then you add your constitution modifier to it.
Okay.
Um, and that is, and you heal that much.
But you can only do it up to the number of times that you've got your, your hit dice.
You're going to die there.
You've got four D10.
Four D10.
So you can only do it four times.
Okay.
Um, until you long rest or until you, it doesn't seem like we're getting another one of those
for a while.
Probably not.
No.
Not at this moment.
I'm just going to do what right now?
Well, I, yes.
Do that.
No, I'm not saying don't do it.
Okay.
10.
Plus.
Sick.
Uh, 24.
Oh, that's 10 plus your constitution modifier.
Oh, 12.
12.
Add that to your current.
And that's, uh, that's, uh, oh, 30 heat steers.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that's, uh, that's, uh, oh, 33, 36.
36.
36 out of 50.
You want to do it one more time?
Uh, no.
Why not?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Do it one more.
Okay.
It is, it is better to use hit buys than small slots.
Correct.
This is, this is a, this is a resource that you should, that you should use as much as possible.
Yup.
It doesn't really cost anything except for 10 minutes.
And we don't want you to be in a place where.
Okay.
So how does he know what?
Okay.
So got your hit points.
You're at, uh, 47.
So I got 10 delta.
Yup.
So at that point, if you want to roll more, if you want to do that, then you just use one
of your hit dice and roll a d10 and that should get you close enough to keep the max.
Okay.
Okay.
Another 10?
Yeah.
Alright.
I think you're done.
Yes.
With your, uh, with your 40 out of, 48 out of 50.
It would be a waste.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Spend another hit die.
Yeah.
Is that 10 sided die?
Is that?
Yeah.
The 10 sided die is that one.
Yeah.
That's one.
That's pretty good.
Yeah.
48.
Yeah.
Well.
Isn't that just the way?
Yup.
Yup.
There.
He rolls two 10s.
You roll a one.
Uh huh.
But that'll, uh, well it's one plus your constitution modifier so you'll also have that plus three.
So it's four.
Okay.
Instead of one.
Um.
Alright.
Cool.
But yeah, Ian, especially when it's out, like this is out of combat healing.
So you're out of combat, you should use your out of combat healing.
Okay.
If you are in combat, you won't be able to do this.
Right.
So that's why, it's, that's why I kind of pushed back by you being like, I'm not going
to spend it.
I'm like, you're in the middle of combat, you're not going to be able to do this.
It's more, it's, it's more valuable you do it right now.
Alright.
So, okay.
Everybody's healed.
Yeah.
Took you about 10 minutes just to rest up.
Yep.
Re-center yourself and you're diving into the, uh, into the tide watch ward.
Yep.
I get it.
Yep.
Ready.
Alright.
And then, uh, Jason, you've also got back your technique points on a short rest.
Oh, yep.
So you didn't spend any of those.
Those are back too.
Yeah.
So you're back up to five.
Don't be short rested.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Alright.
So you guys.
Probably could just burn those every flight.
Yeah.
Be fine.
Yes.
That's a good one for me.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
I'm pretty sure that the, in the, in D&D, thinking that this is based off of like, you
have, you know, your refreshes on a long rest or something.
So, which makes Monk really.
Yeah.
I think it upgrades your short rest at some point, but.
Yeah.
Doesn't start off that way for me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Anyway.
Okay.
So you guys are going in, um, you're diving into the, into the tide watch ward.
Yeah.
We're following.
Um, you're following, you're, you're, you're heading into the area where, um, where the zombie
ring is.
Mm-hmm.
Um, so it's, as you go, you, again, you see weird and odd creatures that don't necessarily,
um, that don't necessarily make sense to you.
Um, you've seen some of these things, these, these morphed frog creatures, but you also see
things like alligators that are, um, that have crease, that have crystalline skin and you
can, you know, are transparent.
You can see their entrails in their extra.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And no pain.
Um.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And you do also, you do also see the fog kind of shifting in that unnatural way.
But having seen what, what actually hides in that fog, you know enough to steer clear of
those areas.
Um, whereas before it was just kind of like speculation.
Um, you, uh, let's go ahead and roll some dice here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm looking for a, um, I'm gonna go ahead and throw in a clock.
Mmm.
Beat.
Beat the pirates.
Yep, yep, yep, yep.
Um, we're gonna have a four pie clock.
Uh-huh.
Um, you will see on the thing, uh, probably right over here, there's a little beat the pirates.
Ooh.
Yeah.
Nope.
There's a doom.
Oh.
There is a doom, which is important to know.
The doom we have deemed.
It's not showing off.
Why are you being lame?
Do-do-do-do.
It's not hiding.
It's calling someone to throw an error message.
At some point it's time to see you and then it disappears.
Error 404.
Error 404.
Error 404 for one second.
Just enough to say.
Do-do-do-do.
You thought that was my favorite load, you silly goose.
This is what I get for, um.
Error 404.
Error 404.
Page not found.
Page not found.
This is what I get for relying on technology.
I work in technology.
I should know better.
Error 404.
I should know better.
Oh.
Oh.
.
Error 404.
Page not found.
This is what I get for relying on technology.
I work in technology.
I should know better.
Error 404.
Oh, yeah.
There, it's acup of trash.
There?
Error 404.
Page not found.
That's what I get for relying on technology.
I work in technology.
I should know better.
.
Oh, she's doing all right, she went to the ER yesterday, it's that diverticulitis, which
is a, you know back in the day when we just needed a piece of grass paper, back, so she had
that two years ago.
We probably still only just need a piece of grass paper, all right, so you will see up
here there is a doom counter, which I will explain later, you don't have to worry about
that right now, and there is a beat the pirates, that has, it's what's referred to as a clock,
so it's basically a four point, a four point clock that we, that I will add pie pieces to
it, or remove pie pieces from it, depending on, depending on your rolls as you're trying
to navigate the pad watch board.
So, um, the idea is you want to get four successes before you get four failures, um, in order
to be able to have beaten the pirates to the, um, to the temple.
Also, should be noted that sometimes decisions that you make may give you an automatic success
or an automatic failure, depending on how you handle situations.
So, that is, uh, your own business.
Yes.
So, you guys are running through, I need somebody to make a, um, to make a athletics or survival
role to start us off.
I would take the, I would take the athletics one.
Go for it.
Yeah, I have, I have a plus seven in that, so, yeah, I'll give you that athletics.
Okay.
Once you have used athletics, you will not be able to use that again until, uh, until,
until that, that refreshes.
So, we're not going to be able to just kind of power through the athletics to get, uh,
to get in there.
So, this is your one roll.
Yep.
Get you in.
Okay.
And we're looking for it.
True.
Okay.
He's, um, we were looking for a 15 to succeed.
Yeah, yeah.
Um.
I have it.
But, he rolled a 20.
Sick.
Which is going to give you two.
Yeah.
Natural successes.
So, Ian's dice are hot tonight.
Yeah, they are.
My gosh.
All right.
Come on, baby.
Come on.
I tell you.
All right.
So, you guys basically just book it, you know, and, um, Arthur basically leads the
way, encouraging the rest of you to follow in, in suit as he gets further, further, further,
um, up and further into the ward, um, you guys are at, um, you guys are not quite to the,
um, you're, you're not quite to the, uh, pearl bound parameter, uh, perimeter.
Um, but you have gained significantly on the, um, on the pirates.
You go back and you check and you're like, oh, wow, they, they're moving at half speed.
What's going on with that?
So, you have a really good headway on that.
Yeah.
Now, as you, as you approach the, the area where, and again, the, the perimeter is kind
of, it's kind of, it's kind of wishy washy.
These creatures have a tendency to dense and up the closer you get there, but as you look
out and you kind of are surveying everything, you're looking back at pirates, you're looking
around, you do see to the south, um, you see thunder and lightning.
Well, you don't see thunder, but you see a lightning flashing in the air and you see
something kind of flying around in that air.
Um, go ahead and roll a roll of perception.
Anybody who cares to.
Sure.
I like to perceive.
I have advantage.
Uh, 21.
That's it.
Okay.
Um, so, danger.
Yep.
You're, you see, you see, you hear, you sense evil.
Oh.
Um, in that general direction.
Okay.
You hear the sounds of, you hear the sounds of battle.
And you, um, as you're looking up at the, like the kind of thing that's kind of floating
in the sky with the lightning, the lightning is kind of flashing from that, that thing.
Yeah.
And you definitely see that this is a, this is not a creature of this world.
Um, you see, this creature that is, um, for lack of a better term, looks like the devil.
Yeah.
Um, horns, has a pitchfork, tail, everything that you would expect.
Um, the, the flames, flames and lightning appear to be looking around the thing.
Um, and it seems to be focused down in, in that area.
It appears to be attacking something.
And again, you hear the sounds of battle as well.
Um, it's not like so far away that you wouldn't be able to get there if you wanted to.
It's not like two or three hours away.
Yeah.
It's like half hour, 15 minutes.
Sure.
It's something where if you wanted to intervene, you would have the opportunity to do so.
Okay.
Um, but this creature is definitely attacking something.
Um, and it's kind of like, it's kind of weird cause it's flying around and it could be anywhere
if it wants to, why is it, why is it focused on this one?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
How like far out of our way is it?
About half hour.
Okay.
All right.
So it's not anywhere.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
On the path.
It's yeah, it is out of your way for sure.
Yeah.
But you have been gaining on the pirates.
Yeah.
Maybe it's worth it.
Maybe it's not.
I don't know.
Yup.
Yup.
Uh, I'll explain.
Um, and ask what do you, what do you, what do you guys think?
I don't like that thing.
Anything it's doing.
Uh, I'm pretty sure that's a demon that was here to hunt.
Oh.
Yup.
Uh, Skirk and Arthur both made, both were hired to find and exterminate a demon.
And this is common knowledge important.
Yup.
Yup.
Yup.
Yup.
So, I'm pretty sure that's a demon that was here to hunt.
Skirk might already be running out of him.
Yeah.
Oh shit.
Skirk's already gone.
He got him.
He got him.
Uh.
Uh.
Uh.
Uh.
Uh.
Uh.
My opinion, I, I believe the pearl is a big, a bigger matter right now.
I agree.
But.
Uh, I think the game is honest.
You said.
Uh, it's kind of off.
To the side.
It's off there.
It's off to the side.
It is moving north in the same general direction that you're moving.
Okay.
So, that, that, that is happening.
Yeah.
It's not like staying stationary to where it is.
But it's moving a lot slower.
Yeah.
It appears to be kind of supporting something that's happening on the ground.
Uh.
Um.
And I believe, I believe I might be fighting monsters over there.
So, I don't, I do not want to tingle with that right now.
Either.
Uh.
We don't know what we're getting into.
Uh.
If we had a scout or anything.
We might be able to do it.
But I, I.
I.
I.
I do not want to tingle with something that we might be.
Do.
Like it.
We might, we might have two enemies over there.
We.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's possible.
You do also have allies in there.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Is that the general direction of the, one of my.
Well.
They're all over.
They're, yeah.
They're kind of all around.
They're, and their job specifically, their self-proclaimed duty is to protect the ward from
evil.
Oh.
And you laugh about that.
And you do know that.
So.
Hmm.
Do I have anything?
I do not.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That was my only thought too, was if it's attacking something good, which seems likely,
um, it may be able to help us if we get rid of that demon thing attacking it.
Um, also, I'm trying to think if there's any way, I don't think we can redirect it currently,
but.
Maybe we can fight him.
Huh?
If there was a way to get that thing to fight the pirates, well, that'd be, that'd be sick.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
I just don't have anything to do with that.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha.
Wait.
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.
Well, maybe I do.
Maybe you can leave one of your lights and shoot it at the pirates, make it bright enough
so the demon sees it and follows it.
Yeah, we'd have to get close enough to the pirates.
Yeah.
Maybe, but I think it's really distracted.
It seems very intent on what it's doing right now.
Also, something that you would know from your paladin studies, demons are not stupid.
Okay.
They are, they don't run on instinct.
Okay.
They are very clever and they always do whatever it is that they're doing with a purpose.
Okay.
Yes.
So, this guy is most assuredly doing something that will, that, that will further his own
ends right now.
He's not just running around blowing crap up because he can.
He's being, you guys have suspected that the storm, the storm, the storm collar cult is worshiping
him.
Do you think that if he had hundreds of worshipers, he'd just be running around blowing shit
up?
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
So, just some additional information about that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That, I'm pretty sure your character is like, I got a bow, I got a little arrow for this
guy, you got a shield.
The other concern is, if we leave him alone, we could just have another enemy come up behind
us, which I'm not a huge fan of.
Yeah.
And he is moving north.
Right.
And you guys, and he's to the south, and you guys are heading.
Yeah.
That'd be a pretty bad combo to have.
You can't see demon pirates.
You can't see demon pirates.
Right.
If all three of us were to be in the same.
The demon pirates.
Right.
We could do the spider man thing and then have to fight everybody.
Yeah.
I mean, let's maybe...
That would be epic.
We might all die.
That detour at least enough to see what's going on.
Okay.
Maybe if we can get close enough to get a better view.
Like, we've got some time.
We've made some time.
Right now.
Yeah.
And then we can decide if we want to engage or not.
But I think I would at least like to know a little more.
Yeah.
Okay.
We do have long range.
Right?
You can shoot.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And if we get close enough, I don't know if you can, but maybe you can sneak and get a
better look too.
I don't know how sneaky you are, but one of the two of you might be able to do that.
I can't.
All right.
I'm going to scurry.
Yeah.
So your stealth skill, if you flip it over back to your skill section.
I don't.
My next tiered first stealth is at 18.
Yeah.
So you got plus six to yourself, which is good.
Yeah.
That's pretty decent.
That's pretty good.
Pretty decent.
And I would be very surprised if the monk wasn't at least.
I don't plus six as well.
Yeah.
Incomparable.
Yeah.
All right.
All right.
So you do that.
You guys do have some scouts.
Yep.
You just didn't realize it.
Yep.
What's up?
Hey.
All right.
I'm a plus four scouts.
But you are also running around in mail, which means you have a disadvantage.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's my problem too.
Yeah.
Okay.
So you guys are, so what I'm hearing is you're thinking you're going to, you're going to
run up and, or not run up.
Are you going to go and check out, see what's, what's happening over there?
Yep.
A little bit, you know, try and keep yourself, um, cautious, uh, or cautious, but keep yourself,
um, hidden so that they don't necessarily spot you and then run in there.
Yeah.
All right.
Sounds like a DC 15 stealth check for anybody who's getting, who's wanting to do the scouting.
Yeah.
All right.
Oh, once we get close enough, that becomes an issue where I'm going to hang back because
I'm no good at the actual scouting.
Yeah.
But I think we can travel some distance together before.
Yeah, for sure.
Yeah.
And you know, it's also kind of one of those things where like, I would say that you'd be
like, they can kind of scout ahead and basically like encourage you guys forward so that you're
not like, yeah, and it's a excruciating distance part.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So Ryan and Jason, uh, you guys are the stealth dudes.
So, um, if you want to go ahead and roll some D twenties and add six to that, hope for a 15 or
two, eight plus six, eight plus six.
That's real close.
Getting lucky.
I didn't have any luck.
Oh, all right.
Well, you have some now.
Yep.
Congratulations.
But we got something to go here.
You got something good.
Um, so you are, you are, um, able to keep things pretty quiet.
Um, you guys get into, uh, get close enough to kind of see the action.
And what you see is that, um, that monster is actually doing a couple of things.
Um, so there are, um, well, let me, let me take a step back here.
Hold on a little bit.
As you guys go through this, through the, the, the tidewatch ward, um, or, you know, you
kind of are trying to cut over to get ahold of those guys.
Um, you have entered into pearl bound territory.
Um, you see the, you see the pearl bound, um, you've been avoiding them as best you can.
Um, but they don't necessarily appear to be as interested in you as you had anticipated.
Um, so it's not like you don't, you, you don't like go and stare at one in the face.
And it just, you walk away.
Right.
So it's not that drastic, but like, it's like you, there are a couple of times where you're
like, I could have sworn that that thing, like I was, I was too close, but it didn't
appear to, didn't appear to go, go at me.
Yeah.
Um, specifically.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So that's, that's what you, that's what you pick up.
Uh, this demon is basically entering into the pearl bound territory as well.
He is, um, basically calling down, um, calling down magics to, um, kind of cut waves in the
pearl bound that are very much surging towards him and his, um, his acolytes.
His acolytes are as well are, um, engaged in battle with the, um, with the coral marks,
um, iron tide regimen.
There aren't many of them there, but they're trying to hold the line while this cult is trying
to move in at the center of the group of the Colts.
There is a, a covered wagon that's being pulled by, um, by some just regular horses.
Um, but there, but it's not moving fast and it's kind of like, you know, being handled
with care.
Yeah.
By the, uh, by the acolytes.
Sorry.
Oh.
Okay.
So that's what you see.
Okay.
All right.
So we've got kind of a three-way battle going on.
Right.
Yeah.
So the, uh, it's basically the pearl bound, um, are attacking both the iron tide regimen
and the, and the storm, storm collar cult.
Yeah.
The storm collar cult is attacking both back.
The demon is more focused on the pearl bound than he is on the iron tide regimen.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that's, that's kind of like where we're at.
Okay.
They have something in a cart.
A cart.
And something in a cart.
Probably bad.
Probably.
Hmm.
Okay.
Call it a hunch.
Okay.
Demon protecting a cart.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
We can, might slow them down.
We can, might slow these demons down.
If, if we take something, if we can take that thing in the cart.
And we can, if we can, if we can, if we can sneak in and try to take it.
Okay.
And we'll go ahead and send the clock back by one as you're being distracted by the thing.
Yep.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So the, the problem that you have right now is you're racing pirates.
Yep.
There's this thing happening here.
What are you gonna do?
Yep.
You haven't lost time completely.
Yeah.
You still have gained on them.
You've just, you know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, we're already here.
Yep.
Uh, I'm kind of thinking we do something.
Uh.
Maybe blow up the, blow up the wagon or.
Maybe.
Yeah, but we don't know what's in the wagon.
Right.
I mean, if we blow it up it might be.
Yeah.
Might be bad, bad.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Maybe.
Yeah.
Maybe.
I mean, it's also possible something we could use.
Right.
I mean, if we blow it up it might be.
Yeah, might be bad, bad.
Yeah.
I mean, it's also possible something we could use.
Right.
So, I'm thinking we just help our, our boys out.
I, I don't want-
We could try to steal it, but I don't know, sneaking into an active battlefield is going to work out super well.
It does look like the biggest, if you wanted to help everybody out the most, it does appear like the Iron High Regiment appears to be doing okay against the cultists.
The real wild card in this entire situation is the demon.
Sure.
Okay.
So if you're looking for biggest bang for your buck, the most obvious biggest bang for your buck is also the most dangerous thing.
Yeah.
Yep.
Yep.
Makes sense to me.
Yeah.
But you can totally, you can totally support the Iron High Regiment to jump, jump into battle there.
There's, you know, there's definitely opportunity.
You have many choices.
Yes.
Yes.
You have many choices.
And while you're figuring that out, I'll just go ahead and set up a battle.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Combat appears to be happening in some way, shape, or form.
That will help.
Oh.
Oh.
There you go.
Oh.
Okay.
We're full.
All right.
So the demon is about here.
I don't think we were able to help them out that much, but I think we can maybe slow them down.
That's my opinion.
Slow the cultists down.
Slow the cultists and the demons down.
And...
Cultists there.
That's my opinion.
If you want to help, we slow the cultists and the demons down.
And this is the cart.
Okay.
That...
I don't...
I think I don't...
The Iron Regiment is about here.
And we will have a couple more cultists as well.
So those guys...
The good guys know that we're good guys too, right?
They're gonna...
They...
They do.
Or at least some of them.
Some idea.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You guys are...
And you guys can choose your marching order any way you see fit.
But you guys are over here.
I should be in my...
Okay.
All right.
So we got...
Purple cultists.
Green are more cultists.
Green are more cultists.
These orange-y color are good guys.
Are good guys.
Yes.
Okay.
And...
That guy's over there.
And we will also be like...
Pearl bound.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Pearl bound.
Yep.
So...
Sick.
And there are a couple of pearl bound over here, but these cultists are kind of...
Yeah.
And the pearl bound are fighting the cultists, right?
They're fighting either, buddy.
Yeah.
So the pearl bound are fighting the cultists.
The pearl bound are all...
The Iron Tide Regiment is also engaged with the pearl bound.
Yeah.
They're fighting whoever gets close.
Yeah.
They are exhibiting behavior that you would expect of zombies guarding a specific space.
Uh-huh.
But you haven't actually seen that behavior against yourselves for whatever reason.
Yeah.
Interesting.
And this guy's not doing much.
He's just kind of hanging out.
Well, he's...
Or is he involved in...
He's flying around.
His main efforts are basically...
It appears at this point, he's trying to clear a path for that cart to move forward.
Okay.
So that's...
That appears to be what's happening with him.
Okay.
Hmm.
Yep.
Little John, what's the range on your...
What do you have range?
Yeah, he's got...
It's 120, 150, something...
150.
It's a lot.
He can shoot anywhere on the port.
Okay.
Yep.
As long as he can see it.
As long as he can see it, he can hit it.
Yeah.
I really think we should secure that cart.
All right.
Yeah, but I would say we...
We could get more of our selfie guys and try to steal what's inside of it.
Okay.
And they two look pretty distracted, too.
And...
If anything, we...
Well, are you going to do it, then?
I guess it's...
So...
I mean, I can hit...
Purple D here.
Yeah?
And...
I'm assuming that either one or two things are going to happen.
Either I can continue to hit D, C, A, and B...
And they're all sort of...
Not even notice I'm hitting them.
Or...
That guy's going to come out of his spot and attack us anyway.
Mm-hmm.
So...
As long as I'm a way to keep firing at them...
I do not want to fight this.
Honestly, I really much do not want to fight it.
This is what you were hired to do.
No.
No.
I mean...
I mean the demon.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You were hired to kill the demon.
Yes.
So...
Saying you don't want to fight it?
After that was when you were...
I mean...
We're here.
This thing?
We're here.
For real, man?
No.
I mean...
I mean...
I mean...
I mean...
I do not want to fight the whole crew.
Oh.
Okay.
That makes more sense.
I was like, what?
I do not want to fight all of this.
Well, there's only like...
Seven of them.
It's fine.
There's seven of them.
And you've got...
You've got allies in this.
Yeah, yeah.
Exactly.
Okay.
You're not fighting that entire...
If we start attacking this guy,
they're all going to try and head this way anyway.
To help protect him is what I would imagine.
They might, but they're...
They're currently engaged with the...
With the...
With the Iron Tide Regiment.
So it might be harder for them to get in there.
Yep.
But...
Yep.
Okay, so...
But also, he's engaged with them.
I think we just focus this thing.
Yeah.
We'll probably peel him at some point.
Right.
But...
That's my thought.
Okay.
Fair enough.
Nice.
Okay.
First of all, my opinion, I think we should just sneak...
Like, one more stuff you guys are trying to sneak in first.
That's my opinion.
To what end?
To sneak.
To see what it is or...
To see what the thing is.
And to take...
See if we can take it or the...
So you are...
So you are saying that you want to have one of the guys who can stealth try and stealth
through that.
Okay.
Like, those are five feet increments.
You would have to be walking right...
I'd have to be invisible.
It'd be like you trying to stealth between you guys here.
What?
What?
Are you...
Do you...
No, I'm sorry.
Okay.
I...
I...
I forget.
Well, no.
I like your...
I mean, I...
I'm not saying you shouldn't stealth.
I'm just saying, like, Bob, have a plan about what you're stealthing about.
Don't just stealth for a stealthing thing.
How much can you move on?
Five blocks.
Oh, five blocks.
So...
Like, each one of the blocks is five feet.
So he's got a range of 120.
No, I meant, like, as far as how far he can move on.
Oh, move.
Like, land-wise.
Yeah, it should be six, right?
You've got a movement of 30.
Uh, land speed.
30.
So it's six.
Six blocks.
Six, yeah.
And so he might be able to get you posted up behind one of these little tents to where you
might be able to stay somewhat hidden as you're shooting at the four around the cart?
My opinion, I would say if we're going to go after the cart, I believe we should take out
the green guys first and take out one of the green guys.
Six, and one of the regiment might go after a purple guy.
That could happen.
Yep.
Yeah, like, that's my idea with that one.
You would be attacking a guy in front of everybody else, though.
Like, if you try and peel off the purple guys, you can get behind and maybe attack one, um,
and get one down before the rest of them engage.
If you do right, right in the center, then everybody's going to know you're there.
Okay, yeah.
Just going along with your stealthing idea, if you want to keep things quiet, you want
to peel, peel off the back.
Okay, so assassination.
Yeah, yeah.
Peel off the, let's peel off the back first.
But, I mean, once, once battle starts, you know, it's.
Yeah, yeah.
Who knows what's going to happen, right?
Everyone has a plan until you get punched in the mouth.
Exactly.
Well.
Yeah, I would say, well, I would go with the stealthier stuff.
The stealthier tactic.
No matter what, on our first, on our first go around, none of us are getting close enough
to do any sort of attack except for Little John.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Well, maybe you with, with a spell or something.
Right, right.
Yeah.
I mean, let's, we can try to get as close as we can before someone sees us, but like,
I'll, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, my vote would be to go for the, go for the purple guys and, and then try and help
these guys by flanking from the back.
Sure.
Plus, that, that gives us plenty of opportunity to get to the wagon.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
Sounds good.
Yeah, I'll do that.
Okay.
What do we need to do, boss?
Okay, so, what, what are you guys, what are you guys doing?
Well, thank you for the back.
We're going to try and get to the purple guys.
We'll have to get as close as possible until we are, okay.
So, whoever has, whoever has the worst stealth, roll your stealth.
And that will tell me.
Probably going to be either me or you, Ian.
For sure.
Yeah.
You both have disadvantage with your, what's your actual stealth?
Well, my, my plan is actually, I'm not going to be stealthy with them.
I'm going to be, I'm going to be staying right here, keeping you out of that guy.
If, if he notice what taking up, so I'm charging, if he notice the wagon's being messy.
You're, you're not going to be able to get to him.
He's flying.
Ah, okay.
Ben, you're one of our hardest hitters that we have tonight.
Okay.
Yeah, that, that is love.
Yeah.
You're my sacrificial lamb.
All right.
Sitting right, big, big ass.
Sacrificial lion, you mean.
Oh, I'm hot.
I'm hot.
No, um, okay, so, Ian.
Your stealth is plus four.
Ramsey, what's your stealth?
Two.
Okay.
Ramsey, you're rolling.
Yep.
Oh, plus you have the...
Six.
Six.
Awesome.
Just about as anticipated.
Okay, so where are you guys going?
So before we, before we start moving real quick, as we've kind of been not long to be
noticed, I dropped a light on everybody because, you know, that's a bad idea.
But at this point, I'm going to recast a light on one of the arrows in your quiver and let
you know that one, that one glows.
I think that's where you're going.
Uh-huh.
All right.
So, you guys, what direction are you going?
Are you going this way?
Are you going this way?
I'm sorry.
Let me just have a...
No, I think I'm going around here.
We're going over here.
And do we hit that and go behind me.
That's a lot of...
I'm just thinking yonder.
Like, we're going to get spotted.
100%.
Yeah.
Like, stealth is only going to get us so far, which is not far.
That's my vote.
Because, like, also, there's more pearl-bound around here, I imagine.
There are.
Right.
Yeah.
I mean, these are the ones that are most engaged at the moment, but there are more pearl-bound
around.
So, like, we can use these things.
Like, there's a lot of cover in here to try to weave in and out of, is my thought.
Yeah.
Agreed.
And then, as soon as we get spotted, they just gave on.
Yep.
Okay.
So, we got two votes for that.
We got one vote for going around.
Ryan, you're...
Where are you at?
We, uh...
Yeah, I'm just...
We're charging...
I'm giving my distance myself, because I'm the shooter.
Yep.
Yep.
But...
Where's your sniper perch?
It does look like I can at least delay...
I would say, I would say, I would say, I would say, I would say you go on top of the building.
Like, if you decide from anywhere, from this old boy and Joe, go on a building and be a true
savior.
Well, that's his decision to make.
He can do whatever he wants in that.
So, you were saying you wanted to go here or here?
Is that what you were thinking, Ryan?
Yeah.
Okay.
So, I'm going to let you just...
Toward the backs.
Maybe he'll perch me right here.
Right here?
There you go.
All right.
So...
See everybody.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And from that spot, you pretty much have a pretty good line of vision of everybody.
And you guys are kind of trying to sneak your way in here.
You get to about...
About here.
Mm-hmm.
Um, actually...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Except...
About here, because you weren't heading that direction.
You weren't heading that direction.
Right, right, right, right.
Right, right, right.
So, you...
You start walking out here.
Yep.
And right at this moment, like, um, your chainmail just, like...
Clank.
Clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank.
And you are noticed.
Now, I need everybody to roll me some initiative.
Okay, I need everybody to roll me some of these, like, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank, clank.
What is...
10?
10.
Okay, bye.
I need to begin with that.
22.
Nice.
Nice.
There's 22.
Oh.
Okay.
Oh.
12.
12.
Wait, maybe I told you I'm wrong.
Um...
I'm sorry, I got a 17.
17.
My goodness, you must have rolled terrible.
Well, I rolled 11.
Plus, what, you're saying plus one?
No.
Oh, that's intelligence?
Initiative is right here.
I just did the same thing.
Ian corrected me on that one.
Yeah.
Okay.
So I got a 17.
All right.
Man, can I really not read?
Yes.
No.
No, I seriously thought that's what it was too.
You can't read.
But, uh, yeah.
It's...
Okay, okay, okay.
It's int and init.
Very easy to, very easy to fall into that.
All right.
So let's...
Okay, okay, okay.
It's int and init.
Very easy to, very easy to fall into that.
Excuse me.
All right.
So let's...
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So let's go ahead here.
Start ourselves.
Oww.
Oww.
Oww.
Owww.
Oww.
Oww.
Oww.
Oww.
Oww.
Oww.
Oww.
Oww.
Oww.
Oww.
Come.
Oww.
Oww.
Oww.
Oww.
Oww.
Oww.
Oww.
Maybe it's because I'm used to sitting and staring straight at it.
It just seems super dull.
I didn't bring it, but you can turn it over to me.
My old eyes, my old eyes are having a hard time, sonny.
I had to get my 11 inches of snow removed from my driveway in Ohio, so I hired the neighborhood
kids.
These 16-year-olds showed up, they were done in like 9 minutes.
I was watching them, I'm the old man, like on my ring camera, I was watching them, like
dude, that's the left side of my back to be thrown out.
I was working the side muscles, and I'm like, dude, you are not 40.
Yeah.
Alright.
Alright.
Um.
Yeah, moving stone is no joke.
I think the computer decided to...
Yeah, that happened.
Mm-hmm.
See, I had to have you mess with it.
No, it wasn't that.
It was already, it was already smoggy.
Already acting finicky.
It was already giving me trouble.
It was all its way out.
Oh, goodness.
Oh.
Yeah.
It's already smoggy.
It's already giving me droplets way out.
There it is.
Enough.
Yeah.
Ah, technology.
The tabs open, I think.
Control paper, delete everything.
Pull it down.
I love PCs. I love PCs. I love PCs.
PCs are my favorite.
They, they, they...
It is kind of remarkable.
They are delightfully quirky.
There you go.
By delightfully quirky, I mean not at all.
Okay.
Okay. Well, we'll go ahead and like, I, I'm pretty sure that
I, we had Arthur, Arthur and Xander first.
Anyway, so if you guys have an idea about what you want to do.
Okay.
Um, we can go ahead and move forward with that while I'm getting this all worked out.
I'm looking at, um, sacred, sacred light.
From this.
A 30 for, burst for aberrations, fey, fiend, or undead.
Charisma saved versus blind for one minute.
Oh.
Uh, you aren't 30 feet away from any aberrations, demons, or undead.
Fey, fiends, or undead.
So, that would not do you much good at the moment.
No, I mean, I'd be, uh, like, move up and, and do that when I get up there.
None of those are demons.
You know, we're all, these are all humans?
Yep.
Um, this is a demon thing.
This guy's a demon.
Probably.
All indications point to that guy.
Sure books like one.
Yeah.
All indications point to that guy.
It looks like a duck.
Yeah, but Quack's like a demon.
Right.
But he's up in the air.
He's not 30 foot, he's not 30 foot away.
Demon duck.
Like, anything that you want to do to kill you some demons,
um, that stuff you're going to have to wait for when you're attacking the big guy.
Uh huh.
The rest of these guys are not demons.
They're split up humans.
Or fate.
Or humanoids.
Yes.
Okay.
How high in the air is that guy, just for the curiosity?
Uh, about 60 foot up.
Okay.
So I can't even use it on the guy?
Well, not when he's 60 foot up.
He wants you to fly.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm just, I'm just saying, man.
You'll have to toss me.
There are tactical decisions that will need to be made at some point.
Yeah, yeah.
And there's probably an opportunity for you to use that in this battle.
Yeah, yeah.
It's not this very moment.
It's not this very moment.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I, I forgot.
I thought they were a little bit more demonified than the other, than the other cultists that we came across.
That's, that's why I thought that may have been true.
I, okay.
I don't, I don't think that there's anything that I said that would have indicated that.
But if there was, I sorry.
Yeah, and you actually did indicate, you actually did indicate.
I said they were cultists of a demon.
No.
But I, what, what did I say that, that keyed off that?
Because, because the last time, the cultists looked a lot more rather than half the horns.
Yes, but if you remember last time when you tried to use demon stuff against those cultists, it didn't work.
Yes, but you also did mention that, if, if we go up higher at the right, there might be more, they might be more demon types of stuff.
Alright.
No, my, sorry.
Yeah.
Okay, sorry, um, these guys are cultists.
They are not demons.
Okay.
So, do whatever you would do that kills humans.
Okay.
Or monsters.
Probably don't want to be walking around trying to kill humans.
In general.
Okay.
Good idea.
Alright.
Okay.
I think, what, what.
It all worked out.
Here we go.
Woo!
And we're back.
And we're back.
And we're back.
Alright.
So.
Okay.
First off, we got Arthur.
Yep.
We're still, still waiting for that decision.
Oh.
Sorry.
That's good.
I think it'll be easier for him to see.
Alright.
Let's see if we can.
Let's see if we can.
Super.
Okay.
I think I'm both.
Okay.
I want to, I want to backstab somebody.
You can't.
No.
I mean, I mean, I want to get somebody who is flat down attracted and trying to run, but
watch them.
That, that's, that's what I'm asking.
You, you have not, you have notified everybody of your presence.
Okay.
Everybody knows we're here.
Everybody knows you're here.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Um.
Okay.
If that's, if that's the case, then I'm just going.
You, you're, uh.
I'm going, I'm going to.
Your chainmail announce yourself.
Okay.
Then I'm just going to, I'm just going to watch up and go right, right in the middle of,
of everybody there.
In the middle.
What do you mean?
In the middle of the.
Here?
Yeah.
That's where you're going?
Yeah.
I'm, I'm trying to do.
Yeah.
30 feet.
Nope.
All right.
You're right there in the center.
Yeah.
What are you going to do?
Okay.
I was thinking about using.
I was using my.
I was using my.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm going to see a barbottas.
I say sanctuary.
I just need you to.
I double.
I just need you to.
You check that.
I'm reading that correctly.
Sanctuary protects you from creatures attacking you.
That's all it does.
All it does.
Okay.
Yeah.
Target.
Um.
Target within 30 feet cannot be targeted by attacks.
So you're running in the middle of all the bad guys.
Okay.
And basically saying you can't attack me.
So they're going to attack other people, not you.
Okay.
So that's not going to do you much good.
If you aren't already a target.
If you are a target, it's good.
It's good.
Do the.
Do the.
Do the.
I can't think of.
No.
More or less.
How did you.
Do they have a reach?
Like.
If we pass them at a certain distance.
Do they have.
No.
They're.
They're.
They're.
Five foot reach.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's.
Yeah.
That's a.
Typically.
Yeah.
I would.
I would.
I would suggest.
What.
Right now.
Because we have an immediate need.
Yeah.
Your.
Your first.
Your.
Your.
Your first.
Your.
Your.
Your first.
Yeah.
Indication here.
Is just attack something.
Okay.
Yeah.
You can.
You can spend your.
You can spend time in between this.
In.
In between your turns.
Sorry.
Figuring out like what you want to do.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I.
I'm going to attack the.
The.
The guy closest to the Halloween.
Uh.
C?
C?
Purple C?
Purple C.
I'm going to scorch over here.
I'm.
I'm.
I'm running up and I'm slinging my hammer down.
Okay.
So.
How about that one?
The.
The.
The.
The two C's and the two D's.
Are.
Heavily armored.
Combatants.
The A and the B are.
Rogue.
Combatants.
A and B.
Okay.
you're not anywhere near them you you're only attacking the the heavily armored
guys yeah so you're going after the purple seat yeah go ahead and roll d20
makes sense yeah which I mean no intents and purposes that's probably
where you should be as the paladin oh man your streak is over at the worst
moment all right so what you got here 11 does not hit an AC of 18 and you don't
have that much luck okay so that is and bonus action and my bonus action I am
going to because I attacked him I'm going to actually activate sanctuary sanctuary
is an action
there we go you spent you sanctuary
so you cast sanctuary so let's go ahead and do something to represent that
you get a fancy color
yes all right all right well that changes things what a sanctuary do they
can't attack you yeah they cannot target me but they can't within 30 feet they don't
cannot target me by attacks okay cool with wisdom says yeah which means they're just
going to attack somebody other than you okay cool cool cool oh we choose to kill
somebody else and if you attack later does that the gate sanctuary or how to sanctuary work
unless it does yeah unless you do an offensive action okay you attack somebody your sanctuary got it so
probably just for this turn essentially okay yeah cool cool cool um and they're going in between me and
and mystery looks like all right cool so what I'm going to do I do want
I want to start to use that all right so
it's a little bit better to do it in between turns no listen I don't think it's worth a small slot anymore so uh no we're just going to stand there I'm going to look back at little John I'm going to say John light him up I'll kind of like motion to the the light
the light the light arrow and I'm going to hold my action so that when he fires the light arrow
I'm going to use my divinity to light kaboom to bow everything up yep that's me sounds good
uh it has a name respect theme uh where is it I don't know all right
searing a radiance that's what it's called
so that we got we got one of the heavily armored guys he is going to continue to attack the green D is going to continue to attack orange D
yep
big D
um
next we have the purple B um which is one of the robed dudes
uh huh
robed
robed
robed
oh
oh okay
cool
cool cool cool
eh oh
bueno
now
he's going to have some need one
with a casting aspect
uh huh
not that
He is going to cast, let's see here, looking at you guys, you're making a big ruckus.
So Xander be Yeoman, so Xander be a target.
Sure, makes sense.
We are going to do...
Xander, I'm going to need you to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, please.
Dexterity?
As he casts Sacred Flame.
Ah, yes, Dexterity, I see.
Ah, 14.
Sick.
Well, that's 10.
We like it.
That will still cost you 1 point damage.
The eagle.
Good roll.
Good roll.
I'll take it.
And then, a pitchfork is going to appear behind you.
Oh no!
As he casts Sacred Weapon.
Yes, yes, I noticed.
A spiritual weapon, not a sacred weapon.
It's a good trick.
Wow.
And the pitchfork is going to try and pitch you.
Yeah, it is.
Did you get it pailed?
Maybe.
Ah, well, does a 17 get you stuck?
It does not.
It does not.
It glances off your armor.
Ting!
All right.
Mistral!
Yes, sir.
You are up.
And then, Lil Jon, you are on deck.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
Mistral!
Yes, sir.
Yeah.
You are up.
And then, Lil Jon, you are on deck.
All right.
you are on deck. Alright, so we are going this way, maybe 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and then we are going to attack the D there.
Alright. And I'm going to use my Thunderfist hand wraps. Oh yeah. So I'm rolling a D20, right? Yep.
That's actually two D20s because you have advantage at the moment. Oh yeah, because of the flanking.
I just talked to you about that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So roll those two D20s and pop, pop.
Give me the biggest of the two. 13? 13 plus.
What happened to that? Is that mine? Yeah, it might be down on your weapon somewhere.
Maybe you have your hand wraps listed on it. It's not on the back. It would be your unarmed.
Oh, okay. So 19. 19 hits an 18. Which also, I don't know if you refactored one of your decks
went up, but it's probably, it should be a plus six, seven now. Yeah, it should be a seven now.
Oh, okay. Yep. Everything decks related is going to go up by one of your damage too.
So he says that he has a 20. Yep. So a 20 still hits a, it still hits a, uh, 18. So.
And then my damage, my damage will go up to a plus four then? Or a plus five?
Uh, yeah. Plus five, yep. Yeah. Okay. Yep, yep, yep. So that's, that's also for you too, Ryan.
So on your longbow, your attack bonus is actually going to be a plus seven. So wait.
And your damage is going to be a plus seven. So my damage is going to be a plus six now?
Uh, because I, that's my one. If that, yeah, if you put your strength up, it would go up by one.
And yeah, it would be a plus six because it's a plus one weapon and your strength is five.
Okay. So then I'm using the, oh, so D four.
And will my, will my claws go up too? Uh, yeah.
My claws. D four and a D six. Yep. D four plus a D six.
D four plus a D six. Um.
One, two, four, yeah.
One, two, four, yeah.
And my damage will let go.
Four, seven, uh, twelve.
Twelve.
All right.
So you do twelve points of damage to him.
Which is great.
Also, because you are using your, your hand wraps, your thunderous fish hand wraps, the secondary
effect takes place as well, which reduces this guy's armor to 17.
Yeah.
Not 18.
Oh, yeah.
So I'm going to, I'm going to go ahead and just mark him so we can remember that the little red thing is, he has a armor class that was one lower than it was before.
Yeah.
Cool.
So.
All right.
All right.
Buddy, are you going to get bone detected?
Is this where I can use a technique point and do the clear and close?
Oh yeah.
Most assuredly that's nice.
All right.
Let's do it.
Uh, so D 20 again.
Yep.
Or both of them.
Yep.
More cats.
More cats.
This is where it gets real hot.
Pop, pop, pop.
Plus eight.
So I got a 13.
Yeah.
Which way are you?
Who are you attacking?
Right.
Because that would be, yeah.
So I'm in the same.
Yep.
Yep.
Plus seven, I think, right?
Yep.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I'm in the same.
Yep.
Yep.
Plus seven, I think, right?
Yep.
Yeah.
So I got an eight.
Well, I got an eight and a two.
I take the highest of the two, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So 13.
13, uh, you miss.
13 misses a 17.
15, I think.
Yep.
Seven and eight.
Or, yeah.
Oh, I'm really not mad at that.
This is why games are good for kids.
Yeah.
Yeah.
15, but that still doesn't.
Still doesn't.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
But you need a lock.
Oh, yeah.
I need a lock point.
Oh, yeah.
By the way, I need a lock point.
So then I'm going to roll again for the second.
Oh, yeah, because you missed.
Yeah, you missed.
You get a lock point.
Please do remind me about those.
Yeah, yeah.
Come over here.
I'm juggling so many.
Uh-huh.
So 12, 9.
So there's 21, 28.
Yeah.
28 to hit?
Yup.
Yeah, that'll hit.
Oh, it's going to do the same thing because of the.
Eight.
That's a 13.
Uh, 13 points damage.
That's right.
Excellent.
Does that lower his AC by another one?
It does not.
It only works once.
That would be great.
They're like, Jason, just go swing on everybody a couple times.
All right, all right.
All right, so.
Stack that debuff.
This guy is.
You have knocked him.
Uh, you've knocked.
You've punched him a couple times.
You've knocked.
You've punched him a couple times, which really has given him a pretty significant injury.
But he is still alive.
All right.
All right.
Let's get another.
Cause that's one of the heavily.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cool.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
cool.
cially, heavier armored, you're too.
Yes.
All right.
Um.
So.
Yep.
Right.
Now, I know he has no, um, you knock him this guy and this guy has, you,emer,
he has knocked him, you have knocked him, you've punched him a couple of times, which
really has given him a pretty significant injury.
Um-hm.
But he is still alive.
All right.
All right.
That's good to know though, cause that's one of the heavily.
Yeah, yeah.
庶io.
Oh.
Apparently.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I can never walk the way.
Yeah.
that would make it bill john's turn yeah oh yeah the a guy what is he doing over here
that's uh it's a spiritual weapon we can't really affect it in any way
other than to kill the thing to cast it right there that's that's what that a's
yeah yeah it is attached to purple maybe i should switch it to a blue b
yeah sure so uh that makes sense so blue b is attached to purple purple b so if you kill purple
b blue b goes away yeah beyond that there's not much we can do about it yeah all right but it's
also you know and you want me to fire this arrow i don't worry about it yeah yeah reshoot someone
do what you do so i should shoot a little stick with b here sounds great to me all right
oh my enchanted arrow of light i spoke it up and i'm like i hope you remember what this
guy told me to do with this thing i got my pinning shot in my mystic mark
yeah i i would personally i would hold on to your mystic mark until you're fighting the
big baddie um because you have a limited supply of mystic marks so you can only do that i think
twice a twice a long rest so oh okay you know that's something you want to right right right
you want to get that you want to get the big for the big boy good advice good advice from the uh
yeah narrator uh i mean you can do what you want if you want to if you want to nova this guy
absolutely go for it but uh okay so then that's just the plus two
yeah all right rolling my d20 yep
oh i mean that looks really good to me but i'm not sure i'm reading that right
it's either a 19 or a 10. let's say it looks like 19.
sick all right so you definitely hit him don't even need to do the math because your natural roll
beats his armor class of seven all right so um so now you take your damage dice so on the long bow
you got a d8 that's this thing it's trying uh no that's the d4 but you do have d4 as well it's one
of these so it's that one and the um and the big one with the equilateral triangles is that's d8
um so you roll those and then you add them together and then add seven to that five plus seven is twelve
all right nice hit that was yeah that was pretty good what jody uh what glider would you
all right uh he's he's not dead yep i'll take my take my action my held action as the arrow flies sticks
into the guy um uh uh yeah um zander will cry out um oh what does it make the rain um
and for probably the first time actually i think he's actually put some emotion behind it because
until now he's been pretty like low-key you know um um whatever he speaks his his verbal components
but here like not a lot he's not like super into it but um but he says uh because he's a little
excited uh for the first time in a long time um bill exclaimed some of the effect of you know like the
the light of moraine burn you all um and i need all of these guys all six of them to make a constitution
okay well i'll do the do the heavily armored guys first
uh
c uh dc all 16 16. that's a miss for purple d purple c
um purple c succeeds
uh green c fails
green d fails so the only success that we have is purple c so far
i'm just gonna make sure i note that
is that in your favor or their fear
oh that's that's a lot of things so far it's definitely not in their favor
um basically he hit these guys
all right constitutions
all right um purple b
that is a miss and
i don't think this one would be much better
but it's not worse so
purple a
and that's a miss
all right all right so purple c satira everybody else failed excellent
okay
oh
he's the elite soldier in the group
yeah yeah yeah yeah it's just kind of kind of does what he does absolutely
what was that okay yeah a giant flash of light uh 10 damage to the success 21 damage
to all the failures okay and 10 damage to the success okay uh all right i believe it's a radiant of that matter if i'm double checking that
yeah what you need though yep wait
yeah yeah
no we didn't have their attention before
your buttons now
a missing demon pulmonary is not happy with that
is not happy with that
that's fine bring it on
don't mind me i'm just a seven foot one orc shooting at you
if you're right
you can't see me for some reason
the light arrow
i hope so
he got messed up
big old
lion wearing
whole plate runs up to him swings at him
monk comes up beats the crap out of him
okay
get shot with an arrow
blown up by some light yeah he's not doing he's not having a good day
um
what was our other it was these three that are
the heavily armored
okay yeah
no uh three no that guy yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah
everyone but these two guys in the back
guys in my head i already took that guy ahead yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah like in my head
it's already gone yeah
these stands for done skis it's so much easier if somebody just didn't do all this damage to
i mean all of the guys on the battle
you guys are go past you
you keep
you keep handing me these eerie situations
i don't want to tell you
you saying this is my fault
no no i'm just saying i'm gonna take advantage
big d out of here
and you can do that that's once a long rest right once a rest
once a rest i just need a short rest and it's ready again it's kind of dull
i think i think it's brilliant versus a single enemy it's not very good it's good but you know
right but versus six battlefield oh man we needed a moment of silence for big d over there
big d over there he did here you go
no one down
okay
it could be dumb
d for dump
perhaps that new macbook could come out that's 700 bucks
this is the macbook if it was a macbook it would work
that's what i'm saying you know
that's the cheap the new macbook is supposed to be expensive
that's better yeah that's better
you say it's supposed to be inexpensive or yeah it's supposed to be the
the big that's better but it's supposed to be the new mac coming out it's supposed to be the
iphone 16 pro so the same chip in this in a laptop and this would be the cheapest laptop
apple to grab that's the rumor anyway huh what did that actually happen it's the ram prices have gone kind of crazy
you know what i'm gonna say
okay so the moment apple's more expensive laptop for the cheapest thing running's at it
they were already kind of price time and that ram up reads anyway
i don't know what detail do and half their tips are incredible and then they have the other half
they're terrible and then they just jumbled up the skew numbers and i'm like just just take that pile
of chips and throw them away or rebrand them to something else all right but get back in the game
but amd and is mopping the floor here with the with the not to mention that the 13 and 14 generation
are under vaulted slowly die
i have not looked excited
no you're good sorry it's my fault you can believe me
it's actually not your fault you're the guy that you're you're the guy that fixes these computers
so it would be it would be uh un unwise for me to blame you about before my own problems
you're about to
if i could if i could just be running a linux system i would be okay with that
anything but windows anything
totally just played the windows 98 opening screen
i think when i was tech kids was trying to get these kids out of college to try windows 95
trying to upload like what is this thing they're like that's the calculator like you're kidding me
that's the calculator well it was revolutionary
it's a thing but
it's like hold on
as crude as possible
so no one guy's like you're pregnant this is mine sweeper this is the game that they're all talking about
i don't remember they spent hours clicking those little bouncing around
they used to my speaker was the ship yeah
so it used to keep me busy on slow retail days
so i replaced my uncle's computer with an ipad
and his only question not is it wireless or this no no the only question is is does it have my microsoft solitaire
and i said actually it does there's an app from microsoft for the iphone that is literally the
same solitaire that's crazy and i already had it on his device
that's amazing
never mind that you know hd's touch screen everything else
right never mind all that stuff right
then they play solitaire from 98 onward
yep
yeah i always feel foolish too because you know like i just bought my new pc i don't know last year
or something like that it's like not super beefy but it's pretty powerful
most days i sit around and play 20 year old games
you know what i mean it's like i play yeah here we go 64 like it's right right
a new game it's like christmas came early right
dude i might have to get one that one was loving that thing man dude
that mario kart 64 amped up which is like pretty sure
somehow they know how to break the like get the game into its individual files and then they can
recompile anything they want so this mario kart amped up has like the original game has the cups
which are four levels each yeah yeah this has a whole other set of those okay plus it's got a
like super cup thing uh-huh and then it's got battle mode during the race
so essentially that's so cool the balloons yeah yeah so you have balloons in your race and if you
take somebody's balloons out you kick them out of the race that's awesome and uh so there's the
battle mode racing and there's also traditional battle mode and
uh oh and they have different um uh like a bullet and a different things in the letter box whatever
that little thing so they have yeah yeah yeah so things and then who knew that the 64 had a whole
like 480i which at the time would have been like basically their hd version of graphic yeah yeah but
what's cool about it is is the nintendo hardware can show it but the software that they have for most
of the game engines couldn't do the mathematics to make the game sure well fast forward 30 years
and now you got you got all these advanced generators of code and generators of graphics
so you can make this phenomenal this you're playing mario kart as if it's on like the sega dreamcast
or something right 64. yeah yeah yeah it's all hd graphics and textures and all those different
pieces that would never have been impossible in 97. they just did not have been even conceived but
yeah yeah and the one guy was like youtube he's talking about you know how nerdy this is so you know
it was like notice when you jump off this ramp they now have you can control you have flight control
as you're like you know how somewhere yeah yeah like the super you control and you can turn that on and off
so like if you want to uh be able to steer your thing you know which that of course threw in a whole
new mechanic of like just kind of like super mario you can bounce and then it does like a double bounce
so these some of these levels get crazier and crazier just you know you know but i really liked mario kart
yeah i just don't like mario kart 8 when you go ahead some levels go upside down or on the walls
yeah just ever so slightly emotionally and i feel like that would go away on the switch 2 maybe but
on the switch one or the switch with the wii u or whatever those going upside down it's like the
graphics aren't quite crystal sure sure so it's just enough to be kind of like on a
call some motion signals a little motion yeah yeah yeah switch two probably fixes that but
who knew that for like 10 years running your car eight would be the number one game right
well it's crazy and we sell they have
odd job
yep i was always it was the one house rule i remember across no matter who i played with
everyone's like no odd job it's banned oh man he was great
it's the uh the story line's good and then the whole like hey i gotta get to like 35
bad guys but they're all kind of dumb they kind of do the same motions
like it it's kind of makes it you know it's yeah that retro feel yeah yeah
the comp has my current favorite level
or you start off in the cell or the bunker i guess whatever it is the
you start off the cell and you have to use your watch to get the key right right and then you get the
throwing knives out of the grate about so long since i played that game
played a ton of it back in the day though
first i was watching like 20 minutes in you know you just you're back there as a kid just playing
it's the nostalgia right and it's the analog 3d i got it is upgrading everything to
be compatible so you have a fluid you know high-deficient picture so you're not trying to
take a console uh you're gonna try to you're not trying to take a over crt and convert it to hd which
doesn't really work that well because yeah ironically the crts are like 350 megahertz or something
and so the refresher on a crt is analog it's like right these yep bizarre yep new ones so
yep and done uh well it's a little bit n64 level but i know like the 8 and 16 bit stuff
looks better on a crt because the pixel graphics were designed to be kind of you know blurred
so the analog but crisper like the 8-bit stuff looks the worse it looks which is just weird
you've got a sharpness you got you can choose different algorithms to go from two friday to
back to four all the way to 4k or whatever it is yeah yeah but it's but what's funny is is they have
the sharpness and you really want to keep sharpness at medium or even low right because it reintroduces
that kind of blur correction yeah you know um like you say otherwise it's like you're looking at a
really crisp image but it can't it's just the motion doesn't quite translate without it yep
yep yep this don't look right
well if they follow duty 97 they're whatever too however they're up to now and you can get yourself
right rock and roll absolutely
the golden gun
okay now we're good yeah assuming that ian doesn't die from the cuffs
not worth a bunch
yeah
you guys seeing who's up next is getting in the way of me actually being able to actually run this
game game yep sorry guys you're just gonna have to use your imaginations
yep
what do you mean we have to use our imaginations for this imagination game
yeah it's actually a trojan horse and uh 007 is in the crate yeah
he's got armor body armor
i want to say that they had they were in the first like 3d like they forget what it was where they get a bomb
you go into the dismantle you have to get the hostage and then you have behind the hostage is
a bomb yeah yeah shoot the guy right away and then shoot the other guy before they shoot the
hostage or detonate the bomb right that's a cool clever i don't know if there's a game that had that before
that yeah yeah yeah is that a first video games or is that
okay well yep
so um
a uh both a and b take a ton of damage they are still alive yeah yeah but only just sweet um
well not only just but yeah yeah
they felt some holy pain they felt some holy pain
that's what you get for being a demon cultist
that's what you get for being a demon cultist
i know we're going to wait for you
i know we're going to wait for you please
just show them the light yup yup yup yup yup
well i showed them all right
um okay so next up is
the uh other is purple a
uh
wait how are the two green ones doing
what how are the two green ones doing everybody else took full damage yep
they hurt yeah they hurt yeah but these guys are a lot if if you're wearing a dress
no you don't take a lot of damage if you're wearing metal
you can handle a hit yep it's generally how it goes usually
oh
so
um
and speaking of retro games I'm excited I never played it originally but they remade
Final Fantasy Tactics. I'm finally going through and completing my playthrough Baldur's Gate 3 finally
and after that well after that I'm gonna go back and play cyberpunk which I've only never played
my Final Fantasy Tactics is on the list now that it's re-released
so this guy is going to move over here
and he is going to cast Cure Wolves
aww you jerk
on his buddy or on himself?
on his buddy
aww look at him
me being selfless
that's almost admirable
he sees the writing on the walls
perhaps
and the guy that Cure Wolves was cast on is now only bloodied
the guy that Cure Wolves was cast on is now only bloodied
the guy that Cure Wolves was cast on is now only bloodied
the guys continue to fight the guys and exchange blows is being made
oh man
oh man
man
oh man
oh man
not really doing
and it's really me
end B
oh man
Okay
Oh man, not really doing a whole lot of damage, but damage is being, blows are being traded
and now it is the demon's turn.
Oh yeah, you should not forget about you, I won't worry about it so much, or Shiba, you're
about the other guys, backsliding and exploding, he's a moraine or something, he is going to
use a legendary action, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, his legendary action allows him to
move his full speed without provoking an attack of opportunity, and he's going to fly in,
20, 25, 30, 35, and he's going to attack both of you.
Alright, bring it.
Purple is Ramsey, yellow is Ryan.
Alright, does a, I think he missed Ramsey, um, does a 15 hit?
Me?
No.
That was for me for a 14 base.
Uh, he has a 23 to hit you, so yes, his 23 will definitely hit you, 14.
Um, you take, um, 9 points of slashing damage, plus 4 points of psychic damage.
So, a total of 13 points of damage.
41, where I 13.
Alright?
Yep.
And, 5, 2, 3, 2, 3.
Now that's still without provoking, because of his action rate?
Still without provoking, yep.
Cool, cool, cool, cool.
Cool.
And, he's going to attack you guys.
Sanctuary does not prevent you from getting hit by legendary actions.
Legendary actions break all the rules.
This one says he moves his full speed and attacks everybody.
Alright.
So, uh, bye.
That includes you.
You got, you weren't attacked by anybody else over there.
But, this guy is a boss monster.
And, it's looking pretty good for both of you.
So, the minimum is a 20 to hit.
And, 20, so, I think that you're both going to get, uh, both going to get smacked.
Alright.
And, that is for 13 points of damage each.
Okay.
From his pitchfork.
Um, he is currently on the ground, though.
Uh-huh.
Oh, good.
Excellent.
Um.
Oh, and, he gets to take his regular turn now.
Oh, shit.
Um.
Well, we got his attention.
Yep.
Good news.
Yep.
Yep.
If we know how to get him to look our direction.
Well, at least I'm safe.
He's on the ground, and this is normal.
So, Sanctuary will activate now.
Well, that's good for you.
Yeah.
It's not good for me.
It's terrible for him.
Yeah.
Because you have Sanctuary active, all the damage is going to go on here.
Which means you might have killed him because you have Sanctuary active.
Sir.
Just for the record.
It's not all about you.
Sir.
I was going to...
Alright, he's going to claw you and side you.
I can make now.
I can make now.
Sure.
Anyway.
Well, that's good for you.
Yeah.
It's not good for me.
It's not good for me.
It's terrible for him.
Yeah.
And because you have Sanctuary active, all the damage is going to go on here.
Which means you might have killed him because you have Sanctuary active.
Sir.
Just for the record.
It's not all about you.
Sir.
I was going to eat.
Because...
What does his side eat?
Get away me.
You get...
Oh.
Well, his claw definitely hits.
His side?
Probably not.
An 11 to hit.
And that's your armor class.
16.
Seems unlikely.
Yes.
Okay.
So his claw does hit though.
Which does 8 points of splashing damage.
And because you are large or medium or smaller, you are now prone.
So you've been knocked on your back.
Okay.
And then...
You said 8 points?
How many points did you say?
Oh, um...
8.
Okay.
It's just 8 points of damage.
Okay.
So...
So...
But we'll...
We're using that black, uh...
That black thing to signify that you've been knocked home.
What that means is...
You...
In order...
You have disadvantage for every attack that you make while you're on the ground.
However, if you stand up, you're able to be fine.
Standing up will take half of your overall movement.
So...
For you, it's probably not terrible.
Cause you're in a pretty decent position.
But...
Could be really detrimental at some point.
Okay.
Somewhere.
So...
But...
Yeah.
And...
Yeah.
And...
Yeah.
He...
He doesn't attack you for that.
Um...
But...
Yeah.
Like...
Kind of like in...
In these group situations...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You can really screw over the other people.
Sorry.
Sorry.
So...
I'm not...
I'm doing it more or less...
Uh...
No.
I understand.
I understand.
But speaking of...
It's your turn.
Yes.
What are you gonna do?
Okay.
Hold on.
I'm gonna be...
Okay.
Keep moving...
Over to him.
Over to...
Him?
Yeah.
Okay.
Like that?
Yeah.
Like that.
And...
My...
I'm...
I'm going to...
After that...
I'm going to...
To...
Activate...
Um...
Serenity's...
Light.
Serenity's...
Light.
Serenity's...
Light.
Uh...
Okay.
Challenge Divinity...
Sanctifying Light.
I'm sorry.
Sanctifying Light.
Uh...
Okay.
So you're doing the...
Demon's gotta make a...
Uh...
Gotta make a save...
Or...
A con save...
Or...
He's blinded?
Yeah.
Or he's blinded.
Okay.
And after that...
I'm guarding.
Fall for me and him.
Okay.
So...
He has advantage on all magical effects.
He has magical resistance.
So...
What's your DC...
What's your DC for that?
Um...
It would be your...
It'd be on your magic attribute.
Um...
Sure.
So...
At the bottom where your magic stuff is...
At the very bottom.
Uh...
You should have like a save...
DC in there.
Save...
Uh...
Twelve.
Twelve.
Okay.
So he's rolling two.
Taking the best.
Um...
And it's a con save.
He's got a plus eight.
Ugh.
He passes.
Yeah.
Eesh.
Um...
So...
Um...
So...
Yeah.
So he's not blinded.
Um...
And...
Also something...
It's...
It...
It has been established.
He's a legendary monster.
Something that...
You should know.
As well as...
Everybody else.
I think you're the only one who...
Doesn't know who's got like...
Save related things.
Legendary monsters have...
Legendary resistance.
Which means...
If they fail a save...
They can up to three times...
Just...
Save...
A...
Save on a failed save.
Okay.
Just because they want to.
Yep.
Um...
So...
That's some stuff to...
Some stuff to keep in mind.
They have built in load points.
They have...
The...
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Yep.
These...
These monsters be sick.
Um...
All right.
So...
You...
You...
You went over.
You...
You...
Tried to blind him.
Your...
Flash...
Didn't...
Didn't do...
Didn't do the expected effect.
However...
Uh...
You...
Uh...
Were able to set up your guard to hopefully...
Um...
Protect him next time.
And that was a...
Um...
That was a...
Yeah.
Offensive.
Yeah.
An offensive action.
So...
You are no longer sanctuary.
Yep.
Thank you.
All right.
And that makes it...
Um...
Xander's turn.
Yeah.
Uh...
Xander.
Uh...
5, 10...
15...
20...
Uh...
5, 10...
15...
20...
Uh...
5, 10...
15...
5, 5, 5, 15...
Uh...
How many times do I have?
Yeah...
Uh...
Challenge Avenity?
Yep.
Uh...
You can do it...
Uh...
I think...
I...
I...
I...
I...
I...
I...
I...
Milan...
The...
My...
These are limited...
Are limited by the number...
The proficiency bonus per day.
So for you it's...
Two of them.
So I can maybe do that one more time?
Right.
Alright.
I move up to here.
Um...
And I'm going to cast...
Uh...
First level...
Burning Hands.
hands in a 15-foot cone perfect right there raise my shield and kind of like
this burning light rucks from the shield covering these guys the three of them
need to make reflex saves DC 16 for a deck saves whatever it's home you know
I do as it turns out I know what you mean just looked it up but I already forgot
well that's easy they're just straight rolls next one
that's terrible well if it makes you feel any better they all failed a little bit
but it's not good all five full damage to each of them we did not roll well that's me
that was more like a warm hand yeah exactly exactly all right points nonetheless
all right well see he's gonna see what's going on
I'm just gonna move on up to um to Arthur
he's going to be attacking with his greatsword at once
um 17 will not hit right no 23 will so he's going to he gets you with one but not the other
yeah okay so we'll just roll one more and see if he still hits
so he does well actually I don't roll damage I just use average damage he does
he does 10 points of damage to you with his sword he slashes in here
next up
a and B are damaged because they were part of your light strike
yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
but B got healed a little bit
but B uh but A is not healed yet
so B is going to look at look at Mistral
yep and he's going to say leave now and never come back
I need a will save
which probably occurring to me that having the monk do a will save is not necessarily the best idea in the world but what's done is done
yeah D20 yeah D20 and we are looking for a spell a DC of 13 so you need to do a 13 or above
okay 15 yeah um well that did not do anything but had he succeeded you would have had to follow his instruction and burr left
um tells him to go and away he goes precious
come on come on come on come on Smeagal is free
and but Mistral it is your turn
okay so
Ryan has never seen the Lord of the Rings
yes
oh
oh
it was recently discovered and was uh very scandalous
yeah yeah yeah
it is basically about to die
but I am prone so you said that takes half of my attack
oh just do a bigger movement
oh
you are not about to die
no no no
oh
I'm talking about A is about to die
oh A is about to die
yes
A is
well purple A is
yeah yeah
yellow A is not about to die
no
no
no
purple A is about to die
I thought you were saying you were about to die
I'm like no no
purple A is about to die
no purple A is about to die
yes
but yeah I'm using all of your movement to stand
you're probably not moving a whole lot anyway so
yeah
but he is a monk so
yeah
he's got all of the movement things
right
right
yeah cause even half of him
20 feet
yeah
uh
well my plan was to go for a purple B but
that demon is right on my
right
side too
yep
and he is
and
there is
this attack of opportunity thing
if you move out of the
oh
demon's range
it will attack you
yep
hmm
it only has one reaction to
that it can do that with so
the first person to leave its range
it won't do that
but
yeah
but you could do B
I mean you could pop B and then turn around and pop A
you know
oh
although
A and B seem far inferior to A I mean if we just if you hit A I can hit A
start
start
weigh on on the guy
weight also
but
on the big A
on the big guy
if that's
but also those are healers back there too
ohhhh
healers
yeah
always ditch the healers
that's that's my opinion
out of the years
why is it we're there in that corner
am I able to do a healing potion at this point
for myself
that's that
yeah
that's a bonus action
that's a bonus action
okay
so you wouldn't be able to flurry of blows
but you can totally
do that
that's the only thing that's got me worried right now with having a guy on each side of me
I'm down to 16 hit points
right
yeah
and I feel like if I take a hit from big A I'm gonna be done
alright alright
well
I'm guarding yeah
that's fair
well that's true
he is
he is guarding
which me
and you are adjacent
so
whoever attacks you
has disadvantage
yep
for that
because of the guard
okay
so you're a little bit more safe right now where you're at
yep
and if you kill this one
then he won't have a guy on each side of you
that's right
well that's what I guess
when you just brought up the guard thing
yeah yeah yeah
that's what we're right
if you attack me and for some reason don't kill him
I can still shoot him
yeah
I totally forgot for him
I forgot him to use his spiritual weapon
oh
pissed off
alright
alright
let's take purple bee
yeah
get him
pop pop pop pop
oh I don't hit it so it's going to be one
because I'm not
we're not flanked this time
right
what is what is this
thing was a rake
a garden rake thing
spiritual pitchfork
it's a pitchfork
it's a pitchfork
it's a pitchfork
yeah
spiritual form implement
well it's more
it's more of a spiritual
I guess trident
yeah yeah yeah
it's like the
it's the um
it's the weapon that the demon is
can you take it from Aquaman
yeah yeah
does a 23 hit
a 23 does hit
um
it doesn't matter what
well
yeah
it doesn't matter what you're attacking
23 hits
all right
24
D4

young D7

D8
No, no, no, he got healed so it'll begin.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Pop, pop, pop.
Just saying, man.
You want me to just roll both 20s at the same time for my flurry of blows?
Sure.
Okay.
Keep it, keep it moving.
We are at 10 P by the way, so.
We got an 18 at the 19.
Alright, that's both, those are both hits.
And I'm pretty sure that he's gonna go splork.
And roll your damage separately.
Yeah, because the first hit might kill him.
Oh yes, because the first hit might kill him, and if the first hit kills him, then I'm gonna
let you use your second hit against the demon.
Yeah.
Well, he can't reach the other guy.
Yeah, yeah.
He can reach the demon.
Another 12.
12?
Yeah.
He gone?
He gone.
Alright, sick.
Get out of here.
Alright, so we're gonna turn around and swing on, swing out the big A hole.
Hole hole.
Absolutely.
Well, yeah, you already tapped him, so it's just damage.
Oh, yeah.
Yep.
One, two, five.
Another 12.
Sick.
Alright, so 12 does, uh, 12 gets him.
Um, he also should, uh, he also is reducing his armor class.
Oh, that's good.
Oh, that's good.
Because that still does work.
That's really...
That's really...
Oh, that's really...
That's really...
That's really...
That's important.
Yeah.
So his armor class was...
Um, was 16.
It is now 15.
Oh, yeah.
There we go.
Oh, yeah.
There we go.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
So...
Just...
Just so you guys know.
Yeah.
Okay.
Love it.
I guess I would like to just hit the little A.
Yeah, he's a healer, but you would have a hard time actually, he's on the other side of the wagon.
Like, you can't really line up a shot on that guy from where you're at.
Oh, and this goes away.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.
If you really wanted him, you could move to the outside of those trees or bushes.
I mean, you could always just lay your mystic mark down on the demon and start wailing on him.
Yeah, yeah.
I'll be trying to see my team.
As a ranger, you excel at secret target damage.
So get that target and do that damage.
So mystic mark is a, it doesn't cost an action at all.
It's just something that you turn on when you hit.
So, um, just attack the guy.
Um.
Alright, then I can also have this, uh.
And then you can aim one target possible PBI first attack.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
So you bonus action aim, which will double your proficiency bonus on your attack.
So if you flip over there, proficiency bonus is a plus two.
So you basically just add plus two to your attack here.
So instead of adding a plus, instead of adding seven, you add nine.
Okay.
And that's already handled in, in that, there, that plus seven includes the bracers.
So yeah, so roll a d20, add nine to it, and beat 15.
Yep.
Alright.
16 beats 15.
So there you go.
Alright.
And it's a good thing you aimed too, because you would have missed otherwise.
So.
Yep.
Yeah, yeah.
Um.
Yeah.
Alright, so now you roll a d8, plus two d4.
Eight.
What's this guy?
Yep.
Plus two of the pyramids.
Pyramids.
Alright.
Yep.
And then you add seven to, to the results there.
So, looks like you've got a four on the yellow one.
Yep.
The other thing is four, two, eight.
Yep.
Okay.
So that's 14 plus the seven.
It's 21.
21.
21.
Nice shot.
Boom.
Shoot him in the eye.
So you just did 21 points of damage.
He is, um, let's see, what's the, uh, he's injured.
Excellent.
Excellent.
Yeah, my arrow is right.
It's right quad.
Straight as Cooper.
Right?
Oh, gee.
Or, or is right quad.
Right quad.
Right quad.
Right quad is better than Cooper probably.
Right.
Light arrow really shocked everybody's butt all the way.
Yeah.
He had to attack me in the ass.
Yes.
All right.
Um, it is, uh, it's the, that guy's turn he's going to, uh, it's the purple A's turn.
A's turn. He's going to cast Sacred Flame on Misril, which means you need to
make a DC 13 reflex or con save. Dexterity is what I meant.
Sorry. So you roll the 14. Oh yeah. 20 beats of 13. So you take one point of
damage. And then he's going to, bonus action, cast Sanctuary. Sanctuary. Sure. You cannot hurt
me. So I've seen this trick before. If you use Sanctuary against me, I get to use it against
you. It's the rules. All right. We got the trading of blows with the Knights that are over there
and the other guys. And both of the Knights are starting to look badly injured. The two
green Knights are starting to look badly injured. Keep it up. Keep it up. They're just whittling
them down. The Iron Tide Regiment is also kind of starting to feel it though. So they're
looking kind of rough as well. Sure. You can do it. Let's see. Purple C is going to take
the flanking. The flanking with, um, Arthur. Or is he flanking? No, I'm not flanking. No,
you aren't flanking. He's flanking you. Like this guy is sitting right here. You're flanked.
No, he attacked me. He attacked me the last time I died. This is his turn back.
Oh no. No. Yes. I did not have a demon. Yes. This is what's happening.
All right. Um, a 19 will miss. Yeah. And it is the demon's turn.
Beautiful.
This is hot.
I need everybody in a 30-foot emanation of him to make a DC 15
wisdom saving throw I think that you are the only one who is not yes very yes
you good yeah 26 oh yeah I got a seven 19 19 okay
well
those that failed take six points of damage psychic damage those that passed take half of
that also also if you did fail you have disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls at the end of
your turn you can repeat the save ending the effect last for a minute oh yeah I think he
passed I had 19 I team yeah okay it was a DC was the AC 15 I did not hear what you said apparently um okay
so basically Jason what this means is this thing reached into your mind and pulled out some some
some shaming secret in your past which caused you psychic damage and is causing and is distracting
you from what you're from what you're trying to do as you're trying to deal with re-deal with the
trauma that was inflicted on your character okay so at the end of your next turn you can attempt to
make that wisdom saving throw again and if you hit a DC 15 you are recovered from that and you and then in
the meantime so in the meantime so far on my next turn my attack will be what'd you say
half it will be on disadvantage so you just all the two take the lower
the two yeah all right Ian you're up okay okay I'm going to divine smile that seems like a good idea
is appropriate yeah yeah I'm divine spanking this okay so what do I roll that's that's divine sense
that's not divine smite rolling divine smite you just attack yeah and then you decide after you hit
whether or not you smite it okay so just attack let's say I'm going to attack my warhammer and smash it down on this guy
oh all right
get him
okay
and that's uh 17. 17 hits 15 you hit him yep so with a divine smite what you have to do is you have to
actually figure out your um your spell slot so you already spent one spell slot for a sanctuary
yeah so that's gone um do you yeah I don't think you've spent any other spells so you've got two
other spells that you can use one of those um is now gone so you have one spell slot you use your
divine power from your spells to empower your weapon so now you roll 2d8 on top of your weapon damage
and since you are attacking a fiend I think that's an extra d8
first one
um it doesn't say on this but
and I'll check in
where divine smite
2d8 plus a d8 pretty total higher
uh damage increase by d8 if the fiend is a fiend or a landad yep
all right so you're rolling 3d8 on top of your regular weapon damage so you're rolling
fiend fiend
4d8 right now
4
for your damage
that is pretty good
4d8
some white
wake him back up
so
yeah
this
that and that one if you want to roll them together it'll make it go faster
faster yeah yeah fast is ruined upon the multiple
okay so that's four four
let's do it again
and that's another five so that's nine plus your strength strength
eight
bad
six
so that's 15 points of damage
yeah not bad he takes
I don't know if he's vulnerable to radiant but
that is a good question
but he might be
oddly enough he's not
fair enough
he's just not resistant to it
like I'm sure he is almost everything else
he's resistant to a great number of things
yes yes
um
but radiance is not one of them
yep
all right
cool
yep
and my bone attack chain I am going to
um
where it is
um
xander your own
okay
uh
while you're figuring that out
I'm just
prepping
can I add this to my thing
if I get it
in my favor
that's a different spell
so you have to cast that spell
and then you have to maintain that spell
every time you have a spell active
if you've got a spell that you're maintaining
every time you get it
no I mean you've got to activate this in it
no
no
no
okay
no
um
you could have
used your bonus action ahead of time to do
like I guess if you wanted to
but you'd be completely out of spell slots at that time
okay then no
um
which will remove your ability to do another divine spine later
okay
yes
so
so I'm just going to do a um
I'm just going to do a guard
okay
do it as a guard
all right
xander
so how's uh
how's Mr. Demon Boy looking?
uh
he is
badly injured
hmm
excellent
all right
that's what I like to hear
um
true guard
true guard
so
I think what I'm going to do
and write me on turn order
grossly
I think
um
Jason is between me and Ryan
is that right?
correct
okay
you got two bad guys
and then Jason
and then Ryan
all right
um
let's see
see
you don't really care about A at all
that guy has been largely ineffective
this guy
can't get hit
yeah
I think that's what I'm going to do
I'm going to hold my action
all right
I'm holding my action
to cast Guiding Bolt
uh
right before Ryan's turn
okay
okay
all right
give me some assistance
shooting that light arrow in
I'm going to give you some assistance
hopefully
it'll be good
all right
so we got um
the green sea is doing his thing
um
it's purple A
he's going to pop around here
he's going to cure
is he going to be a brave little boy
okay
he's just going to cast cure
he's just going to cast cure wounds
he's just going to cast cure wounds
oh that's fine
okay
I don't
oh yeah
I am perfectly okay
with him taking his actions
to cast some cure wounds
mm-hmm
that's a-okay with me
he's not a brave little boy
yeah no
no no
he's
he's
he's doing
yep
he's trying to stay behind that wagon
as long as possible
yep
yep
ms roe you're up
fighting that sanctuary
um
yep
we're just going to keep swinging on this dude
yeah
yeah
um
she said disadvantage so we'll both take a lower of the two
uh
yep
yep
um
and you probably do want to stand up
you are so prone
okay
so what does that take
uh
just half your movement
yeah
move it anywhere
that's-
that's not a good deal
okay
so I got a 9
yeah
I got a world of 18 in it
first
yeah 18 on the 9
yep
um so the 9's not gonna...
uh
well it might
with all of your
your
bonus to hit
cause you're like a plus 7 don't you
uh
oh yeah
sorry I was looking at the wrong one
so yeah it's gonna be 16
oh yeah cause he's at 15
he's at a 15
yep
yeah yeah
cause somebody hit him with the hand ranch of thunder
alright
mmhmm
I wonder who that was
Peekaboo
I see you
and basically what that translates into is like his armor just like you hit it and then just cracks start forming the armor which makes it more brittle and easier to hit
uh 14
14
14
she's
she's
okay
I forgot I was trying to sell knife proof vest and he stabbed himself into his own
thing with vest
uh
he's still kicking
oh yeah
oh yeah
he's he's he's a big bottle
he's not looking great but he's a big bottle
yup
yup
let's do the flurry of blows
yup
get em
first swing
uh double 11s so
yup

yup
that's still a hit
yup
that's still a hit
yup

you're trying to be like can I

uh
fair

yup
yay
lock

jump
great
oh yeah oh yeah well you're 20 and you're looking for wisdom dc 15.
nope this is this was a really traumatic event yeah yeah probably in your criminal days yeah
one of the things that kind of started making you decide maybe maybe you want to do something
straight laced a little bit better all right xander all right sweet all right uh i will cast guiding bolt
raise the shield and uh out of the symbol just laser beam of a searing white light flies out
and hopefully it's this jerk of a face all right here plus eight uh 15 plus eight that seems like
it's gonna hit that will definitely get it good lordy big bringing the bringing the firehouse over
here uh 12 14 15 points of radiant damage all right but more importantly uh it is now he is glowing with
that same light which is going to grant the next attack advantage so when you shoot it with your bow
you will get advantage and you are up all right now last time you hit this dude you hit him for
like 20 something so yeah that's why i wanted that's why i wanted to give you advantage 20 die to see how
that's why i wanted to do it yeah yeah no reason now too so that's a plus nine there's what you're
looking at there so what do you want oh and you also have advantage which means you roll another
roll again so that definitely hits but oh no no crit nope okay so when you have advantage you roll 2d20
and then you look at the then you find the one that rolled the highest and that's the one that you use
the reason why we wanted you to roll again even though you already hit is if you roll a 20 and you
crit then you will double the dice in damage which would be a lot of dice yes that would be amazing
right now yup but that being said even with your normal hit you're rolling a lot of dice so that's uh
two d4 and a d8 so two pyramids and two or just uh no i'll just uh just get the hat yeah yup yup yup
that's the ten the eight is the bigger sided one yeah that's it
four four
four whatever that only is one nine nine plus yeah nine plus your uh
your damage uh in your damage thing you've got plus seven to that so that's 16 16 points damage
plus my
yeah yeah i think i had a really good shot
you casted something on something yeah he was glowing he was easier to hit he was glowing
yeah so i looked at him yeah i fired my row and i hit him dead between the right between the right
the top right noise all right well you got him right in the right in the forehead there um he falls down to
the ground um breathes in and a shuddering breath that comes out and then he just starts to dissolve
into nothingness
go back to the shadow pretty much um and then
a
go back to the right
um
these guys are going to continue their battle yeah um but the these guys are going to pretty much
attempt to run or get cut down in the process yeah um this guy is going to
to disengage as an action yeah and then he realizes he's involved yep the lone wolf yep
leaders down run away okay now we got our way you guys um these guys are continuing to
fight against the pearl the pearl bound these pearl bound like once yeah those guys are done they kind
of just start wandering off but those appear to be continuing to um harass the iron bound yeah um what
do you do um i would tell them we're going to stop we're going to fix this and we need you guys help to
slow some people down
slow down the pirate or pirate they're they're still fighting the bad guy they're still fighting the
pearl bound yeah you you you cannot have a conversation with someone should check this yeah i'm gonna check
that oh okay so you guys look into the cart um or the covered wagon carriage thing um and inside there
you see a woman who's asleep who is dressed in the robes of marine oh well this will be fun do me and him
recognize her uh i'm gonna say no she's a she's a she's a random priestess of marine okay um you can roll a
intelligence to see if you see if you see if you recognize her but she has no name yeah
our significance is that she's a priestess of marine yeah she's alive though breathing she is alive
just unconscious just unconscious all right under a spell quite possibly well whatever they were
going to do with her was probably bad so that's good bet you're glad you didn't blow it up
oh like you were talking about i don't know one way or another when you guys were like i'm gonna blow it up
i'm being like okay
so yeah that's what you see in the cart um so that's what you guys saw zander um
zander little john are you guys doing anything else outside of that i mean yeah these guys are
still fighting i'm gonna support them as best i can okay um but how are you gonna do that oh i mean
the things are not hitting us i would say we're trying to walk up to the sea see what christy if we can walk up to them and maybe they will all those things are disengaging
i don't know sure you better try i'm gonna throw fire bolts out that's my plan well no we're gonna
not fire bolts we're gonna save your flame then okay okay so sacred flame you work uh it will immediately
emulate the one guy that you hit for sure um they do kind of move in a little bit yeah yeah
um little john you're gonna be doing anything we're gonna pop out of initiative order right now because
it's just more but we will be going around the table so we'll get back to you guys what you guys are gonna
be doing right after that
move out of my little spot there and then i'll shoot one of these
curl bow maybe that guy all right
you successfully hit and kill all right now i'm gonna make you roll for that yeah these guys ac is so
low you you got it all right ian what are you doing are there any more are there are they attempting
to attack more they the pearl bound will be moving in yeah i would tell i would get them
like i'll try to get their attention to stop fighting because they're just guards and they're
just guarding the temple and i'll tell them there's some pirates who wants to steal something that will
six seconds six six seconds six seconds that's the turn that's the that's how long you've got
before the there before they get overrun with more with more okay i'll take to leave them away from i'll take
you
i'll take you grab you're you're trying to solve something with logic where we need action okay so
like this we're even though we don't have combat here even even though we don't have like anything
happening here from a um i'm not doing initiative order we're still in combat rounds okay combat rounds okay
so think in combat rounds don't think in like narrative sort of thing so if you don't have
anything immediately then we can move on to jason you can think a little bit and we can get back to
you now if you're trying to get my next thing is to get to pull one and tell them about about the wagon
tell them there's a piece of marine in there the combat's over for you it's not for them okay so you keep
on trying to pull them away from the combat that like these things are trying to eat their faces okay
i'll get i'll get so okay i'll attack it i will throw a javelin at one of them to get to to get one of
the zombies away from them okay so you throw a javelin at one of these curl bound here kill it yeah okay
um jason these guys are moving in these guys oh they're moving over here i don't know if i can get
close enough but i mean i'll come try and take this last guy out just so we can free up our our friends
okay um let me see so you run up you can probably get there you you've got like 40 foot movements yeah
and you attack one yep kill it all right these guys move in excellent
these guys are moving moving in you wait wait where's me yeah you i know it's you oh no sorry i
lost track of my piece for a second oh where's you you are here sorry no no i lost track of my piece for
a second okay my my opinion is trying to regroup that's what i'm going to try to do i will kill the
guys in front of me okay so yeah the these pearl bound are like once you guys have spread out um they
are definitely moving in on you guys as if you were the iron tide regiment um okay so
well these guys are probably a little bit further out but
um these guys are
kind of a little bit further out but they're so that's kind of basically what you're what you're
looking at there um iron tide is basically trying to hold their own but they're doing
they're performing a tactical retreat because there's no reason for them to be here anymore so
they're trying to move back sure um but the pearl bound are like moving in um with you know in in
pure zombie style right so they're shuffling forward and they're you know looking to cause cause damage
but they're not moving like particularly fast so sure um as long as the rest of you kind of like
kind of move out with them you're probably going to be okay um the these zombies are so low that like
you know if you swing you yeah yeah yeah kind of thing so yeah i mean if we're staying i'm going
down swinging i mean that my game plan is just swing away if we want to follow these guys and
try and head out i'm cool with that too yeah someone grab the priestess yeah i've got
what's i'm going to pieces let's beat feet yeah all right so when we were together they were ignoring
us but if we're separated they come after us was that what you were saying chris well uh no you may
you may notice something if looking at the battle map as far as like who's being targeted yeah yeah yeah
so when you were together um they kind of like saw you and kind of moved off yeah yeah now that you
guys are a little bit more spread out yeah um you see that the people that are the furthest away from
xander yeah are the ones who are being assaulted while the ones that are closer to xander don't really
like arthur and little john are like they're kind of there but they're not like yeah trying to
yeah be eat your brains like the other guys absolutely but yeah i'll uh
sweet then yeah let's just stick together grab the priestess i'm gonna move in
some closer to the the tide watch so everyone to stick close and let's uh let's get the heck out of here
okay as you guys kind of circle around here um these guys kind of start acting less aggressive
they kind of move back i wonder if they think it's because i'm one of them
in a way i kind of am i guess
um but yeah you guys are able to move your move are able to perform a tactical retreat um
and you have a priestess in tow as well as the iron tide regiment um they are battered and bruised
and not looking the best in the world but um they are still all alive which is more than can be said
for some of the storm color cultists all right uh my first action i'm going to be giving them the rest of
my potions you're going to need those okay now i mean you can but these are these are npcs
you're you're you're going to be going you're going to be fighting something that's even more powerful
than what you just thought okay okay you're going into the into the into the danger okay they're they're
not okay right okay so good selfless good selfless thoughts just you know pragmatic yeah
i wanted to see if they ever talk to them and tell them we're going to try to fix this
with everything which found a problem and we're going to fix it but there are some pirates who
didn't want this to make it worse so let's just slow down the pirates you're gonna lie to them
the pirates aren't aren't trying to make it worse well as far as we know they take that thing away
well that's gonna make things worse yes but there's a difference of intent they're not trying
to make it worse well let me okay they're trying to get some booty yep they're trying to get some
treasure and don't realize it is cursed treasure and we're going to try to see if we can fix it
okay well you communicate that to them um and they're they're
they can go and try and get the pirates take care of the pirates
however you have this sleeping priestess yeah all right they they cannot do both
are you planning on dragging this priestess with you wherever you go
you can't just stick her in your pocket yeah yeah yeah she can't come with us i'd like to at least get
her awake before we leave her but yeah that can be uh but i mean with these three guys they're not
going to be able to do much if they're not all devoted to one of the tasks it's not like you can
divide and conquer with these guys they're they're in the tidewatch ward okay they need to travel together
or they will die oh god so you're not in a safe area you're behind enemy lines so that's something
that you guys that's something that you guys will have to figure out next time next time
that's fine um so next time you we will we will actually get into the the role play with the with the
with the iron time regiment figure out stuff going on there um i i like the the problem solving
mentality let's see if we can figure out like a way of being able to hold that into getting getting
a solution for everything um and yeah uh but xander you you definitely have confirmed at this point that
the only reason why nobody else has been attacked by the uh by the coral by the pearl bound while you
get inside the territory is there's something about you they don't they don't they don't i am returned
all right well guys thanks for thanks for playing yeah yeah sorry we're a little bit late
but next time we'll make sure to oh i i next time i will do my best with my computer and have to puke
out on me and do it for like a half hour right we'd be done already
all right all right all right we gotta get out of here thank you for running and posting good to
see y'all yep we'll see you later yeah we'll get a good one we're gonna have to say thank you
did he oh nevermind that's a little bit of place i forget you got the big wizard ball
make sure you keep your lucks your your luck points together so when i put them away i have those with you
that's a little bit of place i don't know yeah you you did succeed in your we'll see you ryan
okay um you did succeed in your goal into going into the tidy watch board i'm a little bit sad but
dave didn't make it today because oh that was also his character's goal
so it would have also made the combat a little bit easier
so yeah you really had fun with that one too
you guys did pretty good
and those hand wraps have been my saving grace
those are like those are like a effectively they're a legendary magic item
like they're better than the most magic items out there most everybody's magic items with the
exception of arthur
