Ryan, I'm going to chuckle every time I look at your character's picture now.
You're right.
I love it, though.
Man, I think I got it.
Any last-minute stuff?
Again, don't want to rush you, but I am good to go when everybody else is.
I'm going to transcribe it, but I'm going to get it.
Thumbs up.
Thumbs up.
Clear?
Clear?
Leroy!
You are in the city of New Penmaris.
This is what is left of the wreckage of hold parameters.
Apparently, my volume just decided to die.
It was going for an ease out, but we had to talk.
It might seem to be a delete to that song.
What?
It might seem to be a delete to that song.
No problem.
No problem.
So, Old Penmaris was a city on a peninsula.
It had a thriving mercantile business, was run by a majority of the merchant houses, and was the pearl of the Shimmering Shores.
Then, the flaming revolution happens.
Okay.
The entire peninsula up was decimated, yet somehow, the area surrounding New Penmaris was spared.
It was spared.
It was not spared of destruction, but it was spared of complete decimation.
The layout of the coast looks more like this.
New Penmaris has been erected on the wreckage and the ruins of Penmaris.
You may notice that there are geological changes that have taken place here, even beyond the fact that this was once a peninsula, and now it's enough.
There are new islands to the southeast that have appeared.
There are a few islands in the northeast that were not there in the previous area.
The southern coast is no longer present.
It fell into the sea.
And this is the world that you all find yourselves in, a place of complete destruction a year after the flaming retribution.
Now, in New Penmaris, they are a resilient lot.
They decided to rebuild New Penmaris on top of the ruins of Old Penmaris in order to be able to prove that this is still a viable city and that it can still prosper in the midst of dark times.
However, six months after the rebuild reconstruction began, New Penmaris was visited by a Tidewatch, was visited by another natural disaster.
The Tidewatch ward, which is the Tidewatch ward, which is the ward that is closest to the open sea, was all of a sudden had a flare of light somewhere in the ward happened.
And then a storm cloud moved in over the ward.
Tidal waves and floods came, and then monsters came from the sea.
They are referred to as the salt spawn.
They invaded the ward, and the guard for New Penmaris did their best to keep the monsters at bay and to keep the city safe.
But they were unable to hold on to the Tidewatch ward.
They had to fall back behind a wall in the city.
So now, the Tidewatch ward is held at bay by a five-foot-thick wall protected by magic roots.
Everybody, there have been multiple parties that have gone into the Tidewatch ward.
Nobody has returned.
And generally, they've sent military units at this point.
They have since opened it up to bold adventurers to come in and see if they can take care of the situation because their military resources are running thin.
At this point, all they can do is keep the monsters out.
They can't make a play to retake the ward.
However, New Penmaris is seen as a beacon of hope in the region.
And so, there are many refugees who are flooding into New Penmaris to be able to receive aid and be able to make a living for themselves.
So, New Penmaris is growing larger than its current capacity for them.
So, they absolutely need to reap their ability.
You five have answered the call for whatever reasons you have to be a part of the attempt for reconstruction.
To take back the ward.
To take back the ward.
What the...
What the Iron Tide Regiment, which is the city guard slash military, land military,
have said, they have put out the call and you've answered it.
A few of you have some more personal reasons to want to enter the ward.
Arthur and Skirk, you have been given a mission by one of the town council to go and locate a demon that got summoned into Penmaris
and has disappeared into the Tidewatch ward.
If left unchecked, they may get to a point where they're opening a gate to the Infernal Plane itself.
And an influx of demons may come and destroy the entire city.
You two have been requested...
have been requisitioned to find that demon and destroy it before it can cause death and destruction.
You've harassed the guy with the horns to find the demon.
There are also other personal reasons.
Like, I mean, Arthur, you are...
You want to see New Penmaris become more successful.
Um, and become better than it was before.
And so, you are also wanting to reclaim the, um...
You're also wanting to reclaim, um, the ward to be able to protect.
Yeah.
And also, I've heard by...
My brother.
By rival.
You don't know anything about that.
Don't know anything about that?
Yeah.
Okay.
You don't know anything about that.
Apparently, my backstory did.
My backstory pointed out to my character, so...
You don't know anything about that.
Okay.
Okay.
You know something about that.
Your character doesn't know anything about that.
Okay.
So, let me rephrase.
Okay.
But, when I tell you that, I'm not saying it's not true.
I'm not saying it's not going to happen.
I'm saying your character has zero clue about this.
Okay.
Whatsoever.
Zero clue.
I was on the pressure that my character knew about this.
Knew about that.
That's why you get to protect me from the team.
Okay.
Um...
Jason, um...
For Misro, um...
There is an element of...
Like, there are treasure maps that you were able to recover.
Um...
You did notice that there were a couple that were pointing towards something in the, uh...
In the Tidewatch ward.
So, you were wanting to go in there, not only to protect the...
The city, but also there might be...
There might be some valuables there that you might be able to get.
All right.
What are we?
Um...
Little John, you are...
Um...
I'm freaked out.
I'm freaked out.
I'm freaked out.
I'm sorry.
There's a new substance that has appeared on the market that appears to have come from the Tidewatch ward.
People are referring to it as Coralite.
Um...
It is...
It is...
Some sort of material that appears to, um...
Grant...
Um...
Magical properties to armor and weapons that use it.
And give it the ability to do more...
Give it the ability to cause, you know, cause certain low-level magical effects and that kind of thing.
Um...
You are wanting to go into the ward because there's all...
Because, um...
With your background, having dealt with many giant, big monsters in your, uh...
In your, uh...
In your background, uh...
You...
The substance appears to be some sort of carapace substance.
So, it's something that you feel like you could go and harvest from some monsters and maybe be able to, um...
Provide some sort of protection for the city.
Great shell gem parts.
Little monster on...
Monster hunter, I just...
Um...
And Sander.
You're blue!
And the water is blue!
Sander, you want water?
You have a...
You have a friend.
Mm-hmm.
Uh...
Your fishing buddy.
Yeah, I do have a friend.
That is accurate.
About, um...
About a week ago, your fishing buddy all of a sudden disappeared.
Mm-hmm.
And your favorite fishing spot with him was right on the edge of the Tidewatch board.
Um, you found that, uh, it was, it was discovered that his tackle and his, um, and his fishing supplies were on a little bee that was just off of the, off of the pier.
Mm-hmm.
But he himself was not.
Your suspicion is that he might have been taken into the Tidewatch ward, which...
Um, maybe you want to go and check that.
Sure, sure.
Um...
So, each of you have a personal stake in this, as well as just the general, we will make you rich and we'll, you know, and we will reward for, for this.
Um, any additional, uh, any additional, uh, reactions to what I just gave you guys, um, in-character reactions or anything?
Just to clarify, it is the civil government that is sending people out, the adventuring parties?
No, it's the, it is the, um, the military.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah.
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
They have, they, they've run out of their own people to send, so they're sending...
Ah!
They're, they're like, we can't lose any more people.
We can't lose any more people we care about, so let's send these adventurers.
Here you go, here's some bullets.
One of you gets a bullet, one of you gets a gun.
I'm like, I'm gonna come off with that guy and keep going.
Speaking of...
And after, after you go and meet with the, uh, with the captain, uh, he sends you on your
way, but you are given three healing potions, um, to, to go with you.
Um, so everybody add three healing potions to your...
Oh, each?
Each.
Oh, full.
I need a pistol.
I need a pistol.
I need a pistol.
We're at best.
Do they have to go?
Yeah.
That's a little...
Ah!
What do healing potions yield in this game?
Uh, that's a really good question.
Okay, is it inventory, or is it...
Let me pull it up here.
I should have anticipated you asked that question.
That would be a...
It is really the obvious question.
It's ruined your current handwriting.
Uh, what is the inventory in this?
I'm just gonna go on and guess a D4 plus one.
That's my guess as well, but...
You never know.
Maybe they're generous.
Treasure...
Yeah, treasure and equipment.
Yep, treasure and equipment.
The second natural question is what kind of action does it take to use one in this game?
Bonus action.
Yeah.
I'm sure he knows that one.
Yeah, yeah.
Because that's something that I specifically looked up.
Right, right.
It's one of the things they fixed.
Because I'm like, everyone helps a little bit anyway.
Yes.
Uh, so you...
A potion of healing heals 2D4 plus 2.
Yeah.
Can you say that again?
Good question.
2D4 plus 2.
Thank you.
Right.
I'll do it.
Can you say that again?
How's that?
2?
D.
D4.
2D4.
Plus 2.
No, no, no, no.
All right.
That could be like almost all my hit points.
I would need at least three of those to kill all my hit points.
That's good.
You go in front.
Plus 2?
Plus 2.
Yeah.
All right.
So, you are requisitioned, you are given your healing potions, and you are sent to the gate
of the Tidewatch Ward, which is bordered by the Mariner's Ward.
The Mariner's Ward is alive with noise.
Hammers ring, gulls cry, and the air smells of sawdust and salt.
Half-built taverns lean beside the shipyards, still under repair, and the blue-cloaked soldiers
of the Irontide Regiment move through the crowds like sentinels of the order in the city
still finding its bounds.
As you head east, the sounds of the Ward fade, the streets grow emptier, and the air colder.
The wooden buildings give wage stone, and ahead rising from the mist, you see the Tidewatch
wall.
It's massive, slick with moss and sea growth.
Faint blue runes glow across the surface.
I can really leave you.
It's great.
Coming softly with old magic, Ward's meant to keep whatever's beyond them from getting
through.
A heavy iron gate sits in the center, chained and reinforced, with soldiers standing watch
nearby.
One man steps forward as you approach, broad-shouldered, weathered, his armor worn thin with years
of service.
A halberd rests beside him, and his sharp eyes look you over.
A halberd rests beside him, and his sharp eyes look you over with the weight of strength.
Someone who's lost too many in his command.
So you're the ones they're sending, he says.
Figures the regiment is out of volunteers.
He glances bad boil at the fog curling through the cracks in the gate.
Name's Frederick Wainshore.
I'm the one who opens the door.
He gives each of you a cursory glance, and says, glad to see they found some people with
experience this time.
A cool fight.
That bitch of a wavemister's tried to drown me once before, and she's welcome to try again.
He looks at you and...
Okay.
Now the thing you need to know before you step through that door is, I'm going to be shutting
it behind you.
You won't have backup.
You will not have any assistance other than what you carry with you.
What's in that ward?
That ward is six or eight miles square.
Six or eight square miles.
With the flash that everyone saw centered in the middle of it.
There are a number of monsters and a number of creatures that we have seen approach the
walls, which are smaller in comparison to some of the reports that we've gotten from
some of the people who can see further in there, the scryers, so watch yourself.
There appears to be something happening right now that is different than what was happening
even a week ago.
There might be something afoot.
As I've said, I've opened this door for many people.
I've yet to have opened it for anybody coming back.
Make sure your affairs are in order.
Why is he excited?
What does that mean?
I hope you said your goodbyes.
How do you have any questions for me?
How do we get back out?
If you make it back to the gates, our watchmen will see you and we will open providing that
you're not being chased by the entire, the entire dungeon or the entire ward.
I should say we will open it for you and you can.
Return.
Return.
Um, these gates, these gates are washed 24-7.
So as long as you are able to make it here alive, then we will let you in.
He emphasized the alive.
Well, wait.
Yeah, I can open the door.
Have you seen any undead?
Yes.
I don't know.
The Tidewatch Ward has many dangers.
Undead are among them.
There.
Well, that's my job.
Is there no fault for them?
Not that we are aware of.
You may find that there are.
You may find refuge in the ward itself.
Um, but we have never, as I've said, we've never seen anybody come back, um, alive.

Some of our, some of our better people in there.
Um, and there are people who did go in that don't like to see their, the job undone.
So they may have, they may have, um, pockets of, of stability inside the ward.
Um, we are unable to find them even with our scryers though.
So if they are, if they are there, they're very well hidden.
All right.
Good enough.
Yeah.
Um, if there are no more questions, then we'll get you, get you set up and get you in there.
Um, he, um, puts a, he puts a, um, a room token on each of your pieces, each of your armor
or scraps of clothing.
If you don't have armor, clothing, clothing.
Um, it's, it's basically just a, uh, it's a, it's a magic room that, uh, it, for anybody
knows anything about magic.
It's just a room of tracking, um, just so that they can kind of keep tapping on where,
where you guys are and be able to potentially scry you if they, if they need to, in order
to be able to, um, it, it, in case they should need to.
Now that strikes you kind of as odd since he's like, I'm not going to open the door for you.
Nobody's ever going to, you know, nobody's ever going to help you with that kind of stuff.
But this is kind of standard procedure for, um, a, for a, um, for us, uh, crack team to go in somewhere.
And if they need extraction, then that's kind of what's used for that.
My pants are glowing.
Uh, he does also outfit you guys with a, or give you, give the group a sending still, um, which is effectively a walkie talkie.
Um, so he'll, he has one half of the sending stone.
You have the other, um, for you to be able to communicate to him should, should the need arise.
Um, and with that, he said, he, uh, Frederick nods once.
And then, then the signals, and then signals to a pair of soldiers on the wall.
The great gate shutters open, scraping against the salt scored stone.
Um, and the smell of brine and decay seeps through the fog that rolls towards you in like a breath from a dying beast.
One last thing, Frederick says quietly.
If you see the fog move against the wind, run.
The gate groans shut behind you, and clang, and a clang echoes off the drowned building beyond, ahead, echoes off the drowned buildings beyond.
The head lies a street half-swallowed by mist, where shattered boats and carts lie stranded in the stagnant water.
Okay, let's go ahead and enter the dungeon.
Ba-ba-ba.
When the door closes, uh, Xander will kind of kneel to get down eye to eye with Skirk, with his shield with the symbol of Moraine the Tidekeeper.
Oh, this is gonna be interesting!
Before we start, I must know, you called her bitch. Is that really what you think?
Well, she tried to kill me once, so...
Good.
We'll get along just fine.
Excellent.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait, did she talk about God?
Well, apparently we are.
They are!
They are, and that's talking about Rain, the goddess of the priest that saved you off of this house.
That's in fact you there talking to me.
Okay, I'm the Tidekeeper!
Yep.
Whose symbol is on my shield.
Okay, which...
What...
What you're asking?
What's that word?
What's that...
What's that word for people who don't believe?
Or...
Or...
Is that what you're going for?
Yeah, I would call it spirit.
I'm not talking about.
Well, maybe...
Heresy is vague.
I worship her.
She's a manager.
Ish.
Worship ish, or...
Worship.
That's very bad.
Worship ish.
She's just leaving it at the ish.
She understands her power.
She's pretty mad about it.
Fair enough.
Let's go with that.
Yup.
Yup.
Oh, man.
So, uh...
Yeah, okay.
Okay.
So, you guys have that, um...
Have that exchange.
Uh...
You look out into the, uh...
Into the mist.
Um...
You see...
The...
Streets are flooded, but not...
Um...
They're not canals.
You...
You can very easily walk through them.
Even the...
Shorter ones amongst you.
Um...
They're definitely wading...
Um...
Wading waters.
Um...
As you proceed forward, um...
Um...
You get this...
Impending...
Doom.
This feeling of...
Of...
Of...
Doom and destruction.
Um...
By the way...
I'm gonna see...
I'm gonna try to track...
That...
That...
Track what?
Mainly the demon right now.
I'm not...
I'm...
I am...
Focused characters.
So...
Fair...
Fair enough.
But...
You have no ability to track.
My perception.
You...
Tracking is survival.
Uh...
Tracking...
Uh...
You...
You can't track nothing.
I can't...
Still fine.
You can keep an eye out.
That's totally...
I'll...
I'll...
I'll...
I'll...
I'll...
I'll...
I'll...
Well, you do have an ability that you can use three times...
Three times...
Three times a long rest called Define Sense.
And that will...
Allow you to...
For...
A...
For...
Six seconds...
Be able to...
Ping within 60...
60 feet of you...
To...
Determine if there's any demons that are within 60 feet of you.
Um...
That's your...
Really your only thing that you can use.
Um...
But you can only use it...
Three times...
Three times...
Per long rest.
Per long rest.
Yeah.
So...
You...
Need to...
Be very specific with that.
Yes.
Exactly.
So...
Figure out like...
If there's a good...
A good thing.
But...
It's noted...
You are on the alert.
You're looking for the...
You're looking for the demon.
Yeah.
Um...
That's...
That's fine.
Yeah.
My...
My character...
My character is a very...
Um...
Um...
Very focused.
Disciplined.
Yeah.
Disciplined.
So...
Yeah.
And you might be feeling some kind of way because you're...
You're...
The guy that you really, really liked basically just kind of called...
You know...
Not your deity, but a deity that you very heavily respect.
Yes.
A very bad thing.
I didn't say I didn't respect the deity.
It's very powerful.
Um...
All right.
So...
Okay.
So you're keeping...
You're keeping watch.
You're looking out, trying to see if you can spot demons.
Um...
The rest of you, what are you doing?
How are you proceeding into the Lord?
Um...
Anybody have any specific thoughts?
I...
I...
Am going to...
Because I have a vague familiarity of the Lord, because I kind of worked in this area
and was...
You did.
Yeah.
And...
So I'm gonna start...
Uh...
Leading the way to my favorite tavern.
To see if there's any remnants of anything left that's worth...
Because...
Let's be honest...
It's not a pretty...
Fucked up situation we all find ourselves in, and I could use a drink.
Fair enough.
And...
There's nobody working, but there might be some beer left around.
It's possible.
Maybe.
Okay.
So...
Follow me.
I know the best spot.
Yeah.
Someone starts walking and says, follow me.
I know...
You know, I know the best spot.
Um...
The rest of you, what do you do?
I am looking around...
Specifically for...
Some place...
Defensible.
Somewhere we can fall back to if we need to.
Okay.
Something that could be sanctuary if we need be.
Okay.
Um...
Go ahead and roll me a perception rule.
Uh...
Can I help him?
Because that probably will I also be doing too.
I would be...
I'm trying to find...
Well...
At this point, I wanna...
I wanna give him...
I wanna give him his...
Give him his role for that.
If you have something else that you can do to kind of add to that.
Yeah.
That we can...
Do I have any barriers or anything?
Uh...
Like...
Holy barriers?
There is the wall behind you.
The rest of the...
The rest of the...
No, no.
I mean...
A spell...
Like a whole...
Like a holy circle or something.
Like...
Or that's not a spell yet.
I have...
You do not have the sanctuary spell.
No.
Okay.
I think...
I think you could have it, but...
Um...
But regardless...
That's...
That spell only takes effect at a...
For a limited amount of time.
Okay.
Just...
Like...
If you've got a skill or you've got an idea about something that you would like to do that isn't related to...
Like...
I'm a paladin and I do magic things...
Then...
Then...
We can totally work with that.
Yeah.
I'm more...
I'm...
I'm just trying to see if I can just...
I was just trying to see if I can just...
I was just trying to see if I can just...
I'm a purple...
Purple...
Protection ward or something like that.
Like...
Well...
You can...
Well...
I'll...
I'll give you this.
You can roll a religion to see if you can put together something that would be...
Um...
Some sort of religious...
Like...
Effectively like...
Doing a circle of salt or something.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So...
Yeah.
Go ahead and roll me a religion for that.
Yeah.
I'm...
15.
All right.
Um...
So...
You identify a few buildings that aren't really...
You know...
Rotted out or...
Or...
Knocked down.
That seemed like they might be defensible locations.
Limited entrances and exits.
And then the walls are still intact.
Okay.
Um...
Along the way.
So...
You...
You're basically able to...
Determine a few of those.
Well...
D20...
Uh...
13.
And my religion is...
One.
And that's 14.
14.
So you fashioned some sort of...
Um...
Some sort of religious symbol that...
That you believe will...
Will protect...
Against...
Uh...
Against evil in...
In the...
Uh...
In the world.
Yeah.
All right.
Anybody else have anything they wanna do?
I know this is kinda...
You know...
It's...
We're at the beginning...
And it's...
And it's...
I'm following this guy.
Uh...
Um...
I wanna see if there's any...
I feel like if there's any...
Place that I'm gonna go...
Uh...
To either...
Give me some insight on...
The treasure maps or anything else that's going on.
Uh...
I wanna kinda...
Kick back to my criminal roots.
Like...
Sure.
Try and get some underground information.
Um...
Sure.
And I feel like that's...
Yeah.
That's gonna be my best.
Okay.
Spot to kinda...
Start off.
All right.
Are there any...
Like...
What's the soundscape like?
Like...
Is there...
Sounds of life...
Or things happening?
Or is it...
Like...
Quiet?
Or...
Lil Jon's playing hip hop.
I'm sorry.
It's time to.
I guess the best thing that I could do to kind of...
Um...
Well...
To kind of help out with...
With...
Um...
The sounds...
The soundscape is...
Imagine the fire swamp...
With...
Waves.
But it's like...
It's that stagnant.
Okay.
But you do hear like...
Groans or...
You know...
Okay.
Things crumbling or...
Okay.
Those sorts of...
So we're on...
We're in full on...
Decrepit zone.
Like...
If you're...
As far...
There's no...
Yeah.
You're pretty certain.
Okay.
Um...
The...
Big thing...
The...
The thing that kind of shocks you about this is because you've been here...
You...
You...
Yeah.
You walk around...
And it was just bustling and loud and...
Yeah.
Right.
Um...
So it's bustling and loud but also like the...
The...
The decrepitness of the buildings...
It seems like they've been...
Derelict for years and years and years and years and years.
Much longer.
So this just seems like really weird...
Um...
Considering that.
All right.
Um...
Are we...
Seen...
Corpses...
As we walk around?
You've not seen a corpse.
No.
You do...
Occasionally...
See...
Um...
Wisps of things...
That...
Maybe your mind's playing trips on you?
Yeah.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Or maybe there's something in the fog that you just can't quite...
It's like right in the corner of your vision.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Turn to...
Turn to Arthur as I kind of make that connection.
I'll say...
To answer your question...
Lots...
Of undead.
There are no bodies.
Or rather...
Not what it could be.
Oh...
And as you guys get closer to the tavern...
Um...
What's the name of the tavern that you're going to anyway?
The Salty Dog.
The Salty Dog.
The Salty Dog.
All right.
As you get closer to the Salty Dog...
Um...
You hear a wet hollow clicking...
That's filling the air.
Almost as if there are claws tapping on stone.
Bone scraping shell.
Um...
And...
And bone scraping against shell.
From the fog...
A dozen shapes emerge.
Their limbs made from fused skeletons and carapace shards.
Ew.
They move in...
They move low and fast.
Glowing blue...
Glowing...
Blue set...
Blue set deep in their skull-like shells.
The bone crabs scuttle closer.
Their bodies glinting with pale coral in the dim light.
Um...
The...
Show you...
See if I can actually click buttons.
Uh huh.
You see...
Hell, nothing.
What in the fuck is that?!
Hell, that...
A...
Uh...
Oh, a hermit crab butt!
That is...
That post facing us down, I think.
That's well and truly disgusting!
A lot of them!
Yes, it's their...
And they're all about the size...
They're all about your size.
truly disgusting a lot of them yes it's there and they're all about the size they're all about your
size oh how many of them are there or do we just hear them and you kind of see one at the front
you see a few emerging from the fog but you you know that there are more there out there
i'm actually need everybody to run down yeah we're on the anchor
yeah all right so it comes away with my battle soft lord initially if you need to the d20
the big one man yep uh uh no that's the g12 i guess we're just staying up
very very close give that a roll so right there just didn't oh oh that kind of you don't get
efficiency to initiate this game do you i don't think well it's just right d20 plus
status it's just an expert d20
so you're going to roll your d20 and then add your dexterity modifier
okay it's okay yeah there is an initiative section down in the combat section at the bottom
that will have your initiative on the right there okay yeah okay
so wait that's the roll roll you probably have an ability that roll your you have a roll 10 minimum
so if you rolled under a 10 on your d20 for your initiative just change that d20 roll to a 10 right
oh it's only when you're rolling initiative though okay so basically i got a 12 then
yep yep um all right so i'm gonna go plus three initiative so all right so dave or actually ramsey
oh what'd you roll uh 15 oh yeah perfect uh taking that 19 that was right there that i just saw
12 12 12. okay uh jason so i think i'm doing like so i take my five and add this right yep the
the modifier okay yeah eight and then i have a plus oh never mind that is it eight all right
i just made a way count i'm like oh dave what'd you get 16
right and ian was 12 right yeah
all right
so let's go ahead and roll out a battle map
all right
so uh ryan and jason this is going to be applicable to both of you if you look on this battle map
there are squares each one of those squares represents five feet if you look at your character
um there's a speed section yep and under land that'll tell you how many feet you can move
so every time so effectively i think you're both at 30 at this point you're probably gonna get more
later on because you're a monk um but that means you can move six squares on on here now everybody uh
we basically generally use just a die that we don't typically that you don't typically use as a
representative of where your character is um you guys are coming in from this direction so i need
everybody to put a character somewhere there i will leave them out in front yeah or oh i'll leave my
drove uh ryan uh typically what is used is a deep one because that doesn't my voice on the star
it makes me some basically yeah i'm basically have them basically just kind of put yourself
whoop i just took myself off the map i'd like to be like like next to you
yeah like i like i got my act of something like a war hammer and right and then these things
you're clear
really might get real quick chris how long rest is different here i remember you saying that
yeah so long rest is 24 hours is 24 hours of downtime okay so it's based so it's basically not 24 hours of
like i'm in a i'm in a city and i'm investigating other things it's like actually 24 hours of relaxation
um i've never gotten a long rest in my entire life
i have on a few weekends um but yeah so that's that's basically what what that is
so is it safe to say we're not long resting in here
it doesn't sound like it it it's unlikely that you will be able to get a long rest in in there yeah
yeah um however um just depending like if you're able to find yourself a place where you can hold
up and there isn't like this super invasion or i don't know you get some way of being able to
find yourself a sanctuary or something you know you can um you can long rest in here
it's just kind of like one of those things where it's like if you remember lord of the rings and when
that when they were in la florian like they need to have a la florian sort of situation
resting in moria but you can long rest in la florian exactly yeah exactly so
okay um all right so um we have
a uh one of the one of the bone crabs is going to be moving up so these things are skittering um and
they appear to have um like the skulls that you saw um on there are more like humanoid skulls less
you know less uh like i think the the picture made it look like it was like an ape skull or something
but these are more like you know humanoid skulls that could be people who were in the ward um that
these that these crabs have picked up
and uh so this one is going to bring her uh no this one's it's this one's turn so this one is gonna
move up five ten fifteen and it's going to attempt to uh it's going to attempt to claw the paladin um so
it basically runs up and its pincers just come together okay it's doing crab hands okay i have
uh my shield is all my shield i should have said this my shield and weapons have been out since i got in
fair enough um
all right so and he's going to do hints with
hints with both of his claws so we go ha does a 13 hit your armor class
yes oh probably shouldn't it seems unlikely okay where is my armor class is down in the combat
section it's at the bottom uh no my base armor class is 600 shield yeah i have 18 wow all right
next one oh shouldn't it cool
a 23 does hit so its second attack hits you
so it pinces you with one claw and you dance out of the way but you dance right into its second claw
as it as it tries to crunch your armor in half dealing five points of damage
which probably a lot yeah if i will too yeah it seems significant
yeah that's like
all right it's our point soon that's like that's my crab
skill we got crabs death by crab hands
uh-huh crab hands okay all right all right
where do i hit i put it in the 10. uh your hit points are
potions for a reason
skirk you are uh you're up well these crabs uh and resource management skirk is man he saw his
friend get hit and he's not he's not having it it's bonus action ragey rage time all right
uh and we're gonna run right the hell up here and he's gonna shout back over his shoulder arthur you
have that one yeah i'm and as he runs up he sort of unhooks this big
basically it's a giant boat anchor hooked to a chain and starts swinging it over his head
all right and that's this top one this front one here
okay
boating like the size of you
he misses it horribly i'm certain what is uh how is uh 11
luck works in that mysterious ways can you get a luck one
wow what ac am i trying to hit here uh the ac that you're looking for is 13. oh it was so
close okay then you could spend luck again sorry i'm trying to remember
both can i see a because you want to get plus one or you can spend see what a book i just need a reminder
so you can use a luck point to add a plus one to your roll yeah um you can spend three luck points
to get a re-roll um
and i think that's it all right okay yep i am recklessly attacking okay so yeah you are yeah
what are you doing together what do you get
same thing okay i mean it's your first swing of the game
warming up yeah yeah yeah that's okay i'm still doing what i need to be doing
i'm taking the hits yeah well no that's absolutely you're in this spot but yeah exactly
all right and i reached i have resistance dollar exactly
all right so now we're looking at zander um question yes is flanking a thing yes okay all right
so for everybody else that means that you're standing directly across from an enemy or someone
worm you get your boxes here yep yep get a plus two here okay so what zander's gonna do
is i'm gonna move uh diagonals work the way they do in five i assume oh i'm just going by the five
foot rule so okay just make it simple yeah all right so i'm gonna move five ten fifteen so i get
into a flanking position with uh arthur there yep um but i am going to
temporarily kind of turn myself towards this one here um i've got to pull out my shield um
and as i as i cast the spell um for the verbal component um zander will say in about this tone
by the will of moraine and the the shield the waves on it kind of animate and start to like froth
almost like they're boiling in a jet of steam uh like boiling hot water comes out of the shield
and aims towards that one as i cast firebolt all right like how water theme firebolt work
so wait no how does this one do no not bad 17 or no beggar uh 20 uh no 19 that's how math works 19
that's it 19 hits 13 yeah yeah indeed indeed all right man he will suffer
uh 10 points of damage fire damage despite the water
all right
uh yeah so your your blast you know hits him hits him really hard and uh his his carapace starts
to turn a little bit of a reddish hue um and then is bone crabs turn the monsters get luck points
hopefully not
uh they do not i get doom i like some of that doom will allow me to make things a little bit harder
for you or a little bit easier for me uh-huh um but um i'm not gonna use it right now yeah every
yeah oh i was just curious yeah they yeah the the gm gets a luck point thing but it doesn't work the
exact same way yeah it's aggravated keeping track of what points on richard oh yeah i figured it would
be some sort of ag um so this guy is going to move yeah that makes sense that makes sense and
as if the crab is smart enough to do that but it's just getting in a better position um it's but
yeah so it's going to attempt to uh it'll fuck me up it's gonna attempt to hit you
i mean that's 100 what will happen yeah nope it has advantage because i recklessly attacked
oh wow okay it's still win this uh a
15 15 15 misses okay very nice and it's second
uh i see an 18 there that's gonna be bad for me yeah it is it is a 20 uh 20 hits
um so it's going to do so again it's kind of like one of those things where like it kind of grabs
at your legs you dance out of the way it has that it's always just that's another one that you're not
used to do how do you deal with so many so many heads you know claws as the case may be
um and it does um 10 points of damage oh well good thing that's halved yeah yeah so i have damage
because i'm raging i have damage resistance to basically all physical damage which i'm assuming
what these things are that is what it is so skirt kind of takes like the thing probably grabs onto
his arm and skirt kind of shakes it off like get out of here ben takes five points of damage where
the hell is that on this right there nope all right there that was a lie right there all right all right
okay so next up we've got arthur so just you know i didn't take any time to tell dave and ramsey how to
play because they know how to play um but for the rest of you this will be useful for you in combat
you have a move action a regular action in the bonus section and you can use all of them but you can't
use a bonus action for you have to have a natural bonus action ability in order to be able to use that
bonus action um the regular action can be an ability that you have or it can be an attack um that that's
generally how that's how that's um you some of some of your abilities give you the ability some of your
stuff outside of those actions yeah i was looking at guard and we're seeing how that worked um
um guard is a bonus action yeah i figured so and obviously you can use guard for sure um and what
guard does is it basically gives the guy who who you're attacking it gives them disadvantage to attack
you or anybody who's within five feet of you okay and it's a bonus action so you can use it every single
turn um as a paladin um as a paladin so that's that's pretty cool okay disadvantage actually gives a
paladin a bonus action yeah yeah but it was pretty safe okay divine smite a buddhist action divine smite
is something that you can do on the hit so like honestly yeah okay okay so that means that if i hit i can
you can use divine smite okay um but divine but you have a limited amount of dawn you have a limited
amount of smites you can only do as many smites as you have spell slot which at this point is okay so
be careful a lot of this game is about resource management so you don't want to blow your wad in
the first combat okay when it's against okay okay yeah yeah it's just too stupid my attention to that
work okay my bonus action is going to be guarding that guy who attacked me okay but what's your
regular action going my regular action i am simply going to swing my hammer and my war hammer down
around him all right yeah so what you're going to do is you're going to look at your uh weapon in your
weapons section where you should have a bonus area bonus is plus six okay so you need to roll d20
and add plus six to it and that is your attack roll it's pointing give advantage it does it's it's
so you'll get oh so it's not plus one it's it's advantage oh or two plus two is it plus two or is it
advantage because yeah it's yes what what is it in 5e is it advantage or is it a plus two it's an optional
one but it's advantage yeah because everything's advantage in 5e yeah dude i think i messed up
pathfinder and that's what i guess yes so yeah so it's advantage so you roll two i don't do two and
take the higher one sorry you're good you're good fine yeah i mess up your thing no i didn't i didn't have
any no okay you're good okay i mean technically you gave i think you i think 15 i don't think so
because this one hit on 20 right yeah yeah yeah 15 15 you pass me the book
okay um okay no wait 14 14 does hit yes yeah i guess i look at it i forget wait no wait they're
right next to each other on this dice so you know it was a 15 as this my team still hits yeah so roll
damage your damage is on your is on your character sheet and it's 1d8 okay so roll a d8 and then add four to it
eight eight all right and that was blunt damage i believe
yeah bludgeoning but yeah same thing um all right now we are up to
little john all right so how does how does a longbow work if it's got a range of 150 feet
it means that anything that you've got line of sight on which is like basically everything yeah you
probably don't have line of sight on that guy from where you're obviously because there's a building
yeah but anything that it's reasonable for your character to have seen you can shoot
okay um i mean if i have 20 arrows am i losing an arrow every time i shoot one or am i collecting that
back or well i'm not going to keep you know we don't care technically yes but i don't do track
about me don't do that so i can i can just stay where i'm at and shoot this thing absolutely
seems like a great idea as a matter of fact that is what i would recommend you um
okay so how do i do this so which yes which ones like uh yeah so pick your target so which guy do you
want to hit so we want to hit i think we want to hit this guy because these this guy has got two
different attackers right yeah yeah i want to take this guy off his i appreciate that okay all right so
that's your target so what you're going to need to do is grab it is that two four one two three uh
no because each of these are only five feet and if you have a range of 150 feet yeah you can shoot
yeah you can shoot like two or three different you got one of your right okay so you're fine so take a d20
which is that guy and give it a roll and oh well we got it too
so what we what you would do is you then add your longbow attack modifier you should have a plus
something next to it yeah so that would be a seven to hit which does not hit but if you did hit
you would go to the damage section and you would roll that's one d8 um and then you would add your
dexterity modifier which is plus three um to your to your damage okay um plus you have this mystic
mark ability which is really cool where you should totally use that when you can well but you get a
luck but you do get lucky yes okay and i'm far away from this please yes right they're not murdering
you yeah that sounds you're screwed that's fine that's fine i get i can be mad these guys can hit
on me for a while i got healing potions okay uh and then one other question uh so is my minute that's
kind of unless low light vision of any use in this thing uh well the low light vision will allow you
to kind of see in harder to harder to see areas so the effectively like it like you're in this misty
area so tip it so typically you would have disadvantage on like seeing in distances and that kind of thing
but because you're an elf like you are able to see through mist and low light vision as well like
it's kind of a the elf the elf's low light vision is like super low by vision it's kind of cool
so you shoot you miss um and then we move on to a bone crab this guy he's gonna go
and he's going to attempt to attack the boiling marauder there you've got quite the conga line going
there you're right yeah
wow um does an 11 hit negative all right attack number two
oh that's gonna happen uh 21 oh yeah oh yeah
all right and that's eight points of damage oh no
drop roll
all right next up we have um miran or no not miran what mr mr that's the name i'm looking for
um
okay yeah
it's from a tactics perspective here um in in dnd and other rpgs it's always a good idea
um in dnd especially there's like this concept of like
um
action economy where the more actions one side has the more likely it is they're going to win
um just in general so typically you want to take somebody out um before uh before moving on to
another target in general um unless you're unless you're going up against a bunch of minions where
it's like you're one-shotting all of them but if you spread your damage out a lot then it's more
likely that your group is going to get hammered really hard um because they because they get
more attacks against you so all right that's just something to consider
go for it so i mean i know i know it's a different game different character but
i haven't shied away from uh
uh just going straight in for the no absolutely for the big blow right away so
uh
so you said i can move attack and do a bone attack bonus action okay so
i i kind of have the same idea as what little john had okay i want to come up here and help
business all right so we got another we got two conga lines happening yep
uh-huh um and this crowd class lightning bolt i quit
can you pack him up rolling all those um there ain't enough healing
uh i'm gonna take my my quarter step okay uh and take a crack at that guy all right um to try
and help out my teammate there uh what is my quarter step
um so that will be a d20 that you roll plus your uh okay so that's your bonus for your four
staff which should be from alien images d6 which is no you you you roll the d20 then you just add six
to it oh all right yep because you roll the d20s you go because you're flanking so i got
yeah they're just like you you also have advantage i would recommend that you rolled again just in
case because if you roll a 20 you crit which okay does double damage yep okay or does because yeah
doubles your dice i should say but still lots of damage
all right so 14 plus plus six will hit a ac of 13 so you hit okay um now you take the damage value the
damage value of your um quarter staff oh i'm sorry i so my bonus for the quarter staff is five
not six okay which is you still hit okay so no good on that okay and then my damage it says one d6 plus
three yep right six is just the regular i'll get these numbers down eventually yeah four
so a seven yep okay so you do seven points of damage
all right all right and you do have a bonus action that you can use and as a monk i'm pretty sure
you've got do more damage bonus so i think you are or actually let me do you mind if i check
let's see what because i know you've got bonus actions you you should probably use those um oh
oh well what what did you roll it was a seven total right there's a two and then the plus five yeah okay
well you weren't you weren't able to do that but um next time i mean it would have made a difference
you could totally have done it but next time aim doubles your proficiency bonus when you're on your
first attack yeah so that would take your uh plus two so your proficiency bonus is here so plus two
which is how you get that plus five so that would turn so if you aimed and then shot you get a plus seven
rather than a plus five so use your bonus action next time to do that i if we um
if we were in a situation where it would have made a difference i totally would have allowed you to
have been like oh yeah that's totally why i use my bonus action on and i do damage but um unfortunately
he just didn't roll high enough to be able to be able to do that but that'll be really useful in the
future all right so um jason the thing that i'm thinking about specifically is flurry of blows
i'm pretty sure that as a monk at second level you have flurry of blows right
yeah i think if you're if you're doing an armed attack i think is how oh that's why i'm looking in there
sorry i don't have my whole sheet filled out oh it's okay so we need to go to 60
where's my i know the charts on here
or is that not the that's not the charts i've been eating uh i would just basically kind of take a look
at um sorry i'm just no you're fine i'm just taking over here um so you've got
um
mux of glass unarmored movements
flurry of blows here we go oh immediately after you use an action on your turn you can spend one
technique point from which you have a pool of technique points you can spend one pet technique
point to make two unarmored strikes um or make an attack roll with with a monk weapon as a bonus
action oh nice so spend a bonus action and technique point to make another attack
yeah so you can either you can either do that with your with your staff or you can
just punch him twice too so either way
all right um be useful
what was the damage that i did to him with the quarter step on the first one
it was a deep six yep so you did seven damage total seven uh
uh just curious i don't know how much it's probably a d6 but i don't know uh level two
your martial arts is a d4 so really at this point you have two choices one you can make two attacks
and do a d4 potentially with both of them or make one attack with a d6
if you do the two attacks you get to add your dexterity bonus twice so all right i was going to
say the four sounds like my better yeah yeah yeah because monks be awesome all right so yeah we're
going to do the the unarmored or unarmed so and the one you in the way that you can flavor it like
unarmed unarmed attacks aren't just punches so you could hit them with the staff and then do like a
double kick or something oh all right i got you just definitely oh you have to roll your d22 oh
that's right yep because you just have to hit with your sack but you have advantage so roll it twice
yep and take the highest
six
did i seriously roll six again there's one that no that's a nine okay nine plus five
uh yes okay that's a hit okay and then i roll the four and then you add your dexterity
that's 30 to it so how am i i have to i read this thing so the top the one on the top is the number
you want okay this is a very good question never mind okay i didn't realize yeah it's like oh yep very
good question we're learning we're learning it's a it's a three plus your dexterity which is another
three so that um that's six and then do another attack because you're doing it oh yeah yeah so so
roll the d20 again okay just automatically my advantage and again you have advantage still so
so you can take the sixes there's the six right we're looking for 13. all right so that's another
another uh another d4 so you can pick it up right and then add your dexterity to whatever it is yep i got
a one uh so that gives me a four yep with my dexterity so you did
quite a bit of damage sweet yeah whack whack whack whack whack uh you you like hit it with your staff and
then spin around and do a double kick on it and knock it to the ground it shapes itself off but it is
not looking um it's looking pretty uh pretty biffed at this point so
really
nope the best you can the best you can do is uh get a uh
uh well you just did seven plus six is 13 plus four is 17. yeah
still then oh
actually
yes
that was uh yes you did actually
yeah you did actually take care of it sorry i missed i laughed yes i misnumbered the thing
um
oh yeah so
okay so then if that one died at a certain threshold does that mean the other ones have the same health
most likely that's a good assumption not necessarily not always in this case it's probably a good
no no the only problem if you're going to hit hit hit is now half healthy because everyone
eat a little low under a half health because it's basically
why solve the ability on this guy if the 200 front yes
there's invisible yeah um
um yes there i i think that there's something for allies it's okay but like it's poor enemies
they provide cover for each other kind of way no which makes their
it's disadvantage for cover or is it negatives to hit it i don't remember yeah it's probably
yeah and fyi chris i don't know if you know this you had two of them up in the initiative order
before me and you removed both of them oh there was one so i don't know if that was you're right
so the one that the one died so that one is done this one is this one is i don't know which one
that is but that one was this one so this guy is starting to uh he's going to continue to attack
the paladin yeah and i also get also he has the he has an e-boss that gets guarded oh yeah so he's at
disadvantage on his attacks how does guard work yeah let's see what he's just going to do it
it's sorry i can't oh no you're good i just want to be your shield or intercept uh it's like an
enemy at five feet that creature has disadvantage on the first attack roll it makes against you or
any ally within five feet of you so it doesn't have because the ally has to be within five feet of
well yeah but he's guarding himself so it's oh okay i thought he was i thought he was guarding
no ramsey oh i bet okay yeah guard action just yeah i got it it's like a five foot burst yep i
understand now i just mean i don't understand how words work i get it all right uh so the first
attack misses terribly the second attack that's a hit that's gone wait wait i thought it's
somebody to need the second attack oh never mind guard is only on the first attack i'm pretty sure yeah
yeah first attack i think so it does eight points of damage to you
okay i know what i'm doing in my next turn
all right um start uh yeah we're gonna do the dumb thing and make sure this guy doesn't engage with
anybody else uh huh and we're gonna recently attack here the whole roll with thing yup
uh no it was seven plus a six is a 13 that's your hit yeah but you might not rip you do that good
that's true roll for that crit yeah do the crit fishing i did not crit d8 one of these days
yeah plus four is 11 plus two from rage is 13 points of smashing damages the
ankles came crashing down on the top of the thing's skull it was just a warm-up swing that's right
that's right okay um
he's looking pretty hard
he definitely like it gravels back up but uh it's not
um second attack oh
wait a minute
i had to try jim um all right um and what am i no we don't need a healing potion yet
you have a bonus action that you want to spend uh bonus action i could be the healing potion i don't
need to rage because i'm already raised i don't nope i don't think so okay i don't think i have
anything else to do with my bonus action at the moment so i think we're good yeah i wasn't sure if
the barbarian had some random bonus action thing that i'm sure it does i just not yet
all right um so we're looking at uh xander xander oh boy uh so i hit the one behind me and
and you have hit the one between us the more i hit it is basically i should be like we're half
colors oh yeah advantage for attacking those what i'm going to do is i'm going to turn to this one
my clover i don't know okay you don't have you don't have to tell me
raise the shield again uh
i'll come to see you reclaim you um and i will cast sacred flame this time because it is not a ranged
attack um and the the shield again the waves kind of animate uh and kind of lash out from
the shield at it um it needs to make a duck sitting thrilled
yes
19. 19. uh well that's gonna succeed i likely still do half damage but i'm checking
what's up with my guys they usually roll terribly hit new ones
i'd like them terribly please say no no damage on a pound uh six out i'm good
sick
do you have bonus action to spend oh i do not
okay all right technically do is what i'm not casting supposed
all right uh so this one is going to be attacking
um this this guy
oh actually i lied sorry rewind just a moment i do in fact have a bonus action
okay plug ah yeah that's smart take more my healing potion that's smart
uh 24 plus two
uh four five six seven eight nine ten all right i'll go to full a little over
that's all right all right raised to two hit two hit points better be alive than not yep
all right uh so
this one is it it basically takes its it takes its claw and you see a uh almost like a
almost like a thorn in the at the tip of its claw and it attempts to dab it oh let's spell it like that
oh you're gonna get poison uh like that at all well on the bright side yeah uh does a 12 hit no then
it misses sick there you go good dice good dice these are what the dice usually do i approve
all right ian you're up okay
okay lay on hands is that like a long rest or a short rest
uh it's a long rest refresh okay i still have 10 of those so that's those 10 hit points okay what's
oh two
so you have 10 hit points that you can restore to yourself or somebody else
10 hit points okay okay um
ian but ian keep in mind as long as these things are alive okay yeah you're gonna continue to take
damage okay yes oh well your priority number one no that should be to kill things as quickly as
possible and crabs do no damage and then after that you can worry about healing because all your healing
stuff is a bonus action anyway okay so okay so don't get stuck in analysis paralysis about what
you're gonna do for healing yeah hit it first up is it still the dnd thing or the most efficient way to
heal once somebody falls down actually i'm i'm assuming unfortunately yeah yeah yeah okay then i would guard
again that's why we took healing word are you going to hit it yes yeah i'm going to hit it what
stop worrying about your bonus action worry about your action okay yes then then we'll worry about your
bonus action yeah yeah yeah i'll do my warfare again and smash me down on him again
okay so it's a lot of meat roll two d20 because you have advantage
also they're undead so for each one so good uh yeah they have their skulls riding friends
very good um does does a uh 24 hits 24 does hits so roll that down did you roll a 20 no i did not
i wore 20 i wore 18. all right roll damage that's your hand that's uh that's
this
seven all right yes seven points of damage
and that's when you've been whaling them yeah that's what i've been whaling up all right
um yeah how do you want to have killed it i basically basically i basically do i basically
i basically i jump and it's not as crushed the skull on his back all right
soft innards see that all right
great job boys now are you going to use your bonus action to heal or are you going to use your
bonus action to guard um i'm going to use my bonus action and throw uh for uh take a take a potion
okay so roll two d4 and then add a plus two to it okay i'm going to move on and you can move if you
would like i guess i'm certainly can okay let me let me okay who is in the most danger right now
i'm i that's that's probably not the other cleric okay then i'm going to help the cleric out
i mean given given the choices like i don't know yeah i mean you probably can't reach
i have 30 i have 30 i have 30. yeah so if you go 5 10 15 20 25 30. i mean either way is um
i don't think anyone's in super danger no no no okay so but you could basically just make it to
either one of them and then throw up your guard and give whoever gets attacked next to you like
uh disadvantage on the attack or you can cough that potion either one is a good option
but at least move up because you'll get closer to yeah
i'm moving somewhere yeah i'm gonna be moving up to the up to this guy to this guy yeah like here
yeah okay you gonna drink the potion or guard i'm i'm definitely i'm at tape hits so would you like
to be here instead
yes i mean you could be here at advantage um guard is still oh i guess guard does not apply
yeah so maybe they do guard here yeah affect you this guard will work for him yeah oh because
it's only oh yeah yeah five foot okay yeah yeah yeah so but if you're gonna if you're not gonna be
using garden if you're gonna be joking down a potion then that's probably the right place to be
so are you with a potion or are you going to be using guarded
it was like i feel like i'm going to die i said that this thing attacks me
why how many points do you have eight you're fine you're fine okay then i'll
then i'll move up here and guard only if it rolls really really well are you gonna die
it's unlikely that it's going to attack you anyway because i just hit it with a big thing
that is also true yeah yeah pretty big but also to clarify
in this game you don't die yeah you hit zero you just go unconscious yep
hitting zero being passed out it's just like it's the rate of passage for adventure yeah
so little john you're up all right
dials one yep two three
okay uh are you what which uh which guy are you aiming at um i'm gonna go for
yeah that guy literally took the old hit yeah see if we can take him out that's nice buddy all right and
that is that you want to see right yeah yep yep well that we got oh it's pretty good mine is a 13.
yep all right 13 so 13 plus 70.
that's a hit so now you look at your damage and it's 1d10 or 1d8 sorry uh piercing that's what that
is plus your dexterity so roll a d10 which is d8 or sorry d8 i'm i'm stuck on the that's a d8
all this roll that and then add your dexterity modifier which is three to that so good yeah i like
hearing those dice uh so that's three yeah so that's points damage
right
oh oh oh also oh use your mystic mark um now your mystic market is is a limited resource but
it's i i think it's like especially in the first combat where you're still figuring out your character
it's a really good thing to use so when you hit a guy you can activate your mystic mark and your
mystic mark will do additional damage every every hit that you do from for i think it's like a minute
or 10 minutes or something um it only works on one one guy but when you kill that or when that guy dies
you can transfer to somebody else and it adds a d4 to your uh your to hit so it's the triangle
die which is a d4 oh my god ah sneaky oh and yours you read backwards you have the number on the bottom
yeah you beat the number on the bottom which was a four um well no okay i'm gonna this guy i got
no idea yeah that one is when you're looking at this um there are two not deleted so um
so you roll your your it was six plus four damage that you did yep so that's ten total damage
that should get him i think most important thing about d4s you don't stop on them yet
how do you want to yeah i got a shot right to the head just it's like a like a laser through the
brain hey my it just bow turning skills yeah love to see it all right and you can distracted and
angry from is there another person you whacked him a few times but i got a clean shot off nice
having a lot of disgruntled because my previous shot missed or went into the wall might as well
shot this guy all right excellent thanks thanks ryan this thing is just out here yeah so like if you
roll low and you want to go higher you can add that to it okay you have some tracks so if i use that
uh uh so you can use your mystic mark your proficiency bonus plus one per per long rest so um
forget the i i'll i'll look it up for you like basically you you have it's a limited resource so you
have to be kind of careful on how often you use it but especially in this first combat i think it's
important that you pull all your levers so you know what you're looking at yeah just the deck when
when it says dex dex was right so yeah so you've got your dex score which is that 16 but it's modifier is
the plus three but don't okay um usually when it references a dex thing it's referencing a modifier not
here almost always there are only a few exceptions when it's none okay all right cool so jason
wait over there can you grab me my zero i have a zero question right the the little oval
it looks like a statue type thing it is am i able to move across that the same way that i am
um does that make sense like to head over uh so with that um you would it would be it was like
difficult terrain to be able to get to be able to move through that okay um so if you've got i think
no that's so that's low john little john has the ability to move through difficult terrain and and
not be limited by it but i'm not sure or
actually i might not have to right because i can go 30. well also depends on where you're
like if you're going through here this is normal but if you're going through here that's where it's
oh gotcha yeah i'm trying to cut over to kind of come help uh xander okay so like
5 10 15 20 25 right because then that would give us yep the flank absolutely okay yes that was that's
what i was mentally trying to figure out there yep um okay so that's my move and then i think i'm
sticking with the same attack that i went with the last time i'm going to swing at him with the
quarterstaff and hopefully kind of yep uh so then i'm going to do so i do the d the 20 right and roll
it twice because you haven't managed already hit but you might correct oh i'm still there yep okay
and that was
the d6 right yes which is a regular one yep this
this this to this town which is a three plus your plus my three yep yeah it's just so i got a six
okay so like this is this is jason so we've got a bad guy yeah so okay so you can kind of see where
you're at or if you're coming up uh how much uh six was my 16 was my damage
that's exactly the type of thinking we love to see well he's got his like jumbo
doubler thing that he wails at yep well that the other two players are playing
and meanwhile you're just sitting there okay so i got a 17 that has like a long-range weapon
um i've got range i technically have javelins but i will almost never be using them you are a long-range
weapon you didn't tossing me what was my unarmed attack bonus it just looks like a spike chain
it's not a spike in the middle right one one player die and the other player's potion can someone hand
the other person a potion yeah yeah we have to oh right on we have to be close on the way to do that
yeah yeah there are more people who've failed rules oh i did not i have only failed one rule but i
have my luck point i forced me yeah i think i think i failed us i think i found i think i
failed i'm pretty sure that you said all the rules yeah i don't know if his i don't know if his
save that failed
yeah yeah yeah yeah because i forced them to make the roll they passed oh yeah no i'm sorry yeah i
that that that did have a that did have a your luck point has been revoked sorry
trying to give people no worries and then i add my my dexter or my dex so then i don't know that's a four
or damage on that one yeah that's the damn never mind i'm thinking uh yeah for the hit for the hit or miss
numbers and don't think your sniper your sniper was like oh yeah all right he was doing a billion
points of damage and if you're attacking again you gotta roll it yeah yeah he was a he was a shower
on character that was built for combat he does a billion points of damage you're not getting i was
i was literally rolling every dice that i had every single time i tapped out he was rolling my 15 dice
sevens plus no i stick with just the seven right but yours plus your your attack whatever your attack
bonus is so oh plus the five yeah so that's a 12. that's a 12 which will not hit but you can spend a
luck weight to make it a 13 which will hit which he's uh that crab's already been yeah oh yeah he is
probably pretty heavily okay all right i'll still yeah absolutely i'll spend a luck point for that yep
absolutely when you spend the point they just rotate to the next person left room
oh that's it oh that's how that works okay do i re-roll the 20 then no no no you just
okay but that is a hit so now i can spend a luck point that turns into a 13.
so i got a two so which gives me a five for damage that's right um how do you want to feel
uh we're gonna go with a with a little uh jab uppercut combo and we took him out on that one okay so
you jab it and then you do an uppercut and the uh and the cobalt size crab basically lifts up in the air
and topple and topple and topples onto the ground um and it's not moving he did right on right now right
and there were one
nope all right so we got this guy he's going to
double attack is a barbarian mm-hmm and they offer this wait wait because this is
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait i like waiting this is the wizard crab
here comes the lightning bolt
all right so um as that crab starts
uh-huh uh-huh um it there there are some tendrils that come out
uh-huh and grab it and oh oh hold back in
uh-oh again uh-oh
after two seconds you hear some crunching and some
oh and some gnawing i wasn't saving it it was it was nominated it was lunch and then
oh you see guys okay
you see a creature oh it's a frog with pentacles um
come out of the fog yeah that's oh that's gross yeah symbols of frog at best yeah it has
it has it has six eyes set into its
bulbous um it's bulbous body that has a giant mouth as it comes forward it's crunching and munching
on the on the on the bone crab um
um and it has uh and it has entered into the fray are the are his tentacles
just grabby or do they do anything else uh they are currently
waiting around yeah gesticulating wildly yeah but we don't know if they just don't care
yeah i don't like this or anything like that right oh
just to make things a little bit easier
give you guys a little bit more space yeah yeah
a little more playroom a little bit more play all right
and now we're starting the combat round with
um skirk uh yeah i think the only thing to do when a giant cthulhu frog
okay like it it pulled it in and i was yeah
you're good you're good
uh well you know i'm gonna have to move up here then okay
and i think the only appropriate thing to do when you see a giant tentacle frog
eat a crab that you were intent on killing
is to kill the frog that killed the crab you just gotta divert that energy yeah
you uh uh the frog is smooshier than the crab it'll be easier to kill oh it doesn't have crab shell
i mean that's right okay no
and we're gonna recklessly attack yeah
for usual i can't use this to turn it to a 20 is that correct correct
it's okay i'll just roll a 20 here yeah yeah i did not uh but a 25 better hit or what
25 hits in ac of 12. ah okay well interesting all right and then d8
uh one plus four is five plus two is seven points of damage as i said i kind of cracked this thing in
the eye in one of its like 12 eyes with all right um when you when you swing your when you swing
swing your flail down to to hit it and hit it in the eye it closes it's on it and the flail like hits yeah
bounces off yeah um you still do you have seven points of damage um but this guy apparently is
tough all right
all right we're not as first where we go yep oh i have a bonus action oh yeah we don't have a bonus
action yet i'm good no hmm xander um
it's probably time
yes that seems like the most effective thing to do
that's weird um
that's great um
uh xander is going to make sure
oh i think
it's fair warning guys like um
these combat this combat is as you guys get more
familiar with
they will go faster oh yes um but
as uh as people get familiar with their new characters these things always take a long time
yeah thanks a little bit on board
so yeah it's not going to be there
20
20
20
25
5 10 50 20 25 perfect that looks good to me uh xander's gonna kind of
walk around to hear uh think about what's about to happen and uh he's going to raise his shield
um and say uh as the sea gives its bounty so shall we and i he kind of raises it above his head
the rose and white uh white with light um and as it does so uh
uh it kind of shoots out and then almost like a misty rain uh falls upon skirk uh and uh
arthur thank you and on a little john back here and you are all blessed
oh
oh
so what this means is for the rest of the combat i'm going to say every time you roll the die did you add
a d4 to that because every time you make a d20 roll you get to add a d4 to it as well
all right you roll d20 and d4 at the same time add them together and then add your ability modifier
okay sick which is nice it's very good very good all right which for those statistic nerds of you
is a plus five to plus twenty percent to hit all right now it's it's turn unless you have fun
that nope
get that close to it
second fault it's fine
2025 yeah that's fine we'll be we'll be there that's a little better
understood
right um well
yeah yeah so
going to it's going to attempt to have a
have a kobold snack i have a reaction okay yeah i have a reaction i am fierce
okay when a creature that is large size or bigger makes an attack against me i can make an attack
against it oh very cool wow yeah actually awesome all right a bold feature
uh the thing i'm recklessly attacking
well i'm adding a d4 yep that will not help when you roll a one
11 plus yeah i was at a 12 earlier so yeah yeah excellent is that all the time or a limited number
per per per all the time
yes holy crap this yeah that's a that's a good one
yeah that's a good feature of a white bar
uh six plus four is ten plus two is twelve points of damage as it reaches like it
how is it attacking me i guess yeah it's trying to it's trying to bite you okay i uh
swing the flail and crack it against it still like while its mouth is open i smack its tongue
um well it's gonna it still makes the attack yeah it's going to get foggers to punch it crunch
uh it's a 14 14 misses
you really stung its tongue yeah yeah that was going so it was not awesome it was going to be
that was going to be great um okay all right and that is its turn um but you take those turns more
often
next up is yeah okay uh okay i'm going to be following where my javelin sat
you need to make sure that that's is it all the time
but you're not able to be sure it's not going to be fine
so go ahead and roll your d20
you can see within five feet of you use your reaction to the attack to attack the creature
immediately after its attack okay so the reaction happens after the attack well that's okay but
other than that i read it correctly okay oh wait okay so
yeah i'm always the last guy i learned to shoot him so he'll
it was a six and i had and i think had six so it was
i got 12.
i don't know if you got us two if you get in 12.
yeah yeah if you if you got it 12 or better you hit so go ahead and your bench okay so that's
it's a decent well you don't run up you just kind of i love a javelin and fling it
it's going to play it that's the thing
oh man it is back in season six games oh is it terrible it's cranberry order i love it
oh oh it's horrible
yeah so you fling the javelin and it just sticks right where right in between its eye right in
between its eyes and it's just like right up there nice shot yes all right is that weak smart now
if you get something no no that's not how this game works ah oh
yeah and yeah and your bonus action is not going to be any good at this point yes well i am going
to i am just going to take a potion how many pot you've already drank one potion no i guard oh you're
right nope drink a potion yeah and two you know i was just concerned that you were going through your
potions mighty fast no no no no no that's a little so go do these two of the troubles plus two like
i don't want to have one of these so let's roll this roll all right so ryan
uh yeah so your mystic mark you can basically use um as
more creature to add it for a minute yeah um i'm trying to give me one second because
you're missing marking me pops the bonus section to move it no but
the creature you can miss your mark in your favorite quarry which will change the mark to
1 million until you use this piece to mark different creatures in case it becomes fascinated
you're the next 54 you can use this feature to your proficiency bonus regain i don't know
re-press doesn't nope just as when you hit a creature with an attack roll you can mystically mark it
there's no rule for moving it
so it's just he hits when he hits the creature again he whatever creature he hits he just automatically marks it
but until you use this feature to mopping the creature or until you
but it is only a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus on a long rest
yeah
i for sure thought that there was um there was a move it
thing they're playing on that scene yeah i don't see anybody um well
still aim and shoot um all right yep
learn a new thing every day that was a
20. wait also i believe i believe y'all suit for you never mind and then i've got the
plus um five three and two so right yeah it's a plus five yeah plus city four yeah yeah so you're
you're not gonna you've got the 14 you've got the d4 and add that to it the d4 yeah
all right
so one so you add that to that so it's a 15
then because you aimed you get um you get double your proficiency bonus to your hit so instead of a
five your proficiency bonus is a two so it would bump it up to a seven so you've got 15 plus seven
that's a 22 to hit okay which will hit yep and at that point you're rolling a d8
don't worry it's just d20 and add a number it's a simple game all right
one one and then you add your dexterity modifier to that so that's four four points of damage
so which doesn't it was misses right no no you the 22 made you hit and you just did four points
of damage too yep so you're the first thing for that is just you just want to over yeah yeah
yep the first one is a target threshold it's going to
correct this is the second rule is your damage yeah and the main reason why i had you go through
the whole thing is just so you can work it out in the future you know so you know the reason behind
the number is we're not just like oh yeah that's just you know you've killed it no problems did
so not not super helpful so all right so you fire on this guy um and you pepper it with an arrow
okay
move on okay um that is
mistrol's turn okay i am putting my quarterstaff away okay and but i'm gonna come up
and the your side of this guy chris it doesn't matter where right
25 um and i'm gonna instead of the quarterstaff i'm gonna take some uh swing at him with my short
swords okay yeah um
um i wanna i wanna try and take out some of those tentacles yeah seems pretty solid
yeah
and you do have advantage on this roll so roll it again let's see if you roll it
20 yep nope but they were both good goals yeah yeah so the 19 just just again to kind of figure
figure everything out you take your 19 and you add your bonus to hit which is your proficiency bonus
which at this level is a two yep and then you add your dexterity to it because you're using a finesse
weapon okay so let's see what was it 19 21 excuse me 24 okay and is he rolling a d4 that's not
so you've got a 24 to hit which does meet or beat the 12 the 12 uh armor class okay so you hit him
with your uh short sword yep now you take the damage value of the short sword which is d6 yep roll that
and then add your dexterity to it so two so i got us live five damage yep all right and that's your uh
that's your action now if we want to use your bonus action to he's still alive oh yeah this guy's a big
boy uh-huh it was the boss what's called uh the boots um this is the elite monster yes
so i i don't have to do the unarmed no i can do another like i could swing again with my short sword
uh the minute if i wanted to if you have an ability that allows you to use a bonus action to
make an attack with a monk weapon yes
i don't remember tales of value has that so
home okay so then i'm gonna take a couple kicks at him as well then i'll just i'll just
stick with the double okay well something to keep in mind with the with the flurry blows is each time
you use it you use a key point so oh that's right you need to keep track of how many key points you're
spending okay i'm not saying don't do it i'm just want to make sure that i really wasn't
um you're not just blowing your wad and on your first yeah right
can the boss only attack one of us at a time yes this turn yeah
is
chris decides the combat isn't hard enough
depending on the monster some some of the monsters do more
this one only made one attack on its turn
you might not be you might not have a bonus action to spend if you don't use your if you
don't use your month points which or your key points which is fine or technique points is what
i think that's what they're called here yeah
but i mean like i mean dave hasn't been using any of his bonus actions and it's personally it's
perfect you just wanted to start to start raging and that's it yeah yep okay so it's not a no it's
not a oftentimes won't have a thing to do with a bonus okay yeah that's why it's called the bonus
action yeah it's actually kind of it's actually really interesting that a lot of classes have
things to do they both do with their bonus actions at this level like the paladin usually doesn't have
anything yeah the ranger doesn't usually have anything except for his hunter's mark which is
basically it's mystic mark yeah you so yeah yeah as a monk you can always make one of an strike
as a bonus action without spending pills okay it's just like you spend the point and you get
an act one or one weapon oh good thank you thank you thank you okay so you can you know so you can
5e you can always get one for the bonus yeah so you can't you can't use your you can't use your
short swords but you can attack it with an unarm strike
all right let's try and hit him with a good uh roundhouse kick so that's kick to the face
yeah so i'm doing the d20 right will it twice oh there you go 20 there you go you for it that's
how it's done all right so what a critical does here is you double the damage dice that you roll for
your attack okay and this and that's the one that i can never pick up yeah um but all damage dice so
like if you've got like special abilities that add more dice or you've like you've got like like for
example if ryan would have crit and he was using his mystic mark he would be willing to d8 and 2d4
and that kind of gotcha okay though the more dice you have the better critical crit is okay
nope i mean but still rolling two dice instead of one is still decided twice as good
and i got a two and roll it again roll it again add it again
i just need to get a little bit of a little bit of internet how does that just cut them too yeah
all right next year four you still had your own dexterity which is three so i got a seven damage yep
that's a pretty good kick yeah yeah considering you had d4 and you pretty much did max damage for that
so you've run it with your short sword you lob off a uh you lob off the tentacle and then jump and do a
roundhouse kick to to the creature um it falls back dazed a little bit and shakes it off and still looks
like it's ready for ready for a little bit more action just in time for stick to do something yeah
that's what i okay i know what i need to do now i understand how character works
uh 13 will hit and your dice heavy maybe it's yeah maybe it's the difference in the table i don't know
like uh yeah this one is a little chalky yeah they are actually uh that's our heart six seven eight
damage each from bill flail swing all right well sir how do you want to have killed yeah
so there's the there's a javelin sticking in this thing like yes like in right through its head or
somewhere oh yeah it's like right there so unicorn word i hit it and like one fork of the boat anchor
of the flail or the hooks into it yanks it out and it kind of yanked and just blood and gore like
starts falling out of that hole and it just bleeds into yeah yeah all right all right so it's it's
showered yeah um as as uh as you uh yeah you get showered and gore this creep this creature falls to
the uh falls to the ground and stops moving um as you guys take uh take a moment to just kind of
see see where you're at you are actually in fact um you walked into the courtyard right in front of
your um right in front of your tavern that was the salty dog salty dog i don't know about anybody else
but i could use that drink now so the salty dog is right there in that corner over there
something that you do notice like you don't remember these um these tents and um things
being there um these aren't stalls these are actual like tents um this is weird none of this
it's supposed to be here we're not even supposed to be here today all right
so do we like go to a tent visit we can we can and
yeah when you investigate okay so you guys go to the tents you start looking around um and you do see
like there's equipment there um it definitely doesn't appear to be as old as the rest of the
thing the rest of the area um this was this is an old expedition probably might have been an old
expedition area where they were um they basically kind of set up camp um you do see remnants of like
this creature rummaging around in it so it's really clear that there was probably um you you would venture to
guess that uh this group was not prepared to deal with the monster that you just defeated um
what are you going to be from that fight i'm going to grant sp at the end of now ah so
um good question but um i'm going to wait until the end of the night to get back to you okay
um all right so uh also the um you you make it into the salty dog um and the stores are
the stores are low unfortunately you don't really see a um you don't really see a whole lot of
a whole lot of uh alcohol in there to be able to to be able to partake with um
but uh it was um well this used to be a good spot
now it's infested with crab people and frog monsters
um they probably had the same idea
did i notice anything weird about this place
well give me a second besides the frog monster besides there's a big frog monster
i would retain our luck points are they only for that combat you do retain great thank you yeah you
can use them outside of combat as oh okay um you just acquire them only in combat okay specifically
because they don't want you to just be running around yeah rolling a bunch of failures yeah i would
like to investigate yes um mr i'm going to need you specifically to roll a perception okay so that's
it's going to be the 20 mm-hmm and uh
five oh add your you have your look at your perception skill and that will tell you what your
modifier is uh 15 no
yeah it should be five either three from wisdom and two from your proficiency okay thank you so
maybe you were putting in a plus five and then you just didn't get paid so that's a good possibility
all right so you have 10 yeah okay um this thing you're probably hey there's a there's a fair amount
of graffiti around the um around the bar um just seems kind of seems kind of odd um you specifically skirk
you haven't seen any graffiti um in this bar before that is it so it's definitely something that kind of
has happened since you're since i was here what language is the graffiti in
good question um what languages do you know common and draconic
what's neither of those okay but do i recognize the language fair enough somebody's writing crap on
the walls i don't like it i have a few languages i know guess it's probably not celestial
um i don't think frog i think i know how to write on i think i just you know demonic
i think i i think i think i know some demonic um yeah you're probably not going to know this one
um yeah in unless um unless we've got a rogue in the party you're not going to recognize
if anybody has thieves can't as nope which i don't think i don't think you do from my criminal
background oh yeah got him shoot got him all right the first time i've seen that's gonna be useful oh my
god that's amazing so you just had to open your mouth you could have just kept it at you're
probably not gonna recognize it yeah yeah great um okay so you see um a fair amount of uh there's
just a bunch of a bunch of slurs in there and that kind of stuff um but the big thing that you
the big thing that you recognize is a name that pops up um the name is um
wait are the tide cutters
um this sparks your um this sparks your uh uh attention because the tide cutters are an old
pirate organization um that was around in the old world but you haven't heard head nor tail of them
since the flaming retribution um they're known for their leader um captain garrick tidebreaker
um and his um his uh
when at any cost um perspective uh so it's kind of like the
third pirate robertson the pirate that prevents you should know this because you just recently
watched that movie for the first time um but like basically you know it's big it's never takes
prisoners alive there you know there's this big whole um charisma around him um or folklore around him
um they are they were typically based in the south so seeing them have methane this far north is kind of
thought um and then you also see some you see some random things in there um give me a wisdom rule
so roll a d20 and then add your wisdom modifier to it
14 so 17 17 all right all right um so in in like the slurs and the along the the different things
that you see uh you do kind of pick up kind of like a theme of something that it's like it keeps on
talking about a pearl um there's some sort of pearl that um that they're looking for you see some
you see some stuff that looks like it could be the beginnings of like a map but it's not
it doesn't really make much sense to you um in there um
and then at the and then at the very like at the last point like where if you've got it's effectively
like a diary like they were just held up here for a long time gotcha and then at the and then like
one of the last one of the last entries in there is why is the wrong god
brax
same thing he's been asking
but um but yeah this definitely doesn't have the same vibe as the as the tents that you had
outside so this is definitely a different group that was that was holding up in here um as you look
around um uh it's go ahead and uh actually um little john uh go ahead and roll me a survival
on this place which would be how do i do that uh so you would roll a d20 failure die by your survival
oh that's a d10 the d20 this one what was the name of the leader in tidecutters did you say eric
i had 14 14 okay was it gear type that i don't know it was here it was captain garic tidebreaker
tidebreaker hey that was close you were close as you all right so the 14 um as you're like just kind
of you're kind of a sensing and um also you know you you know that um xander's kind of been keeping
design out for like good places to kind of hold up and that kind of thing um this bar is actually
pretty decent um it's like all of the all of the windows and everything are boarded up
it's already established that has kind of been a safe haven for an for an organization that has
clearly been here after the um after the um dog is so sad it's no worse
life is so hard right there are people up there having fun and i don't get to be there
that's what i'm scared of a touch um but it's something that like there there's definitely been
this is oh this is kind of an established spot so if you wanted to like use a use the use
some place as a staging ground um if you already cleared out like the the big threat here it might be
a good might be a good location for you so the reason why i'm giving this to you is you're the ranger
you're more you know you're more like survival focused and that kind of thing so um that's that's
kind of one of your character's schticks is like where's a good place to stay for good night
with my decent spot y'all's you need to tell us that you need to form the party with only if he wants to
yeah he could he could be informed that this is a great place to stay and be like nope i'm not
telling anybody yeah but you can choose to do something but probably to be a good team player
is probably yeah yeah yeah yeah sorry i'm not gonna be able to myself yeah as far as like the the role
playing aspect played in my head anyway so there you don't necessarily have to talking character or
anything if you don't want to you say like you can just say my character says something about this
or you know just describe your character's actions and that kind of thing you don't have to specifically
be like well i'm gonna talk like an orc so all right the wrong god
i love it i love it there we go where you can just jump right in that's great we'll find the rum
um the skirt knows where the hidden stash is okay hey i we i want to talk to the card to see if we
can put some protection some holy protection in this place no no no no okay okay uh the well you can
you can like you can use your religion skill to try and to try and
sure things up but as far as like game mechanics stuff no no no yeah that's not how that's not
how the the force works and so i i i'm trying to do something no and that's that's that's fine um
i mean you're a paladin so you're a holy warrior so you already did something yeah you holy warrior
okay so you don't have to be useful in every situation okay okay do you mind if i take
perimeter or something yeah absolutely you can totally you can totally walk through perimeter
and like totally ian like uh if if you if you want to if you want to do some like religious symbols and
that kind of stuff to try and add some protection you can do that just know that it's a flavor thing it's not
a game mechanic yeah that's right like if your character will do that yeah my character will do
that yeah absolutely you should do that yeah my character will so sorry i came sorry i was like no
that's just not gonna work because i i was just thinking that you were reaching for a game mechanic
no no i was balls i was was i was more less i'm the smallest i would say my character to do that
no absolutely so i want to talk to them talk to the cleric to see if we can put some stuff up yeah you
well i wouldn't talk to the cleric yeah you want to put some stuff up so so so so so we gave me to
pick up from some demons or some other creatures someone among other creatures
uh we're gonna stay here that would be wise i suppose
so yeah yeah we'll
put up some
some wards draw some symbols do whatever yeah yeah i'm also taking the printer i'm also putting salt
around their perimeter okay um do you have salt um i i believe i'm i i go and search for salt
there's salt water everywhere that's true but there's a lot of salt water to make even a little bit
he'll be at it all night just saying i'm i'm i'm pretty sure that i'm i'm gonna check the story to
see if there's any anything anything maybe a back of salt yeah yeah uh go ahead and roll me
perception for that okay see the back of salt
back of salt or anything well
there we go 11 and perception is 13.
okay there's no salt in here as far as you can tell oh i'm pretty salty
besides here there's no beer oh we're finding the private stash okay all right but i'm so i'm
so good just put some put some holy symbols up and go on the and put some stuff on the
put on stuff on the door sure back doors some windows gotcha um and are you gonna be patrolling
or yeah i will be patrolling okay cool uh so uh i'm gonna need two perception rolls for me for that
yeah and dave can skirt can make me a make me a perception roll
little damage because he knows the place what am i rolling for rum oh yeah okay my first roll is 11.
oh yeah that's pretty good uh 22. 22. all right no my first you indeed know where the secret stash
i'm right and it hasn't been so you have found yourself if you so desire okay okay skirk has like
this one time one's been kind of looking for it and like he hasn't quite calmed down from the fight
and he's almost been frantically looking for something and then when he finds it he's like
oh he's an alcoholic he's not an alcoholic he's just needs something to calm down oh okay
it was a big frog monster and a crab the size of him
cliche yeah but an alcoholic would justify it as well yeah that's true that's true okay um i'm never my
my back roll my back roll my back roll my back roll is actually was a 13 and my and my next roll is a 12. okay
all right so you're keeping you're keeping an eye you you don't see anything that necessarily
means that that jumps out to you as a
as a major threat major threat okay um so any of the rest of you guys have anything that you would
like to do um while while you guys are kind of taking time so here's a here's a good opportunity
to talk about short rest and how short breasts work oh um actually it occurs to me yeah um the short
rests you are are are times where you just kind of sit back and you take a breather they're not like
full-on like going to sleep or anything like that it's just like you take um and i'm i'm i'm actually
going to be a little bit more lenient than typical than what tells the value and how fooling this but
like short rest is like you take five and minutes take a breather and that kind of a thing um or in
or have a meal or you know something where you're just like taking a moment for yourself to recenter
or something kind of thing when you do that you can spend hit dice um in on your on your character
sheet there's a section that specifically says hit dice yeah and it will tell you the size of the
hit guy that you have and how many of them you have um so jason for you i'm pretty sure it's going to be
d10s um might be d8s okay okay yeah so you should have like two d8s ryan you have two d10s
dn you've got two d10s you have two d12s right yeah yeah and clerics d8s um when you take a short rest
you can spend those hit dice to regain hit points basically what you do is you is you spend a hit
die you you take that size die that you want and then you roll it and then you heal that many hit
points um your hit dice increase every time you love so your level two that's why you have two hit
dice when you hit level three you'll have three four four so on so forth um if you um if you do end
up multi-classing from which i haven't really decided whether or not we're going to be allowing
multi-classing in this in in this thing yet um if anybody specifically feels like they need to
then you can then we can have a discussion but um either way uh but if you do end up uh multi-classing
then you might be in a situation where you have different sized hit dice because if you go into
a class that has a different size hit die then you have so many hit dice for that class and so many
hits i split the other okay um but yeah i mean like i said i'm open to multi-classing but also it just
adds a lot of question will this will this look point help me out with the perception or no um
my larger number my 13. oh uh no that that that wouldn't uh that wouldn't that wouldn't have
increased any of your um any of your uh rules and i mean honestly man i had you roll just to see if
you rolled high enough to like like if you rolled a 20 or something then you might have seen something
but yeah okay no i'm not i was i was asking you you asked me to roll i thought you had something
i need to get better like the the points are brand new to me so i need it better about like
saying what the dc is exactly what i was like for every time i ask you to roll i honestly should
have a dc in mind and say i need you to roll a this or higher so you know you'll know this and
you're like once and when not too yep okay um so that's on me um i'm together i still still got a dmd
okay d and d i can just say give me a roll and then decide whether or not whether or not there's
information after it yeah yeah it's one of the things that it's one of the things i've always hated
about being this game forces me to actually be honest about the boss but we haven't taken any damage
and worried on yeah no reason it's been absolutely funny as we're taking a breather in a short rest
year skirk is gonna find some like whatever barware is left and just pour drinks for people and go
around and okay share a word and it's not hungry there's plenty of frog brains out in the store
i'm not eating the frog i'm not eating the frog either no thank you
i don't want to eat carnivores carnivores just taste them in general
carnivores are in an area yeah they don't want to eat a dog yeah
okay question is so do i roll my dc the hit place deck if you want to spin if you want to spin hit
dice and this is your opportunity to do that yeah i get that i'm at 15 health
i'm only missing five i might want to spin the hit die yet i'll just overrule i don't need to do that
wait is there anything specific that i can do or that or that that's me resting a bit
um no like i mean short rests just allow you to recover hit points okay yeah
but fair fair warning if you're like two or three hit points down from which i don't think you are
but if you are two or three i'm nice i'm i'm not hit points down it that's worth spending hit
die for yeah if you've got something that's like you're like with your d10s if you're like five to
six hit points down wouldn't do it no yeah like i'm only down five and my hit dice are 12 so i'm not
spending one because yeah so yeah so i'm just yeah i guess then one oh and he rolls a nine
that's great you didn't overheal at all that's great yeah i want to give him a healing potion
okay because i'm gonna move down one and add thank you
i'm sure that will come in handy at some point as a thank you but also i was shooting from 150 yards
uh why did i get these i don't know what happens i did over here well it's just wasted it's it's
wasted so that i mean that's typically why it's a bad idea because you don't want to you don't want to
rule about if if you overheal then you're just leaving healing on the table that's really okay
so me having like nine three points of missing and just be growing a big virtual rest it's it was
actually recommended me to for that yeah well especially with the long rest rules the way that
we the way that i'm doing them yeah like you don't want to you don't want to waste any of your
resources because you might we might want them later yeah all right so um okay um as uh as skirt
making drinks and pouring for her uh we'll just start for the conversation and say
she thinks she's so clever putting us together
mm-hmm you hate her because she tried to kill you i hate her because she brought me back
she peed on me during that fight okay okay
i'm just i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm genuine confused process
i'm basically thinking i took a short nap and i hear them arguing about
they're not arguing they're having a conversation quietly i'm still
i mean yeah if you want to have a deep theological conversation
if you want to step in if you want to step into that
i don't know what to say here i'm sorry i'm trying to roleplay yeah my guy i'm sure that she does
sure that she does too but in doing so she stole my purpose away
oh you sad broken bastards have another round i can do that
sorry i'm trying i'm trying to get i'm so angry i'm i'm trying here just to go
yeah no it's great it's it's fantastic don't don't apologize
it's just it's so awkward you know embrace the opposite
yep that's the best part of roleplay embrace doc we're having another drink last
i'm okay i'm i'm trying to be like that i'm trying to be a strict paladin like i'm uh
you're totally about it yep absolutely i don't know what what a strict disciplined
guy will say in this situation i know he will try to reprimand them
play i know i okay i'll be i'm how i reprimand
i don't unless this thing i'm reprimanding usually when paladins get get involved in religious debates
it involved it it devolves in my experience it devolves into total party kill
because everybody gets involved and everybody dies so okay what you're going to have to do this is kind
of this is kind of a little bit of a it's a little bit of a struggle for for a paladin is you're in a
situation where i i you don't necessarily agree with your com with your companions but you're
going to have to figure out how to live with them okay you don't want to be a bible thumper
okay kind of like the paladin hanging out with the rogue like no technically the paladin should
be beating the crap out of the rogue every time the rogue steals anything but that's not really how
how it's a that's not a good idea in a game yeah yeah no no dynamic right so so no it's more as
as well as i'm trying to so i mean your character's approach could be and i think this is what you're
going for but your character's approach is you're like these people they don't understand being they
don't understand what value meringue is is bringing and i want them to see the light yeah yes that's
you're not like these people are heretics and i have to kill them no no no no no as well as different
ingrates from well no i wouldn't go that far because ingrates turned into heretics and heretics
turn into i have to kill them you are oathful you are oath sworn not yet but in level three you'll be
oath sworn as a paladin and you're gonna have to be able to navigate that if you start othering people
if you're through by calling them heretics or calling them ingrates you're you're you're you're
cruising for a reason no i'm okay okay okay the misguided is perfect yes misguided yeah no that that's
that's fine um but yeah no and like honest and honestly when it comes to these role-playing
situations ian just dive in nope don't explain yourself yeah just dive in just do it do what you
can't do what you think you can do don't feel like you have to explain me where your character's coming
from or anything like that just yeah get in there start talking yeah because i i have i have very much
respect for moraine because he's because i believe my i my arthur believes that he she's the one who saved
this right and he so yeah i mean again don't either explain everything yeah just get in there when yeah
when you're like i want to participate in this conversation just get in there get in there yeah
six so i'm so yeah all right um so we we are at the end of of our uh of our first night um
we didn't get we didn't get terribly far but we got about as far as i was forcing and we were going to
um and i would say we did hit we stayed on basket up and did as far as he thought we were gonna get
it i i i'm starting to get a grasp of how this group go yeah so we retain these between sessions
yes i'm gonna ask you to retain that for me i'm gonna make a note for where your luck is uh there
is there's a lot spot in there um and we've built in that um well so i don't keep his as far as
excuse me that's what i don't keep this i don't this point i don't i don't keep that i don't keep
the card uh where is the spot right here oh this one oh this one's been away oh let's go put it
right here yeah yeah it's right there thank you um there you go there's all this for you
thank you for running and posting sir oh indeed
awesome oh yeah xp is important
you
but i will likewise get faster at this all right um xp 900
which for those of you who are in the know that don't mean level two
uh okay but so i gotta pick out some class probably yes yeah
what's the xp what's the xp on this uh it is at the top right nope not there all right so right next
to your level there so right there level xp it's a very small box for us okay okay what's my xp 900
it's not just a thousand every time yeah yeah all right cool so yeah so for before next session we're gonna
actually have they're gonna need to level up um so we'll get into level three you will not be leveling this quickly all the time but you but i didn't want to start you at level three because level three adds a bunch of more
bells and whistles yeah and i wanted you to get at least some experience with this system before i give you all those
questions before you get more points yeah yeah exactly so now we will at least have a little bit
more of an idea about what those things apply um so we'll need to let me make sure that we get that done
before the next session which should be two weeks out yep uh is that what we're doing this one seven two
weeks and two okay yeah i forgot to ask that the other day yeah with a couple of exceptions like i mean obviously
if it falls on it's gonna say we might hit a thanksgiving there i don't know okay yeah yeah
we're not meeting on thanksgiving yeah we're not and then really i don't want to go visit my family on
right um yeah just so but yeah so that's kind of that's kind of what what's gonna look like it'll be a
bi-weekly meeting it'll be a bi-weekly uh game um we won't be falling on thanksgiving if we don't
what are the set classes uh it's different per it's different per class yeah and before the for
for pallet night we'll we'll need to go through that separately yeah you want us to do that before
next time uh it's possible okay um so for those of you who have never right um i'd be more than happy
get with you in between times and just kind of walk through everything and make sure that you're all
set up um and i would and i'm thinking it'd be good to do it like separately just because when i tried
to get everybody together to build characters all together and half of my group was were were people
that were new players it makes it made it really hard for me to give you guys the each of you the
attention that you deserve yeah so um so i'm we can we can try and see if you need us some other time
and just do it separately so we can make sure that everybody remembers guys oh yeah yeah thank you
all right thanks everybody i really appreciate you standing running yep and nice to see you all again
yeah yeah oh oh y'all in a couple weeks yes sir
everybody drive safe
