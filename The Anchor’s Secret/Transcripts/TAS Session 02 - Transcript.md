I'm not saying
I'm not an idiot
that's not what I'm saying
alright
that's hilarious
what is on the back of this
just to make it easier to pick up
exactly
because if it was just a washer
you don't have super fingernails
I'm impressed
I've got custom hardware coming in
I'm working on it
I'm working on it
I'm working on it
I'm working on it
alright
papa
the chief of his men
stole the queen from her
cc
cc
one last minute
you all were
hired by
hired being
a understatement
you were
volunteers
to step into
the tide watch ward
a place that was
up until six months ago
a relatively safe
haven
in a world
in chaos
a year ago
the sky fell
fire and brimstone
landed
on the continent
destroying
every aspect
of
the life that you knew
prior to that
just to
give everyone
a little bit
better of an idea
this is the world
that you were
married
once
here
now
as the
after the
flaming
retribution
this
is the world
that you know
hmm
penmaris
itself
survived
but the land
to
the beginning
to
penmaris
was destroyed
the land
itself
seemed to
have
the
the land
itself
sank
into the
sea
under the
onslaught
of fire
and brimstone
penmaris
itself
did survive
but only
just
the
ruins
of
penmaris
has
become
what is
known as
new penmaris
in
new penmaris
you
the rebuild
occurred
as you guys
know
the
and then
six months
after that
the
um
six months
after that
the
west
the western
portion
which is
this part
of penmaris
was
um
a
storm
cloud
moved in
um
a bunch
of what
are referred
to as
salt
spawn
which are
monsters
sea monsters
came into
the war
and
overtook it
there was
no way
to be able
to keep
everything
at bay
so in
order to
be able
to save
it the
group
uh
the
um
the city
walled off
that portion
of the
uh
that portion
of the
ward
and basically
left it
for lost
however now
we are in a
place where
and i know
i'm rehashing
a lot of
stuff but
we'll
stop rehashing
after a little
bit
um
after
um
after about
six months
um
there has
been a
huge
in a
huge
onslaught
of refugees
people have
been flooding
into
um
new pen
maris
because it's
one of the
only bastions
of civilization
left in
the region
um
so in
order for
people to
be able to
stay in
in the
city
um
they need
to be able
to expand
and that is
why
there is
this push
to have
to figure
out a
way of
being able
to resettle
um
the tide
watch
ward
not only
that but
a majority
of the
docks
and a
majority
of the
you know
the
sea
uh
the
the sea
the ship
rights
and those
areas
that were
designed
to build
and
and house
ships
the marinas
are mostly
in that
ward as
well
um
and there
isn't really
a good
place
in the rest
of new pen
maris
the rest
of new pen
maris
is
for the
most part
landlocked
there's like
one small
section
um
that isn't
so in
order to
be able
to reopen
trade
be able
to see
if they
can see
if we
can find
more
civilizations
more people
that that
survived the
flaming
retribution
um
the
the city
itself
needs to
retake
these marinas
so
you each
have been
given a
specific
um
a specific
side quest
of things
that your
character
was specifically
asked to do
um
skirk
and arthur
are
um
demon
hunting
there was
a demon
yes
um
there was
a demon
that
got
summoned
um
accidentally
and then
uh
when it
wasn't
able to
be contained
it fled
into the
tidewatch
ward
um
and there
is some
uncertainty
as to
whether or
not there
is something
that needs
to be
done about
that demon
you generally
don't like
to just
leave demons
hanging around
um
they have a
tendency
to cause
trouble
um
mistral
has found
some
pirate maps
and
there's
at least
one
that seems
to be
referencing
something
in the
tidewatch
ward
um
it's not
a full
map
it's a
partial
map
but it
does
appear
to be
but there
does appear
to be
something
happening
in
tidewatch
ward
that
has
sparked
your
interest
um
zander
uh
you have
a
friend
just
one
and
that
friend
um
disappeared
about a
week ago
and
where he
disappeared
um
was
pretty
close
to
the
tide
watch
ward
um
so
it is
your
intention
to
not
only
help
the
people
out
but
also
look
for
your
friend
and
see
if
there's
some
way
that
you
might
be
able
to
rescue
him
and
or
um
and or
at least
figure out
what
happened
you
need to
break it
in bro
you had
a
friend
you
don't
have
one
anymore
well
um
seems
lucky
little
john
you
were
um
thank you
you
have
in your
in your
maker bathroom
as somebody
who likes
crafting
things
um
you
have
noticed
that there
is this
new
um
there's this
new
um
material
that has
been
surfacing
and it
appears to
be coming
from the
tidewatch
warp
it's called
coralite
um
you are
on the
search
for more
of it
to determine
where it
came from
and
um
jesri
jesri
jesri
jesri
that's
different
sorry
jesri
the first
half
right
adore
chaos
he's dead
i keep it
and
it seemed
like a
good
opportunity
for you
to uh
for you
to be
able to
um
indulge
in a little
excitement
for you
to go
into the
tidewatch
warp
so much
so
that you
decided to
skip the
line
and go
in a
day
early
yep
awesome
it's about
right
all things
could possibly
warp
so
let's resolve
that
first
oh wait
wait wait
i do need
to get us
to where
we are
you guys
into the
tidewatch
warp
sure did
um
you were
taken
uh
you
you
got
went straight
to um
the salty
dog tavern
uh
which is
an old
an old
place
for
um
an old
place
for skirk
that's
where he
and his
dog
and friends
used to
hang out
um
on your way
there
you were
attacked
by
what
appeared
to be
crabs
with
uh
they were
hermit crabs
but
they're
uh
but the
shells
that they
chose
to um
the
shells
that they
chose
to have
were
skulls
um
so you
uh
were
fighting
those
and were
able to
defeat
most of
them
when some
sort of
a large
frog
like
monster
decided to
eat the
last one
and you
had to
defeat that
as well
um
you were
able to
do so
um
and you
were able
to make
it to
the salty
dog
in
uh
once
there
um
you were
able to
find
some
secret
stash
as all
the rum
was gone
and
uh
be able
to uh
you know
partake to
settle your
nerves a
little bit
um
mistral
you
everybody
noticed
but you're
the only one
that had
the ability
to read
it
there was
this strange
script
scrawled all
over the
walls
um
and it
was
um
it was
thieves
can't
um
you
know thieves
can't
and you
were able
to read
it
and there
were
and these
were the
scrawls
of um
what appears
to be
a pirate
group
specifically
the tide
cutters
which um
you were
not aware
were still
in business
but apparently
they are
at least
they were
sometime
in the past
six months
um
and that
is where
we were
that's where
we landed
so
jesrick
yeah
you came
in early
i did
um
and you
started heading
north um
northeast
when you
started going
that way
you um
very quickly
found
that some
of the
excitement
that you
were looking
for may
have been
a little
bit more
than what
you could
uh what
you had
bargained
for
um there
appears to
be an
army
of
automatons
that are
hanging out
at the
docks
in the
and they
and you
kind of
observe them
a little
bit
and they
are very
unfriendly
to outsiders
like no
matter what
it was
that made
it into
that made
it into
a certain
parameter
they would
immediately be
attacked and
immediately be
killed
um so
as you were
thinking about
that uh
you
decided that
maybe north
wasn't the
best direction
for now
maybe later
um and
you also
noticed that
your compass
had started
started making
star chart
signals
and appeared
to be pointing
you more
towards this
set
so you
happened to
find a um
you happened to
find an old
tavern um
and found
uh found a
space in a
secret compartment
over there to
kind of like
rest up while
you uh while
you figured out
what to do
next
um
Kirk you
go in for
you go into
your the
secret space
in the uh
where where
the uh where
the good stuff
is and
you start you
know you
start
messing around
and
Jesric you
hear something
it like
something in
front of the
shelf that
you're on
is messing
with the
bottles and
not necessarily
being gentle
about it
so you
wake up to
bottles clinking
and all kinds
of all kinds
of stuff
with that
what do
you do
uh
Jesric
shoots up
uh and
sort of
from his
back pulls
this crossbow
out
looks at
where he's
looks at
where the
noise is
coming from
and yells
uh
and he
goes and he
goes to
fire if he
doesn't recognize
you do
recognize that
this was one
of the uh one
of the people
that you were
uh in the
same room
with okay
so we are
not going to
start off
with a player

recognize him

description

i am
a
tall
four foot
five
yes
uh
i i do
have the
classic red
pointed gnome
hat
um
old
beard that
covers most
of my body
uh
he's got
those
old
man
wrinkled
hands
where
like
you can
see the
bones
and all
of the
veins
uh
his skin
is
transparent
almost
um
he is just
he looks like
he probably
should have
died 50
years ago
but uh
still kicking
and uh
he's got
a
crossbow
yeah
oh yeah
a full
size longbow
would be
out of your
reach
yeah he would
definitely not be
able to do a
longbow
um
okay
so
um
next up
so you guys
are setting
up for the
night
yeah
um
kind of
getting
getting a
feel of
the the
area
doing
doing
um
religious
wards
setting up
figuring your
best posts
um
misceral
uh
you're kind
of looking
at that
at that
pirate
um
that pirate
scroll
um
a little
bit
and when
you do
um
like after
a bit
something just
kind of
pops out
at you
especially as
somebody who's
you know
recently become
a treasure
hunter
you you
you have
this
like
kind of like
everybody
like when
you when
you first
get a jeep
you realize
how many
jeeps there
are out
there and
that kind
of thing
it's a
similar sort
of thing
for you
you see
riddles
and
mysteries
everywhere
you look
and one
of the
things that
is written
on the
wall
is in
fact a
riddle
it says
um
it says
where the
rum runs
dry and
secrets sleep
behind the
dog the
gold runs
deep
and being
that you're
a little bit
on a
treasure hunt
um
the word
gold
kind of
pops out
at you
uh
shines
shines
yes
we saw
the writing
on the
one
all that
glitters
is not
gold
though
um
if we're
going to
be
if the
intention
is to
uh
rest
uh
i'm going
to use
a couple
of my
uh
shards
of creation
i'm going
to make
a shield
and then
like a
high tension
spring
okay
and like
booby trap
the front
door
to where
if i'm
uh
i have
a reaction
uh
uh
infusion
that
if a
monster
uh
approaches
the door
the shield
will like
the the
release on
the spring
will blast
out the
shield
and like
push it
away at
least
okay
sick
awesome
sounds good
to me
um
the rest
of you
um
if you
there is
anybody
who is
uh
keeping
watch
or anything
like that
um
i'm not
gonna make
you roll
uh
you do
see
monsters
like here
and there
um
there are
some
other
some other
creatures
that are
kind of
odd
that you've
never really
seen
anywhere
before
um
they look
like
um
they used
to be
people
but
their
skin
is kind
of like
overgrown
with coral
um
right
they're
yeah
they
they don't
appear to be
like fish
like in
nature
it's just
like there's
like
coral
that's just
growing out
of their
skin
so
um
but none
of them
have
approached
the
tavern
um
and
the
and the
the
coral
people
appear to
be like
more
on the
southern
side
you don't
really see
them
north of
where you
are
but there
are a
number of
there are
a number
of um
other
creatures
that you
see
you see
more of
the bone
crabs
um
you see
a couple
of different
variations
of like
frog-like
monsters
some of
them
have
like
super
sharp
teeth
and
a bunch
of
tentacles
some of
them
have
eye
stalks
and
not
sharp
teeth
and are
significantly
larger
um
just a bunch
of different
like
mutations
of
sea
creatures
uh
as well
as
uh
you've
seen
a few
um
what appear
to be
like
large
alligators
but they're
completely
transparent
kind of
like the
um
see-through
the
see-through
no
he's just
mostly
transparently
like
you
you are
able to
see
their
um
you're able
to see
their bones
and their
organs
through
their
through
their skin
so it's
like those
it's like
those
see-through
feet
question
do we
have maps
of the
area
uh
you have
maps
what
i mean
you
you
know
the
area
yeah
yeah
but
i just
want
to go
and modify
my map
to
know
if i
search
the areas
of my
lookout
if i can
do that
sure
yeah
again
like are
these things
that are
just wandering
are they
just wandering
around aimlessly
like they're
just kind
of
it's
like these
are just
creatures
that are
just
existing
just patrolling
they gotta keep
moving to
breathe
like that's
that's
um
would i help you
with anything
or would i have
favor
did you like
to roll
post anything
with that
or just
favor
it's fine
you can update
your map
accordingly
no problem
yeah
more or less
i'm more or less
i'm more or less
i'm marking
the tavern
as our base
yeah
wasn't there
something
like outside
in one of the
tents that we
found that was
interesting that i'm
not remembering
well you did
notice that
there that like
the tents themselves
looked like they
were um
they they looked
like they were
inhabited by
by um
not pirates
but like inhabited
by like soldiers
and that kind of
thing it hadn't
oh that's right
that's right
that's right
um but it was
basically like
but there's
nobody there
yeah
i mean i think
the interesting
thing that that
you guys noticed
specifically as you
were walking in
you were expecting
to see bodies
everywhere
because of the
club
that's right
that's i think
did anybody have
a crafting
is there like
crafting as a
skill because i
was going to
see if we could
take down one of
the tents for
annex
you can just
do that
okay
i think
i would
i would turn
down the tent
they've got
i've got
them for
hammocks
and you're
working on
whatever the
hell it is
you're doing
with your
brain
you know
let me have
something to
sleep on
a little bit
more comfortable
to sleep on
i hope you
get to see
it
it's great
when a monster
comes close
this ear
magic is going
to detect it
explode this
frame
hit the monster
about 20
feet that way
skirt kind
of
starts poking
at it a little
bit and looking
at it
you gotta be a
monster
you choose on
that one for
quite a while
not going near
it
he probably
understands the
mechanism because
i have like
people all
sort of
tinkering up
the line
yeah
or understand
the magic
part
yeah
that's the
magic part
the spring i
get spring i
understand
so i i kind
of just pulled
the stuff out
i have these
floating motes
i kind of
pulled one
down pulled
another one
down to make
the spring and
then the shield
smash them
together
tinker the
mechanism
release the
spring
okay
so um
we
anybody else
want to do
anything
before
before we
bed down
for the
night
so my
my uh
star trek
compass
it uh
it was
pointing me
to this
tavern
it was
pointing you
south
okay
so not
was not
specifically
to this
tavern
this tavern
was on
the way
yeah
you just
kind of
okay
face hold
your way
into that
one
well
better
luck
that's
what i
always
said
could you
try it
this way
and use
it as a
trampoline
yeah but i
didn't do it
that time
jason are you
sure you don't
want to do
anything
you don't have
to do anything
but i did
drop a clue
on you and i
don't know if
that i don't
know if that
i don't know
if i was
explicit about
that so
explicitly
here's a
clue if you
don't want to
explore it that's
fine we can
move on but
i didn't want
to
just assume
we're picking
up why it
was no doubt
no you're
good
was the
riddle in
thieves camp
specifically
it was
okay
which means
the
i have
zero
it's
scribbles
yeah
what was
can you
repeat
this
it is
where the
rum runs
drop in
secret sleep
behind the
dog the
gold runs
deep
it
appears to me
that i should
have printed
that out
oh you're
right
and
jason you
do not
have to
figure that
one out
yourself
if you
include the
group then
you can
include
everybody's
brain in
that as
well so
you said
that is
in the
thieves
camp
yeah so
it's
basically
like it's
a pirate
leaving a
cryptic
message
on the
wall
about
gold
okay
uh yeah
so before
we go to
bed or
before we
kind of
cash out
for the
night i
don't know
if anybody's
kind of
standing up
to watch
guard
i'm in the
guard
okay
yeah i
kind of
pull everybody
in give
them a little
translation of
what it
says
basically just
saying you
know give
you something
to mull
over i
think yes
as you're
laying down
for the
night and
kind of
maybe we
can come
up with
something on
on what
or where
where it
may lead
us or
what it
may be
i'm sorry
yeah i
i have an
idea maybe
something in
the hidden
room
he found
where the
room runs
dry and
secret
sleeps
behind the
dog
the
gold
runs
deep
and what's
the name
of the
tempered
again
it's a
salty
dog
it's a
good
room
well
maybe
behind
the
rum
say
maybe
behind
the
rum
counts
habit
there's
are there
any secret
rooms here
you
loved you
were in
one
i was in
one
already
apparently
you found
the rum
first
you found
the good
stuff
drank it
off
but
the secret
room is not
where the
rum
runs
dry
it's full
of rum
it's where
the rum
the dry
rum is
oh
wait
wait
wait
how can
rum
rum
he
claims
i mean
it seems
like there's
probably
some place
around here
that's got
something
yeah
yeah
clearly
point in
here
is there
so i spent
a lot of
time here
right
is there
any
like
motifs
or
carvings
or
somethings
of dogs
around
um
there's
i mean
also what's
behind the
building
maybe so many
people behind
the building
there's an
alley behind
the building
yeah
um
there are
a number
of
motifs
of dogs
here
not
not
couple
of the
playing
over
yeah
i mean
they've
got
they've
leaned
into
the dog
motif
a bit
um
the
the
um
the sign
itself
has
has a
dog
with a
salt
shaker
above it
you know
just that
kind of
stuff
um
so
yeah
so that
that's kind
of what
you've got
maybe
there are
like i mean
you can
start looking
behind pictures
or something
wait
i think
i think
i have
any
maybe
maybe
there's
maybe
there's
the
swishes
in
in some
rooms
like
well
you
you
you go
start
searching
through
rooms
yeah
i'll
search
in
where
i
think
sure
where
the
weirdo
points
out
two
sort
of
thing
i
hit
it
hit
it
roll
a
15
perception
uh
15
is
going
to
just
go
around
to
everywhere
where
there
might
be
like
a
dog
painted
on
something
or
and
just
start
smashing
those
areas
with
his
uh
slayle
slash
anchor
on a
chain
all right
um
nope
not behind
this
one
yeah
you
you
go
on
a
screen
and
uh
you are
not
able to
find
anything
on any
of those
on any
of those
thieves
um
okay
so
not behind
this one
either
okay
here we go
so
yeah
and from
before
there
was
uh
wasn't
there
something
that's
what
it's a
twelve
so add
your
perception
to it
wasn't
there
some
a
pearl
as well
uh
yeah
they
they
they do
reference
a pearl
um
in
in the
um
in the
writings
but that's
not part
of this
specific piece
but
they appear
to be
as far as
you can tell
they appear
to be
searching
for some
sort of
pearl
okay
uh
plus two
so that's
fourteen
okay
uh
yeah
you
you aren't
able to find
any areas
that are
obviously
like hidden
locks
or anything
so
aren't
you
yep
that's
you
yeah
that was
the third key
I wouldn't
keep
out of it
um
skirt
because
I don't
have ideas
um
I mean
I can
always
try and
do some
some
investigating
around the
building
take a
step outside
in the alleyway
going on
this
okay
um
as you
as you
go around
back
oh
as uh
sorry
as uh
uh
Jezric
stays up
to leave
um
I'll just
kind of
silently
get up
and follow
okay
so
no one
should be
alone
probably
it's dangerous
to go
alone
take this
um
so
all right
uh
so the alley
behind the salty
dog is
narrow and
damp
it's
hemmed
in
by
leaning
stone walls
that are
slicked with
mist
rusted
lanterns
brackets
cling to
the masonry
are there
any good
brackets
could be
have to
go
you see
as you
also see
similar
graffiti
in the alley
is what
you saw
in the salty
dog
um
the
um
this
is a
combination
of
dwarven
which is
the language
of magic
in this
world
and
thieves
kid
the dwarven
stuff you
can kind
of
make out
if you
do not
have
dwarven
you do not
know
what's
there
i decided
i wanted to
know my
native language
you see
fire
break
um
you also
see a
you
also see
a broken
pipe near
a stack
of empty
crates
and the
scent of
salt water
drifts from
the ocean
that's visible
down the
alley
at the
far end
there's some
sort of
clockwork
mechanism
leaning up
against the
wall
with a
number of
parts strewn
across the
alley
can i
somehow
determine what
this clockwork
apparatus is
supposed to
do
uh
do you have
an ability
that does
that
um
well
i you know
i'm not
i'm not
like super
so i don't
walk out
the
mechanist
i imagine
that yes
that's the
answer
cipher clock
mechanism
plus four
i have the
eyes of a
maker
so
nope
that's not
gonna do
anything
seems like
it would
have but
it didn't
okay
well
while you're
looking i'm
just gonna
i'm just
gonna
hand wave
some stuff
yeah yeah
so uh
you do make
it over to
that mechanism
it appears
to be
like on
first glance
it appears
to be
useless
okay
um
however
there
upon
further
inspection
um
you notice
that it's
like actually
attached to
the wall
but it's
designed to
look like
it's
not
it's
designed
to look
like it's
not a
part of
the wall
and it's
also designed
to look
like it's
some sort
of like
broken down
vehicle or
something
okay um
well i don't
know if i can
know exactly
what it
does
but i do
have a good
few years
of tinkering
expertise
i might be
able to
fix it
okay
um
upon
like
it's not
broken
no
you can
definitely
fix it
i did it
it was just
that good
eight broke
don't fix
it
uh
well
fix
what's that
so skirk
can
fix
that's right
i can fix
there's
absolutely
nothing going
nothing wrong
with trying to
turn this thing
on right
because i'm
going to do
that
go for it
i'm going to
try to do
that um
okay so
so some of the
dragon tells us
saw you you
look for it
you look for
an on button
some sort of
thing
um and
this thing
it's got no
purpose
it's got no
purpose
it's got no
on button
you do see
that like
the place
where it's
attached to
to the wall
there's like
a gear
um a
it's like
a giant
one tooth
gear
okay
that's just
sticking out
and it's
attached to
a
it's attached
to a shaft
that is
that goes
into the
wall
itself
um
and that
appears to be
like the
actual part
of the thing
that functions
the rest of
it's just
flare
oh
well
uh
you want
to spin it
yes
i'll
cut the thing
i'm good
do it
spin
quick
quick
quick
quick
quick
oh
it's
perfect
spin
i gave up
nothing
it's broken
all right
all right
all right
all right
so
i'll
i'll uh
go back
inside
there's some
more of that
scribbling stuff
back there
and i've broken
gear but that's
about it
you fix it
are there any
good brackets
you find some
good brackets
only one or two
i'll meet them
um
is there
maybe something
else on the
other side
of that
wall
oh
what's
the gap
is there
or is there
a gap
like where the
air goes
into the
wall
um
like
the
it
the
like how
long
of a shaft
do you see
before himself
no it's like
the gears going
to the wall
right
yeah
i'll watch the
book
yeah yeah
sorry
i'm sorry
there's there's a
a shaft that's
going to the wall
the gear is like
a wheel
so it's not the
wheel of fortune
ah
it's like
a steering wheel
got it
okay so there's a
shaft that goes
into the wall
okay
is it
wash was there
like a room
around it
uh
there's not
a lot of room
around it
but you know
obviously there's
there's like
a little bit
so it can
spin
okay
it does
it does
appear to be
that's
the function
of this
gear
yeah
you have to
be able to
spin
sick
i'm gonna
cast dancing
lights
and i'm gonna
send a light
through that
small phone
to whatever
is beyond
it
all right
i assume i won't
be able to see
anything from
this side
but
um
yeah so
you
basically
have the
lights go
through the
through the
thing
um you see
some some
light flash
out of it
um
roll a
dc 20
perception
also
important question
is it
magical
yes
that means
that i do
know
that is
a good
question
um
i don't
believe that
it is
magical
actually
i'm the
gm
it's not
magical
okay
oh yes
yes yes
block me sir
i failed
uh well that
only happens
in comic
oh
i thought it
was every
skill check
okay
no
that is
fine
the primary
purpose of me
doing that
was not to
be able to
see immediately
believe
so uh so
yeah so it
goes in there
you don't you
don't see any
like you do
see the lights
going through
that specific
um hole and
you see them
moving around
so clearly
like there's
space yeah
yeah so it's
not like it
just goes in
and doesn't
have any room
to move
but you aren't
able to
determine if
there if
there's any
light coming
through any
other cracks
cracks or
crevices
yeah yeah
yep no
problem
uh as we
kind of walk
back um
so you left
those lights
up if there
is a way to
access the
space from
inside we
might be able
to see the
lights moving
around from
the inside
yeah which
wall is it
it's the
back wall
no like if
we're like
where is this
space if it
was coming
into the
building where
would it
theoretically be
coming into
the building
um it would
guess in my
question yeah
so like what's
the nearest
interior wall
to yeah you
get so yeah
yeah so the
kitchen there
is the gear
the mechanism
itself is
actually dead
center okay
um when you
go back to
the to the
back part
there
you kind
of like
you don't
see like a
bulge or
anything back
there however
you as you're
kind of like
doing some
pacing and
you know you
were back in
the back
no you weren't
in the back
i was in the
yeah yeah
but after
after a little
bit of
investigation
like you're
able to
determine that
the far
left
or the far
right wall
um is
about
five
to ten
feet
shorter
than it
should be
based off
the exterior
what is
this wall
made of
so
it's
a problem
what was
this
there's
thieves
camp
there's
thieves
camp
in the
yeah
yeah
yeah
i definitely
i definitely
let's like
one
sorry
i i misunderstood
with ramsey
i thought we were
already coming
back in
and that's when
i was like
yeah
there's more
of that
squiggly
stuff
yeah
so
there's more
of that
squiggly
stuff
right there
yeah
all right
they come
back in
uh
mention the
more scribbly
stuff
you guys
sketch it
no
just go
and look
at it
i'm going
with him
and uh
see if
there's any
uh
anything else
that kind
of pops
out that
may help
with the
riddle
uh
or even
more
riddles
or clues
out there
great
right
it is
i'm gonna
follow
oh my god
we might
have to
come back
and stick
his
shabby
head
and see
that he's
older
if
yeah
if all
else
fails
you got
an anchor
and a
chain
so you
know
you can
give it
your best
um
okay
so you
make it
out there
you look
at the
you look
at the
scribbles
and um
does anybody
here have
dwarven as
a language
i think i
might do
on my
i need to
check my
guards
um
well the
thieves
can't
bit
um
you see
a
um
you see
another riddle
it says
turn the
truth
to what
all sailors
crave
the sea
the flame
the stone
and winds
that misbehave
it says
and
and
and
since
i
there
there have
already been
some
reveals
that took
place
when
jazz
rick was
there
the gear
it's
plugged
into
the wall
and it's
a one
tooth
gear
so
and it
spins
kind of
like uh
it clicks
whenever it
spins
wait
i'm gonna
go up to
it
and i'm
gonna spin
it till
it clicks
and push
it
uh
not hard
no it
just
you you
do that
um
and like
it you
move it
like just
a little
bit and
it's
clicking
so it's
like it's
like
does it
does it
sound like
a vault
it does
have something
similar to
that yes
okay
okay
what was the
riddle again
um
turn the
tooth to
what sailors
crave
the sea
the flame
the stone
and winds
that misbehave
do you have
dwarven
uh
no i do
not
i have
i have
i have
common
kobold
and elven
i recommended
that's i
recommended
dwarven to
each one
of you
i don't
believe that
that was
ever recommended
i said
them well
i i i said
the most
common languages
in in this
region
elven and
dwarven as
they're the
mercantile
languages
we were
about
in my case
at least
like i was
limited to
one language
so it's like
common and
the language
might
wait
no
yeah
i i
give it
i'm not
i'm not
i'm not
dissing your
decisions
i'll just
i was just
now
rassing you
guys a little
bit
not a big
deal
um
okay so
what you guys
have determined
is that
this is
a
this is
a
it's a
lock
um
sort of
kind of
like a
locker
style
lock key
the tooth
is obviously
the arrow
and
you need
to point
it in
you have
need to
point it
towards
the sea
the flame
the stone
and the
winds
that misbehave
or the winds
okay
um so
point it
at the
four
elements
there
okay
i'm gonna
i'm gonna
have to
find
i i
i didn't
get that
i didn't
get the
scripting
of the
alley
i i
i was
more
yeah
so the
alley
there
is
um
yeah
so it's
a cobblestone
alley
there
it's
it goes
straight
to the
sea
you can
see the
sea in
the distance
okay
there are
a number
of
pipes
and
and
uh
mechanisms
that are
just kind
of like
strewn
around
wait
wait
wait
wait
wait
do i
have
do i
have
a
ability
to
help
me
with
perception
basically
that's
my
that's
uh
well
i mean
perception
isn't
going to
specifically
help you
in this
situation
no no
no
no
i mean
you've
seen
what you
can
see
yeah
yeah
yeah
if you
have any
clarifying
questions
i can
give
clarifying
i can
give
answers
to
those
just
more
that's
my
previous
role
about
looking
for
secret
actions
and
whatever
there's
clear
sight
to the
sea
yep
when
where
is it
going
where is it
coming from
well
it's
actually
pretty calm
right now
when
is it
misbehave
specifically
when
is it
misbehave
it doesn't
behave
it doesn't
you mean
when
is it
misbehave
well
where
where do
um
where do
sailors
look
when
they
um
when
they're
stranded
at sea
no
idea
the
stars
the
stars
the
sailors
sailors
with the
the air
they
they look
they look
towards the
sky
so
so
okay
so
we have
the water
we have
the sky
we need
earth
which is
down
and fire
which is
probably
just the
other way
because
it's
so we
just
spin it
I'm looking
for the
fire
I don't
see any
fire
there are
there's
zero
fire
around
here
earth
in the
kitchen
or
something
there's
everything
in the
kitchen
so
yeah
there's
that
there
are
some
there
used
to
be
lamps
I was
just
going
to say
that
you
say
there
was
lanterns
or
something
street
lanterns
that
were
strewn
about
just
need to
figure out
which
one's
the
right
one
are
they
all
the
same
size
they're
about
yeah
any
fancy
markings
on one
of them
no
but there
is this
fancy
marking
on the
wall
that's
written
in
dwarven
that
is
the
language
of
magic
that
you
guys
there's
nobody
can
wait
don't
worry
do
not
divine
one
apparently
can
you
use
anything
can
you
can
use
a
spell
to
get
is
it
I
don't
think
I
don't
think
I
don't
think
I
don't
think
I
have
it
well
you
guys
can
just
try
stuff
out
yeah
you're
effectively
at a
school
locker
right
so
you
just
gotta
look
it
all
right
so
from
what
I
understand
from
what
we
got
going
on
here
um
I
don't
know
you've
got
you've
got
you guys
are
thinking
you
want
to
point
it
at
the
sea
you
want
to
point
it
at
the
ground
you
want
to
point
it
at
the
sky
and
you
want
to
point
it
at
that
rune
that's
on
the
thing
um
probably
in the
order
of
the
thing
okay
so
you're
pointing
it
at
the
sea
first
yeah
you
spin
it
over
to
where
the
flame
rune
is
or
the
assumed
flame
rune
you
spin
it
back
down
to
point
it
directly
at
the
ground
and
then
you
spin
it
back
up
directly
to
the
sky
and
when
you do
that
you hear
a click
and a
clockwork
mechanism
running
through the
walls
and as
you do
that
or as
you hear
that
you look
over to
the
left hand
side
and where
the edge
of the
wall is
there
appears to
be
the wall
itself
progressively
building
into
the
wall
and
then
opening
up
like
shifting
back
and
there
is a
doorway
so
okay
before
I thought
that was
going to be
way easier
riddles are
hard
when designing
puzzles for
role-playing
games
you must
ask
yourself
how
did
a
kindergartner
solve
this
if not
too hard
no and
yeah it
it's
it's
perfectly
fine
I'm just
I was like
oh man
I have an
eight
intelligence
there'd be
no help
well I was
expecting you
to like
play your
characters
intelligence
down
I play
characters
down
so you
have a
door that
has opened
up what
you do
are we
all out
there
dancing
lights are
still in
there
well as
of right
now
as I
understand
it
oh yeah
you do
see
light
coming
up
so
I think
that's the
current
people that
are out
there
are
Arthur
Mistral
and
Lil Jon
the rest
of the group
has not
has gone
back
inside
but
we don't
know what
the fuck's
going on
well you
guys do
hear through
the walls
this clockwork
mechanism
like you
guys can
totally hear
that
it's not
quiet
well I'm
going outside
then
check it
out
you guys
go on out
you see
the same
thing that
they see
you see
a doorway
where there
was a
wall
before
and you
also see
the
you see
light shimmering
up from
down below
what's in
there
I'm going
in
let's go
check it
in
all right
you head
down
as you go
down these
stairs like
they actually
widen out
into about
a 10 foot
wide
staircase
and you
go down
and you
go down
deep
we're talking
like
well not
super deep
but like
20-30 feet
down this
staircase
take a few
turns here
and there
as they try
and keep it
contained
as you
walk out
you see
a
a balcony
room
so there
is a
you're
walking
into
a stone
a stone
a stone
floor
room
that has
stairs that
go up to
a wooden
balcony
that surround
that room
do we all
have dark
vision or
do we need
the lights
oh no
there's
dancing
lights
you do
see a
number of
a number
of crates
trunks
an actual
of a pile
of gold
um and
a few
suits of
armor
that are
that are
screwed across
the floor
that's Kirk's
eyes go
wide at
piles of
gold
because he's
probably never
seen piles
of gold
well
pile
of gold
I have
20 silver
pieces to
my
it's
it's
my
it's my
life saving
you think
it's a
money fault
yeah
100%
I'm scooping
it up
I'm going to
see how
good it is
it goes
everything
over
you go
you go
for the
gold
you go
for the
armor
anybody else
I'm just
I'm going
to go
and just
look around
see if I
can find
anything
interesting
that I
think
that I
think
is
interesting
okay
so you
guys just
kind of
spread out
kind of
looking at
looking at
different
things in
there
um
when you
get to
the
when you
get to
the gold
you start
you
you start
scooping
it up
and as
you do
one of
the chests
that are
right next
to you
grows a
mouth
it has
teeth
I mean
I
said it
as you
approach
one of
the
one of
the
one of
the suits
of armor
it comes
to life
and
grabs a
sword
and
goes to
attack
everybody
let's have
some
initiative
what's
different
with it
thank you
voila
i could
do
uh
initiative
is just
dance
right
yeah
yeah
that's
not
good
what
do
that
what
what's
my
number
i can't
see
okay
plus
uh
plus
speed
plus
what
plus
your
interest
which
is
that's
where
i don't
see
it's
your
plus
two
at the
bottom
is
your
all
your
combat
stuff
oh
it's
on
the
bottom
of
that
somewhere
to
your
far
right
it's
or
to
your
far
left
uh
we're
a pile
of gold
oh
gold next
to a
chest
it's
gotta
be
there
yeah
probably
on the
pile of
gold
i mean
how big
could i
score
i wasn't
through the
waiting
mechanism
we have
the
surge
of
cohesion
you're
by an
armor
right
yeah
this one
or this
one
right
these are
two
markers
yeah
i'm gonna
take this
one
like i go
to this
one
all right
jessard what
do you got
uh i got
an 11
uh arthur what
did you get
a 20
um
it's
good
nine
nine
oh
apple
sold
started to
come out
oh yeah
for the
yd9
oh
i'm excited
uh
mistral
oh i'm
sorry
12
and
xander
also
12
all right
so
you
get a lot
point from
missing on
my own
issue
this
right
that is
the
mimic
that is
suit of
armor
that
is
a
rug
there
is a
hammer
that comes
to life
as well
um
we're just
straight up
in fantasia
now
i'm getting
out and we
freaked me the
hell out
when i was a
kid
where
i don't
know if i
didn't
understand if
i watched
it now
yeah right
okay so
real high
first up we
have
the
armor
the
animated
armor
oh
um
it is
going to
it's not
going to
move it's
just going to
go out and
attack
um
arthur so
you're inspecting
the armor
going oh
this is nice
and then all
of a sudden
it just
punches you
and misses
both times
um so
you it
it basically
it slams
it hits
you but
it hits
you like
and it
ricochets off
of your
chain mail
so your
chain mail
just absorbs
it
as it
uh as
it attacks
you
okay
um next
up arthur
you're up
and that's
you
yeah
only flight
thing to
do
okay
okay
okay
what's
what's
do
okay
what is
um
ah
here
what does
channel of divinity
does again
um
that's
uh
that
the only
thing that
would be
useful to
you there
is
you would
use an
action
to make
your
weapon
um
magic
weapon
but
you
wouldn't
be able
to
attack
if
you
did
that
um
but like
basically
you can
make
your
weapon
glow
with
light
and then
add your
christian
fire
to your
attack
as well
oh yeah
in most
cases
if you're
looking to
figure out
what your
best
your best
thing to
do is
in most
cases
as a
paladin
hit it
with your
weapon
okay
yeah
i grab
my
hammer out
and
that's
right
so go
ahead and
roll
d20
11
plus
strength
plus
6
i want to
make sure
i did a
close
and 8
when i
wrote this
now
so it
will be
17
17
uh
you
uh
17
misses
an
AC
of
18
last
spot
years
yeah
if
somebody
happens to
have a
luck
point
though
oh
oh
i hit
could
spend it
and actually
hit
yeah
yeah
take that
luck
point
all right
go ahead
and roll
damage
okay
so it
is
1d8
plus
4
1d8
plus
oh jesus
e7
uh
you rolled
uh
yep
three
okay
do you
do you
seven points
damn
seven points
of damage
yeah
um
so you
definitely
do hit it
and you
put a dent
in the armor
but the
uh
but it
still is
uh
it's not
it's not
looking like
it's in
in
terrible
shape
and
um
good
next up
we have
the rug
oh
about to get
one pulled
just
smothered
or
choked
or
burnt
if you're
wearing a rug
and get burnt
it wasn't
me
all right
so the rug
is going to
move up to
you
and it's
going to
attempt to
as derrick
mentioned
smother you
well
what is the
proper thing
for rugs
to do
i've learned
anything
from a ladder
does
a
13
hit
uh
almost
certainly
not
no it
does not
okay
i'm
close
um
well
that's
all
it's
got
so
it
tries
to
envelop
you
and
you
are
able
to
um
push
it
away
before
it
gets
get
anything
on
on
you
okay
all right
now we
have a
floating
hammer
hammer
hammer
stop
these are not
the hammer
yeah it's
gonna go in
there
okay
um so it's
going to
attack
uh so
a hammer
floats off
of the
table and
then comes
to
smash you
um
arthur
okay
the 23
hit
yes
imagine
um with
that you
take
um
you take
five points
of
dashing
damage
or
bludgeoning
damage
bludgeoning
damage
yeah
okay
five points
of smacking
damage
five points
of
bludgeoning
damage
and then
clawing the
hammer can do
that's your
seed when you're
slashing maybe
yeah
yeah
yeah
and that's
and that is
that is its
turn so
next is
mistro
mistro
has disappeared
poof
it's a mystery
succeeds at
stealth
um
well
looks like we've
got like
three other
people so
we'll just
throw him in
after
after that
so we'll move
on to
xander
sure
and then
when jason
gets back
we'll have
him
play it
at the start
all right
sick
uh we're
gonna give
my new
sunglass
feature
uh step
one
as a bonus
action
uh we're
gonna command
those four
dancing lights
that i have
about
which are
i guess i
didn't really
explain it
but for
anyone unfamiliar
they're like
kind of like
small just
floaty like
globes of
light
they're not
super bright
they shed
light about
10 feet
around them
and they
just kind
of float
around
i'm gonna
command them
as a bonus
action
as a bonus
action i can
move them up
to 60 feet
as long as
none of them
are outside
of 20 feet
of another one
so they have
to form like
a 20 foot
chain
okay
i'm gonna put
one exactly
here
here
here
and here
yeah
probably
like something
bust is gonna
happen
yes
um and then
i'm going to
channel divinity
searing radiance
um
what you want
to do
so the the
like kind of
small light
that's glowing
out of these
things just
brightens and
i picture it
like for this
guy especially
like being all
sea themed
as it almost
looks like a
white house
kind of effect
like sweeping
around um
and when it
hits uh
you guys
nothing happens
because it only
does anything
to uh
harmful things
um
uh
what hits them
however it
seems to
burn them
um everything
uh all four of
those things need
to make constitution
saves
we make all
kinds of
rolls
other concepts
the monsters
are pretty good
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
you can't
remember
the bonus
actions
or do you
baby
i don't know
no it was an
action to do
the channel divinity
the bonus
actions move
them around
but still
that's kind
of stupid
good
that doesn't
like to consume
them or anything
no
well it's
better
it theoretically
does that on
any white i've
created on the
plane of existence
so there was a
light spell like
somewhere else
my getting angry
doesn't seem to be
the same thing
it's kind of dumb
pretty good
it's pretty
pretty good
especially when you
roll relatively well
and what's the
dc again
oh my save dc
good question
sir i probably
written that down
somewhere 14
thank you
well
none of them
made it
and so
that's unfortunate
for them
now they all
suffer
21 points
of
team christ
which he
did
i imagine
fire damage
but i'll
double check
realize that
this guy
like
just hit him
with zeus
lightning bolt
but that wasn't
enough
you wanted to
do four
lightning bolts
to make sure
that you really
got the message
to go
himself
fuck
what
what
does
terminate
or terminate
that's
right
he's like
why
don't
open the
can
84 points
and david
with a
hand trip
level 3
it's my channel
divinity
yeah
i can only do
that once
per rest
yeah once
for long
rest
no no
for rest
oh per
rest
sorry
so once
for combat
effectively
god
all right
yep
everything
loaded
but that
does
that does
require a
a setup
though
for
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
so
all right
so
the hammer
got
steered
with
light
no longer
moving
everything
else
gets
gets
seared
pretty
well
however
there's
still
a lot
yeah
yeah
yeah
oh
all right
you're up
jason
let's see
if you
i'm sorry
i don't
even know
okay
what i'm
after
at this
point
this is
a suit
of armor
this is
a rug
and this
is a
treasure chest
all attacking
people
so
take your
pick i guess
yes
treasure chest
that happens
to have
teeth
i think
this is
actually the
first time
i've ever
fought
a mimic
in dmd
when it's
not dmd
anymore
yeah
yeah
i determined
if i'm doing
low level
if i'm doing
low level
dmd like
stuff and i
have the
option to
throw a mimic
at people
i'm gonna do it
yeah
no 100%
do it
until people
start getting
paranoid about
mimics
each square
is what
five feet
as a monk
you should
probably be able
to get almost
anywhere
damn
so
we're gonna
head over
here
for the
treasure
treasure
treasure
treasure
yeah
um
we all
i was saying
go 40
oh yeah
yeah
there's a
tax
of opportunity
you do get
you do get
attacked by
the rug
as you
pass it
how many feet
of movement
40
he could move
this way
and dodge
it
okay
well there
you go
we probably
would do
the
do the
walk
run past
the right
yeah
okay
so you
you get
over there
you're attacking
this
treasure
chest
yeah
i'm gonna
uh
yeah i'm gonna
take a swing
at it
with my
port
uh
i'm assuming
it's
wood
uh
it
moves
to me
um
yeah
i'm gonna
see if i can
do some
damage
with the
quarter
staff
okay
uh
which is
gonna be
what a
d20
yep
roll d20
to hit
and then
14
your
quarter
staff should
be in the
bottom there
there's a
attack
bonus
the
bottom
left
hand
side
where
your
weapons
are
probably
plus
six
would be
my guess
yes
if you've
got an
unarmed
strike on
there then
it would be
the same
oh
yep
uh
bonus of
five
okay
19
19
19
does
hit
an ac
of
12
uh
so go
ahead and
uh
on your
quarter
staff
i think
it does
it
d4
plus
three
no
that's
your
unarmory
oh
that's
gonna be
d6
probably
yeah
so
roll
d6
uh
it's
d20
don't
don't
confuse
the
four
yeah
four
yeah
okay
so that's
seven
yes
okay
so you
whack it
with uh
with your
quarter
staff
um
you do
have a bonus
action
you could
choose
to spend
a key
point
or a
technique
point
to uh
flurry of
blows
if you
wanted to
it would
be a
moral
technique
and that
would be
two
unarmed
attacks
yeah
yeah
let's go
for it
something
else
so
to do
that
i would
roll
the
20
again
or that's
when i
do
the
d4
i mean
we are
we're
probably
not
gonna
get
you
roll
the
d20
and then
when you
do
damage
you
roll
your
d4
first
one's
gonna
miss
so
you
can
do
yours
on
red
eight
plus
three
yes
okay
um
and
eleven
is
going
to
miss
right
you
did
miss
once
so
you
have
a
luck
point
right
and you
have
an
eleven
and a
twelve
is what
you're
looking
for
to hit
so if
you did
want to
use your
luck
point
you
and
you
do
hit
so
roll
d4
and
add
three
to
it
well
I
at least
could
have to
pick up
right
so you
do
five
points
of
damage
so
you
hit it
with
your
core
staff
and
then
do
a
windmill
kick
mess
with
one
and
then
use
the
momentum
to
take
over
the
other
boy
your
life
is
the
worst
it's
just
being
miserable
have you
had that
yogi's
pizza
by chance
random
question
today
never
even
heard
of
you
that's
the
pizza
the
pizza
really
oh
it's
probably
bad
same
building
as
the
happy's
all right
so
jazz
is
going to
break
away
from
inspecting
this
lighting
apparatus
around
see that
the
furniture
has
come
to
kill
us
let's
suspiciously
look at
the
light
so
he's
gonna
pull out
his
crossbow
and
it
lights
up
on fire
and I
take
aim
at
the
carpet
yeah
very
dull
and I'm
going to
shoot
at
said
carpet
we
hit
that's
gonna
be
a
26
that
does
hit
me
in
the
class
of
12
oh
yeah
well
I take
six points
of fire
damage
did you
miss fire
and
it
takes
this was
a seven
and a
one
so
eight
do I
add
my
oh
that's
that's
on
attack
so
it's
not
so
I
don't
you
don't
take
six
points
of
fire
damage
so
you
just
roll
the
extra
d6
of
fire
okay
and
cool
yeah
so
the
eight
of
the
weapon
right
uh
1d10
fire
1d6
fire
damage
so
you see
when you
roll a
20
you do
one
fire
damage
when you
roll
one
you take
1d6
fire
damage
so
you roll
the
regular weapon
damage
of
d8
plus
your
d6
fire
damage
right
correct
sorry
not a
problem
so
that is
going to
be
six
do I
add
my
score
yes
so
ten
because
of
my
feature
artificers
intuition
I can
add
my
intellect
instead
right
that is
ten points
of fire
ten points
of fire
damage
very nice
oh we forgot
Jason probably
had advantage
of all the
packs that he
made
oh you're
right
um
Jason
roll
two more
d20s
I mean
it might
might give
you an
extra
maybe
you quit
fifteen
or maybe
you didn't
have to
spend
one
oh yeah
yeah
well he
earns a
luck
with the
first
one
so
the first
one would
hit
no
no
difference
there's a
second
one
the second
one
hits
so roll
another d4
and add
seven
or add
three
yep
yep
yep
thank you
for
I just
thought
as it
was coming
up to
my turn
I'm like
I don't
have
if I
have
advantage
he did
too
right
it's five
again
yep
all right
as of right
now I have
nothing else
to do
so I'm
going to
be done
okay
I'm gonna
move away
from this
suspicious
light a little
bit
fair enough
all right
next up
is low
down
little
chan
is glad
to have
his glasses
on
he's like
he's enjoying
the disco
theater
right
he's gonna
stay where
he is
and he's
gonna pull
out his
longbow
and see
if he
can hit
a pin
shot
at the
suit of
armor
okay
and
do that
he needs
some dice
in his
hand
which would
be the
d20
is what
you're
rolling
and the
way that
pin
shot
works
it's
actually
a little
bit
different
than
two
on the
regular
attack
okay
can I
spark
yes
spark
for you
so
the
this is
one of
the things
that is
different
between
tales of
the
value
and
d&d
your
weapons
have
weapon
attributes
those
weapon
attributes
do
things
usually
they do
things
in lieu
of
damage
right
but
they are
like if
you've got
multiple
attacks
you can
just use
one of
your
attacks
to do
that
so
pinning
shot is
make an
attack
roll
with
what
this
weapon
against
a
large
yeah
make an
attack
roll
against
a
large
or
smaller
creature
from which
it is
on hit
the target
and succeed
a strength
or dexterity
save
target's
choice
or its
speed becomes
zero feet
until the end
of the next
turn
creature
including
the target
can use
its action
to
read the
target
okay
so you
are basically
gonna make it
so it can't
move
also
sorry
new system
with
plus one
weapons
does that
also get
added
to damage
to damage
yes
okay
add two
more
okay
carbidius
yeah
thank you
all right
so
the
he fails
and saves
so
the
the armor
basically just
kind of
it's
stuck
you can't
move
as long as
you're still
next to
it can still
attack you
though
so
um
but it
won't be
able to
won't be
able to
move
any
soon
um
all right
so that's
your attack
uh you do
have a bonus
action that
you can
spend
which
i think
for you
at this
point
you've
got
um
yeah
so
uh yeah
so
the pinning
shot
the pinning
shot will
only
will only
freeze the
armor and
won't
actually do
any damage
so if
you want
to have
done
damage
then
you know
we can
switch it
out the
other way
um
but
i roll a
two right
so that's
not gonna damage
anybody right
um
oh you
rolled a
two to
hit
yeah
so it's
not
yeah it's
not pinned
you missed
all right
um
you can
hit the
point
you do
get
luck
points
so
there you
go
uh you
do still
have bonus
action that
you can
spend to
either aim
or scurry
which is
move
um or
you could
use your
killer's
instinct to
determine
vulnerabilities
needs
so
uh
so aiming
will make
it so
your next
shot
you're gonna
be you
you'll have
a better
you'll you'll
be more
likely to
hit it
gives you
okay
um the
scurry
allows you
to move
but you
can move
already you
don't have
you haven't
spent any
movement at
this point
or you
could stay
where you
are
um and
the killer's
instinct allows
you to
basically look
at any one
of these
things in
here that's
moving and
determine if
if any of
them have
any weaknesses
at all
and you
just get
it it's
not a
role you
just know
whether or
not something
has vulnerability
all right so
i probably do
want to use
that killer
instinct
not a bad
idea sure
um all
right okay
so you want
to use it
um we'll
say you're
probably gonna
be focusing
more on
them on
the mimic
than anything
else i would
think unless
you want to
use it against
the armor or
the or the
bug but
okay um so
you know
that the
this mimic
is immune
to acid
and it's
and it is
immune to
being prone
so it can't
knock it
over
you know
it's got
dark vision
you know
it's
worst save
is its
charisma
save
that tracks
um no
it's worst save
is its
intelligence
it's second
worst is its
charisma
that also
tracks
um it's
a uh
it's like
you
it's
it runs
on
severe
instinct
it also
has the
ability to
if it
hits
anything
basically
gravel it
and
pull it
in
and
and
eat it
because that's
basically what
it does
it's it's a
walking it's a
walking stone
with teeth
um and
yeah that's
what you
know
all right
um
right so
there we go
uh next
up
is the
mimic
going to
do its
thing
uh
all right so
it is going
to uh
make two
pseudopod
attacks
against
um
i guess the
thing that it
was trying to
eat because it
was trying to
eat it
yeah but
to me
nothing has
changed in
its mind
or yeah
it's it's
it's not the
smartest thing
in the world
it's like this
is what
it's gonna
do
all right
um
does a
does a
13 hit
negative
okay
it does hit
you once
um
because i'm
pretty sure
24 would
hit
nope
and
in certain
systems it
might even
be a crit
no not
crit
um and
you take
10 points
of damage
from the
pseudopod
what type
of damage
um it
is bludgeoning
game
i'm not
reading anyway
so doesn't
matter
yeah
yeah
um
and
um
oh wait
that was
the wrong
or it
sure
my max
is still
31
courage
is
less
okay
um
how
and
guys
the trigger
just
just
bit
me
yeah
disco
lights
in a
bite
all right
touch it
we're just
taking the
gold
and the
and the
pseudopod
actually just
adheres to
you
um
and you're
trying to get
it on
on me
right
not quite
there yet
um
all right
you
oh
oh
yeah
skirk
you're
skirk
kind of
panicked
pulls out
his
flail
pointing
back
isn't that
it
i don't like
next picture
you run
in circles
yeah
pretty much
kidding me
i would like
a luck
point
please
no
i rolled
a one
and a three
oh
jeez
i mean
it's hard
to swing
when you're
off balance
i suppose
cow
well
fun turn
just action
dude
i'm not
gonna rage
because
yeah
yeah
all right
so the
animated armor
is still
going
is going
to continue
its
attacks
on
arthur
so it's
basically
doing like
haymakers
and stuff
on you
not in
stuff
it's
it's
doing
haymakers
it's
taking
two
swings
and
does
a
15
hit
no
it
does not
well then
it continues
to miss
you
as it
does
so it's
it's
box
it's
doing
it's
best to
box
but
it ain't
boxing
still
great
um
arthur
you're
up
okay
for sure
yeah
is it
bane
guy
is this a
targeting spell
yes you have to target
up to three creatures
and all three of those creatures
then have to roll
a d4
on all of their
attacks
um
and subtract
the d4
from their
attack
okay
so
again i don't
look i was looking at
something to help
with the chest
because that chest
is
it has weakness
to uh
charisma to save
so i thought
uh well yeah
you can you can
totally do that
yeah
if you if you
wanted to
um
you are in
combat
with
the armor
with the armor
too so
um
if that's a
blue one
um
you won't be able
to attack
and do that
at the same time
so
you could do a
green one
and attack
but you wouldn't
be able to do
a blue
and attack
which is fine
if that's what
you want
no
no
i'm gonna do that
okay
so you're gonna
cast bane
yeah i'm gonna
cast bane
okay
flip your
flip your
character sheet over
and mark off
one of your
level one
spells
yeah
um so
you cast
bane
and you
target
all three
of the
yeah
all three
all three
things
all three
of the
things
okay so
how do i do
this
i'm still
like
you just
yep he
you have
done this
yep we just
did it
there's no
you have to
look at your
at your
spellcasting
dc though
uh so your
spellcasting dc
is at the
bottom
on the
far right
there could be
a spellcasting
um
save
that's a
twelve
and my
yeah twelve
and my
attack
so
the rub
passes
nothing
let me
make
fiddles
and the
animated armor
fails
pretty good
so
we will
go ahead
and
baned
baned
yeah
i thought
i thought
that
i thought
that might
be helpful
for you
guys
oh yeah
absolutely
can i look
at that
it looks
pretty
good
uh
bonus
action
do you
want to
use
one
hmm
guard
guard
all right
cool
sounds good
uh next
up
we got
the rug
oh
so
first
so
what
do i
mark
off
so
you've
used
one of
your
three
so
however
you
want
to
get
there
that
you
only
have
two
left
uh
you
take
twelve
points
of
blood
here
oh
um
and you
are grappled
don't
like
any
of
that
okay
um
it
is a
and it
will
require
an
escape
roll
on
air
c13
yeah
yeah
about
that
cool
um
and then
it's
going to
use
its
bonus
action
to
rolling
charge
um
oh
no
sorry
it's
not
sitting
here
just
one
time
uh
it
wasn't
fine
okay
okay
thank you
yeah
it's
going
to
rolling
charge
um
i
think
um
oh
it's
grappling
creature
nevermind
it's not
going to
charge
it's not
going to
charge
it wants
to charge
with a
creature
oh
roll
them up
it would be
awesome
um
you're
you're
like
a
fruit
roll
up
all
right
we're
gonna
feed
you
to
the
minute
it's
a
xander
roll
up
instead
miss
roll
you're
up
all
right
uh
that
feather test
is still
going
right
oh
yeah
oh
yeah
and
i
have
disadvantages
now
i also
have
some
form of
disadvantage
with
let's
stick
with
my
quarter
staff
it did
me
good
last
yeah
like
i
don't
hit it
with the
pokey
end
oh
wait
the
blunt
end
one
of the
two
one
of
the
two
two
d20
because
you
have
advantage
still
yeah
yeah
oh
11
8
oh
let's
if i
get it
in the
8
so
we're
taking
the
11
right
yep
you got
4
5
16
yeah
it was
12
yeah
the AC
is 12
so
versus
hits
a roll
d6
add
3
to
that
so
7
7
points
of
animation
all right
do you want
to
flurry of
blows
yeah
why not
wait
that takes
a
technique
point
right
it does
take a
technique
point
but
at
like i
i'm
i'm
pretty
sure
that
this
is
different
than
dnd
but
technique
points
refresh
on a
short
rest
in this
game
instead of
a long
rest
pretty sure
the dnd
was long
rest
yeah we're
gonna do it
why not
let's try
and get
rid of
this
guy
fold
roll again
you have
advantage on
all your
attacks
so
that'll hit
four points
damage
yes sir
that i'm
referring for
form
and rolling
ones
and single
bit
all right
and you
have
one
attack
so
roll
10
20
takes
a
thing
of
gentile
three
yeah
12
i see
those
yeah
guys
that
that'll
be a
15 to
hit
so
that's
funny
i like
that more
than
the dice
jail
the dice
jail is
a tired
clean day
i'm good
at the twos
the dunks
can't
we're gonna
have five
on that one
you just gotta
get a 3d
printer and
you have
your own
all right
all right
so you
are beating
the living
crap out
of this
thing
um
you haven't
quite gotten
you haven't
quite gotten
it down
but it's
it's on
its last
breath
here
all right
so all
all that
you really
need is
skirt to
just blow
on it
and it'll
fall over
thanks
kick it
with your
good leg
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
oh
he doesn't
i know
he doesn't
you know
interesting
interesting
so that
thing's
almost dead
these other
two things
are the
rug
and a
way to
work
i am
grabbing
which is
largely fine
you don't
really want
to move
anyway so
yeah
it's fine
i mean you
might
just try to
decide
how much
of any
resources
to put
into this
this is the
carpet right
yeah
what's up
it does not
but it does
have a
another action
if it has
a grapple
by its
turn
it has a
suffocate
action
yep
yes
i saw the
rug of
smothering
for nothing
right
you've been
grumpled
so let's
start there
i'm gonna
cast sacred
flame on
it
lights up
and uh
this thing
is
well
celebrating
holy fire
and he's
making a
duck save
hopefully you're
better at it
than shadow
hard
right
six
save
14
okay
okay
do it
oh yeah
it's just an
animated object
well yeah
yeah
just a little
guy
they have
hit points
but that's
all they
got
uh
seven points
of radiant
damage
right
okay
spells are
OP
in this
the
cleric has
two different
kinds
you could be
like
melee cleric
or spellcaster
cleric
spellcaster
cleric
gets their
spellcasting
mod to
cantrip
bonus
to cantrip
damage
which is
really good
that's still
alive i assume
it is still
alive yeah
still animated
it was probably
never alive
well that's
likely true
yes
it's still
grumpling you
yeah it is
all right
well
cool
that's all
i got
okay
jesrik
all right
well
that's what
i want to
do
um
jesrik
is going
to
uh
aiming
is
not
nothing
all right
unless you
happen to be
a ranger
i am not
a ranger
so i am
just gonna
go ahead
and shoot
at one of
these things
and the
carpet is the
most flammable
thing in my
opinion
i mean
does that
that's
track
a lot of
cracks
also
so uh
so that is
gonna be
an 11
plus
punch
that's gonna
be a 19
to hit
19
little hits
and then
we're gonna
do some
damage to
it
yeah
uh we're
gonna do a lot
of damage to
it
yeah
uh so
that's gonna
be
uh
13
oh nope
more than
that sorry
uh
17
points of
damage
that's a
lot sir
how are you
gonna feel
killed it
as it's
as it's
going to
like smother
xander
uh i just
shoot like
it's just a
flaming arrow
straight through
it and it
like burns
away around
xander
then he
pops out
of the
cocoon
like a
phoenix
and as it's
roaming away
uh
jezra
can
see ya
okay
crazy guy
all right
little john
you're up
all right
well i'm
gonna shoot
the
take
pull out
my long
bow
and i'm
gonna aim
and shoot
this time
right
okay
there you
go uh
so i
already
had my
double
on first
attack
yeah
so
uh
double your
proficiency
bonus on
your first
attack
so it's
a
four
on top
of your
plus five
with your
long bow
so it's
a plus
nine to
hit
okay
no
then i
hit
twenty
plus
five
yeah you're
right
so it's
a plus
seven to
hit
sorry
yeah
yeah
roll
d20
yep
and add
seven to
that
five
whoa
plus
seven
is
twelve
twelve
and you're
shooting at
which thing
the
um
twelve
will not
hit an
ac of
eighteen
three to
reroll
three to
reroll
three to
reroll
which
next time
you'll be
able to do
that
like a
ball
see
yeah
all right
and um
battery
style
which
did you
compare
your
cap
no my
computer is
doing okay
all right
i'm i'm just
i'm just upset
that you haven't
been able to
hit this
entire
company
it's making
me mad
that's not
what i want
for my
players
um
all right
uh
he unleashed
a rain of
nuclear fire
light
right
of
damage
to all
four things
you're still
blinded a little
bit
from
all right
so now
it's the
mimic's
turn
uh
it is
going
to
what does
bane do
in this
system
um
it
roll
you
thank you
for the
minus
it
is
my
old
key way
of making
sure you
didn't forget
that
i appreciate
that
but feel
free to
call me
out on
stuff
if i'm
missing
if i'm
missing
stuff
like
i'm
i'm
not gonna
i'm
not gonna
get upset
i'm
busy
trying to
keep track
of everything
uh
so it's
going to
probably
because it's
still latched
on to me
yep
it's still
gonna be
going for
you
um
and
it's
going to
get another
pseudopod
on you
and
sense
is a
tasty
stack
uh
nine
plus
five
all right
um
and then
it's
going to
attempt
to bite
you
and
that's
gonna
roll
one
so
yeah
good job
bane
would a
15
have
hit
you
no
um
all right
so
it's
it's
doing
its
it's
doing
its
darndest
but not
doing
darndest
enough
you're
up
play it
back
you can
we tried
this before
we'll hop
around a
little bit
and we're
gonna whack
at it
with the
flail
that'll
hit
it's
if it
was
if it
was a
hair's
breath
away
from
dead
it's
now
dead
because
i rolled
a
20
does it
double in
the system
or do i
roll the
die twice
um
it
uh
it's
roll the
die twice
11
plus
and i only
get my
bonus once
though right
or do i
get the
bonus twice
you only
get the
bonus once
okay so
16
16
points
damage
okay
how do
you kill
it
and
who did
12
points
of
over
damage
okay
with how
you decimated
i'm
swinging the
flail around
right
it's
got its
little
hinge
chest
mouth
open
thing
and it's
trying to
grab at
me
and i
hooked
the
i hook
it on
its
like on
the hinge
and yank
back
and it
like yanks
the lid
of the
thing
back
and
just
completely
blast
and
accidentally
falls
in
half
yeah
yeah
and all
kinds
of
yeah
yeah
blaze
out
everywhere
yeah
um
and we
have
one
very
dead
mimic
yeah
all right
um
and
that's
turn
yeah
all right
uh
no actually
i'm gonna
five ten
yeah
there's no
reason not
to
just in case
something
happens
awesome
okay
animated
armor
uh
is going
to
attack
nevermind
i'm gonna
move
here
yeah
it is
maimed
but
i can't
let's
see
here
that's
a
20
to
head
yeah
it's a
20
to
head
okay
what's
gonna
happen
what's
gonna
happen
we're
hoping
there's
actually
a
squirrel
or
something
because
husky
has a
new
thing
where
he
just
goes
to
the
corner
and
just
starts
this
kind
of
bark
that's
nervous
but not
nervous
and so
hopefully
there's
a
squirrel
or
raccoon
or
something
back
there
otherwise
he's
just
nuts
just
yelling
for
no
reason
that's
worse
yeah
okay
at least
you're
at least
you're
healthy
sassmouth
you
just
whines
at me
like
I could
deal
with
sassmouth
yeah
whining
is what
noise
well
secret
well
um
secret
weapon
that
is an
action
to make
your
to make
your
hammer
into a
lightsaber
but
we're at
the end
of the
combat
generally
you want
to use
that
at the
beginning
of the
combat
okay
that's
making
sure
okay
okay
you're
right now
the tactical
advantage
if you're
looking for
that
is
hit it
okay
it's the
last thing
in there
it's almost
dead
and you
have it
abandoned
and you
just hit it
yeah
yeah
i'm going
i'm going
i'm going
i'm going
bring up
my hammer
and smash
it down
okay
get him
roll
twice
and take
the
higher
of the
two
twelve
nine
and plus
six
is
okay
and
eighteen
eighteen
it's
only
just
that's what
you were
looking for
and
can you
donate
luck points
to other
people or
not
unfortunately
not
okay
and
it is a
personal
resource
okay
and
would be
cool though
okay
one
d
eight
eight
all right
um
you
do
kill it
so how
do you
want to
have
killed it
um
you did
do
five points
of over
damage
so
you only
just
killed it
but you
did
kill
it
it's
fair
i
i'm
basically
i basically
i basically
jumped
and slug
it down
on it
like
basically
shrink
to the
armors
all right
you crush
the helmets
and the
armor itself
falls to the
ground
motionless
yeah
reach
all right
and that
is the
combat
yeah
it's
the
armor
still usable
go straight
back
back
to
the
money
100%
can
the
armor
fit me
or no
well
let me tell
you what
you get
and we'll
see
tell him
what he
won
this is
this is a
combat
in a
treasure
in a
treasure
room
so
chances
of
you
walked
away
with
some
treasure
or
some
treasure
so
let's
talk
gold
first
everybody
gets
500
gold
out of
the
sweet
jiminy
moses
so
3,000
gold
total
but
if you
divide
it out
it's
500
gold
and
250
times as
much money
as I've
ever had
in my
entire
life
where it
says
hey
you'd be
a
dock
worker
but
got
missed my
union
card
I was
a
dock
worker
yeah
the
skirk's
gonna
retire
and
there
are
a number
of
suits
of
armor
weaponry
different
things
in
here
that
are
of
okay
quality
but not
really
worth
your
time
there
are
some
things
there
that
are
worth
your
time
however
um
Arthur
you
find
uh
a
suit of
plate
armor
and a
plus one
warhammer
plus one
what
are you
there
um
Xander
you
find
a
sentinel
shield
and a
plus one
amulet
of the
devout
oh
mistral
you
find
a devout
amulet
that's
fine
um
mistral
you
find
some
thunder
fist
hand
wraps
um
little
john
there we
go
uh
you'll
find
some
braces
of
archery
oh
um
and
skirk
you'll
find
gold
lots
of
gold
um
and that's
and that's
what you're
able to
get from
the
treasury
okay
um
so
basically
for
those of
you
who don't
know
what these
things
do
um
the braces
of archery
um
ryan
will give
you plus
two damage
for anything
that you
shoot
so your
longbow
will be
adding a
plus two
on top of
that so
if you pull
if you go
the other
side where
you're
um
going around
sorry
he's not
sure
he was
um
so in
your
longbow
where it
says
plus
dex
um
i would
just change
the dex
to
um
three plus
two so
it's plus
five
uh
well not
the dex
uh
just the
just the
erase dex
and put
five in
there
because that's
what you
had
going
um
the plus
one
weapons
uh
which is
what both
of you
guys have
give you
a plus
one to
attack
and damage
so in
your
um
in your
unarmed
strike
jason
um
you would
have
your
attack
will be
one higher
so
update that
and
your damage
will be
one higher
so update
that
same thing
with you
ian
only in
your
warhammer
okay
my warhammer
gets seven
plus seven
now
yours
yeah
um
and ian
your ac
is now
20
plus
shields
with
the shield
that's
20
it's
18
18
base
20
with
the
shield
yeah
um
so jason
you also
with those
hand wraps
um you have
a few other
things that
happened
they they
do thunder
damage
so you
add one
d6 to
any unarmed
strike you
have so it's
your d4
plus a d6
oh okay
that was
going to be
my question
um and
also
they have
a special
ability that
if you're
attacking
something that
is armored
it will
and you
hit
you reduce
their armor
value by
one
that's cool
um and
it doesn't
stack so
once you've
applied that
it's there
but you
basically make
it easier for
you to hit
and easier for
everybody else
because of
the thunderous
attack with
your food
okay that's
awesome
yeah that's
sick
so um
and ian you
just got
full plate armor
which in of
itself is
amazing
and a plus
one weapon
which in of
itself is
amazing
so that's
what you got
i figure i'd
keep it simple
give you things
that are for
sure going to
be good for
you
yeah
basically
it doesn't
even slow me
down because
my strength
is 18
right okay
so that's
what you're
able to find
here um
the you
you explore
the rest of
the area
um there
doesn't uh
there are
like this
apparently was
more than a
treasure room
it seems like
it was some
sort of like
back in the
day it was
some sort of
like hidden
hidden room
or hidden
social club
sort of thing
that the pirates
basically just
utilized or
um
for a treasure
room because
it was so
well concealed
um
but there
there doesn't
appear to be
anything else
of note
here um
and i feel
well actually
i apologize
misral
you find
a piece
of a treasure
map that
appears to
manage
that partial
treasure map
that you have
that's
specifically here
okay
um
it and
that piece
of that
treasure map
does
you do
in your
thieves can
it does
start talking
about the
pearls
location
okay
which does
appear to
be
south
all right
so that's
where we
are
you guys
made it
through
made it
through the
the night
yes
before we
bed down
to rest
for the
night
right
mm-hmm
go up
to skirt
baby
skirt
let me see
her
anchor
yes
i'll sit
down and
i'll take
one of my
last remaining
motes and
like infuse
it into
the anchor
it is a
plus one
anchor
okay
that's sick
that's permanent
until i take
it back
yeah yeah
i will take
an hour to
do that
sick
right
also
i'll
does it
like glow
or weird
shit
uh it's
just like
little like
line on
it
yeah
it looks
it looks
fancier
nice
place theme
music for
you
nice
i hope
it does
it's
it's got
it's got
entry music
just like
yes
yeah
yes
um
but it's
extra gears
on it that
don't do
anything
but if you
believe hard
enough
they'll make
you go
faster
so you
guys
you guys
bed down
for the
night
um
whoever's
running
watches
um
the night
it doesn't
go by
quietly
but you
don't have
anything that
specifically
comes
um
comes a
calling
right
um
you do
see more
of those
creatures
more of
the
atmosphere
so the
fog itself
appears to
have a
appears to
have a uh
a mind of
its own
like as
you as
you're looking
out across
the landscape
you'll see
like one
creature walking
around and
then the
fog itself
just envelops
it and
then disappears
and that
creature's
no more
um just
kind of
like some
really weird
stuff
the most
people
it
don't go
out on
this
if you
if you
do
remember
the uh
the um
the gatekeeper
specifically told
you that if
though if the
mist changes
directions
run
oh
um
now you
kind of have
a little
better of an
idea about
what you
meant
um
who is
taking last
watch
that's not
a Gordon
question at
all
first and
last
war
you can't
take all
the watches
no i
take first
and last
you can't
take all
the watches
you take
one
one two
three
i only
need for
half as
much sleep
as a
normal person
so i'm
definitely
taking a
watch
that the
way that
the way
that watches
make
i'll take
one
you take
you take
one
and you
sleep
i have
dark
versions
so i'll
take one
that'll
make that
easy
you can't
hog all
the watches
leave some
watches for
other people
i'll take
first
i'll take
first
okay
um
okay
so
whoever's
last watch
uh
yeah
sure
we all
signed up
so
whatever
yeah
you're
basically
you you
basically
have like
a rose
nest
sort of
situation
in this
tavern
so you're
um
you found
uh
you guys
found a
way of
being able
to get
up to
the
get up
to the
roof
and be
able to
kind of
get a
better
vantage
point
um
and at
the
beginning
of like
just as
dawn is
breaking
um
to the
south
um
not far
probably
about
maybe a
mile
maybe a
mile
um
might even
be closer
you see
this
you hear
a loud
crack of
thunder
and you
see a
bright
light
emanate
from the
ground
um
and it
pulses
and then
it just
kind of
condenses
and you
see that
it's still
there but
it's just
not as
big as
it was
before
um
and
then you
know you
hear kind
of some
monstrous
cries from
everywhere
you're not
really sure
what what
just happened
um
everybody
who's
everybody
i need
you to
make
a
ten
a
dc
ten
con
save
except for
jazrek
who i
need to
make a
dc
eleven
con
save
because i
just made
yep
because i
had
proficiency
i got
to add
your
con
which
is
three
cost
two
con
save
so you
go that
to ten
you hit
the target
number
you go
yeah i
have six
what die
did you
say
the d20
oh yeah
so
seventeen
yeah that
looks like
i'll hit a
ten
ian what
you got
i got
six
you rolled
a six
you rolled
a four
okay
okay
awesome
should have
taken all
those
watches
good
sleep
i always
say
keep the
mind
healthy
okay
that's
good
to
look so
healthy
i don't
like
i don't
like
the
lips
of
that
a few
hundred
years
all right
um so
again this
is kind of
one of those
things you
feel you
you feel
that you
you you
you see
the light
you see
the uh
you see
the disruption
and there
appears to be
something that's
happening
that is
seems like it
might be
out of
character
based off of
the reaction
of the actual
ward itself
um
reader
and everybody
go ahead
and roll
a roll
a dc
ten
perception
check
with
advantage
anybody
who
makes
that
check
is
working
up
five
oh
that's
a d12
one
ball
that one
do i have
d12
yeah the d12
and the d20
are really
similar
like i i had
a the hardest
time telling them
the part when i
was i still not i
still make the
mistakes sometimes
like wait a minute
yep
all right
okay i will
seven so not
now the first one
right plus your
perception
plus your perception
skill which is
which is right
there plus two
so 11 will hit
team
oh right there
yeah as long as you
rolled above a 10
then you
woke up
so you know what you
know everybody else i
think everybody else
passed the past the
thing you're white you're
woken up by this big
loud crack
um what do you do
i i said
what the
i'm standing up
for attention
that question is
directed at the
person who was
watching
i'm i'm running
downstairs
to kind of
well i'm gonna say
i wasn't for sure
that it woke
everybody
uh so my
original intention
is going to be to
kind of take a look
outside and see
what's going on
around the pub
um it seems how i
did hear kind of
the the whines and
moans and groans of
the monsters just to
see if there's
anything
nearby uh get
downstairs notice
everybody's awake so
i kind of fill them
in on
what i seen what i
noticed
and
it's still dark
um it's a naked
if it's a naked
art person here i'm
getting the hell out
of here
i forget right
hey don't
terminate her
up in here
yeah it's
done
okay
like that
like
yeah
yeah
okay
yeah
okay
yeah
okay
all right just
this is when
this happens
so dawn has
come
yeah
just like
um
uh before we
do much of
anything else
i'm gonna take
this opportunity
while we
rested to
spend some
hit die
to recover
hit points
that is a
good note
thank you
yes
you definitely
took a short
rest
yes
so yeah
so one hit
die
probably
yeah and
this is
this is
something that
um
the old
hats
in dnd
this is
different with
me in short
rest
if you if
you just
take 10
minutes you
can take
a short
rest i'm
not like
you just
you can take
short rests
like that
i don't i
don't want you
guys to have
to be like
well was it
really an
hour you
know it's
just like
and so
wait
how much
health do
you have
you barely
got hit
right
shoot i
have three
actually
no
no
no i
i i
at 32
i got
hit
twice
i i took
five
originally
and took
me down
to
i mean
you can't
you can't
send it
it's just
kind of like
you only
have so
many
hit
does
you can't
just
yeah
yeah
unless you
are missing
at least
as much
as
your
hit
die
is
it's
probably
not
worth
using
one
yep
agreed
yeah
i was
at
half
you guys
let
cherries
that
pop is
the worst
tasting substance
it is
dave has the same
opinion
you're both
crazy
what's that
so good
that this is
gross
oh it's
disgusting
you're a
vile creature
for even
she's like
it's so good
i was so
excited when
it was on
the shelf
i went
back
for all
that i
could get
it's
the most
awful
drinkable
drink
drink it
but not
over water
if you were
dying on a
desert island
i had
the worst
cotton mouth
out
and there
was no
water
and someone
said hey
spiced
cranberry
spray
i'd be
like
sure
i'll
die
thanks
i'm
on
team
ramsay
for this
nope
i'm
unfazed
um
okay
so you
you've run
down
you guys
just woke
up
we'll let
you know
that there's
some sort
of bad
mojo
happening
to the
south
what do you
guys do
i think it's
time to go
south
i get my
uh
flail
and we're
going
right
i'm not
your compass
your compass
is still
pointing south
i'm out
the door
all right
all right
all the
last point
so before
we leave
i am going
to wait
for that
uh
fold
my shield
contraption
so it's
small enough
that i can
carry
okay
sounds good
you throw
it people
sick
i try
and they
go fly
another 20
feet
i don't
know
all right
you guys
move down
you guys
move down
navigating
through the
the streets
as best
you can
um you
have a few
short you
have a few
close calls
where there's
some sort of
monster that
is about to
pop out but
you just kind
of hold off
because you
know you
could kill
the monster
but you
know there's
something a
little bit more
pressing at
play um as
you get closer
to the location
that mistral
saw um you
see a courtyard
that's kind of
opening up and
you see um
three figures
that are standing
around what looks
to be a crystal
ball um that
is set up on
a makeshift
pedestal um
so there's one
figure that is
there's one
figure that is
pointing at
the um
there's one
figure that is
working with
the working with
the crystal ball
like infusing it
with magic if
you look at the
crystal ball it
looks like there's
kind of like a
thunderstorm on a
sea that is
inside it um and
as this person is
pouring magic into
it it becomes
more and more
violent
that seems bad
um seems scary
i don't like it
the um the
other two um
one is a
heavily armored
um a heavily
armored creature
that looks um
that looks very um
looks like he's on
guard on watch so
he hasn't seen you
guys yet but it's
definitely one of
those things where
he's keeping a
eye out for what's
happening um and
then the third one
is kind of like
little paying
paying attention to
the pedestal a
little bit but also
keeping watch um
and that one
appears to be more
appears to be in
like um
you know caster
government and that
kind of thing
so it looks more
like it's a
spellcaster
um as far as
their appearance
is considered
they are
rather um
rather
i guess
is the best way
to put it
uh the creature
that is
the creature
that is
in front of
the um
in front of
the crystal ball
um
has
there's
like
flaming
aura
that he has
around him
he's
he's wearing
horns he looks
like he might
have been or
not wearing
horns he has
horns he looks
like he might
have been
some other
type of creature
in the past
but something has
changed him
and morphed him
into me
that's a little
more evil
and more
sinister
yeah
um
the
the one
that's kind
of keeping
it's
um
keeping it's
uh
kind of
in the
in the
middle
point
um
it
it
again
it look
it has
that sort
of like
morphed
appearance
um
this looks
like
looks more
like it
used to be
um
a human
of some
kind
but you
do see
like the
wisp of a
flaming pale
and you
know
different things
that are
out and about
with it
um
again
it just
kind of
looks like
there's
something
that's
changed
it
um
and you're
going to
see a
similar
thing
with
the
heavily
armored
creature
as well
um
this one
again
looks more
sinister
um
it has
more of
like
more of
like
a
military
sort
of
um
poise
about
it
um
very
very
well
trained
and
again
it's
got that
like
flame
demonic
horn
sort
of
stuff
going
oh
well
question
can I
use
divine
sense
you
can
use
divine
sense
this
is
this
would
be
yeah
this
would
be
a
prime
opportunity
yes
I'm
done
using
divine
sense
to see
if this
is our
target
all right
so you
use
divine
sense
you don't
have to
roll
anything
it just
happens
mark
one usage
of your
divine
sense
though
okay
so find
your divine
sense
card
and put
a one
on it
okay
divine
sense
so what
you are
able to
determine
is these
creatures
while they
are not
demons
themselves
they
definitely
have
a
demonic
influence
about
them
so
they're
they're
unholy
creatures
come on
excellent
tell
no
your
husband
friend
is
not
amongst
these
like
okay
yeah
all right
if that's
what you
were
fishing
for
he is
not
that
okay
so
you guys
are kind
of just
taking in
your
taking in
your
done
something
has
happened
what you
do
teamwork
teamwork
small
folk
teamwork
right
all right
i have
unfolded
my trap
and handed
it to
jerk
and he has
thrown it at
them
the intent
being
we'll know
if they're
monsters
if they
trigger the
trap
hey
wrong
that logic
is
impoppable
simple
kids
simple
kids
okay
okay
i'm
going to
need
a
rage
attack
roll
from
from
from
the
barbarian
perhaps
be a
strife
based
range
he's
tossing
this
thing
well
whatever
a
thrown
weapon
would
be
i don't
know
probably
dex
probably
dex
would
be
my
guess
power
tilted
i thought
would be
okay
i'm not
going to
turn it
past
it
doesn't
hit
anything
it's
close
enough
maybe
efficiency
but if
you don't
get it
close
enough
they also
might not
hear it
hit
which means
they might
pretty big
nevermind
okay so
seven
yep
um
well
i might
be able
to fix
this
convince
you
of an
athletics
trick
depending
on what
are you
trying to
hit them
with it
because if
you're trying
to hit
them with
it
i'm
i'm
gonna
with
the
yeah
we're
trying to
hit
them
with
it
because
we're
trying
to
trigger
the
if
you're
trying
to
get
it
close
to
them
i
i
could
see
athletic
no
we're
trying
to
hit
them
with
trying
to
hit
them
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
there's
no
joke
in
there
just
skirt
smash
yeah
okay
that's
okay
what's
i should
have
raged
i should
have
been
mad
fast
yeah
almost
assuredly
we should
have
done
yeah
yeah
100%
what should
have
happened
i'm
pretty
sure
that
you
can
recklessly
attack
even
without
aim rate
i thought
i had
pretty sure
you can
i think
chris is
right
i don't
chris is
right
with dmv
anyway
and i'm
i'm 90%
that this
is gonna
well
in that case
i would
have
recklessly
done
well
then
recklessly
attack
throw
another
one
figure
out
whether
the
rules
are
in
this
later
that's
going
to be
16
nice
better
quite
better
okay
yep
you can
just
attack
right
so
unfortunately
you do
not
hit
well
you do
hit
the
knight
it does
not
it's not
a monster
breaker
not a monster
it's not a
monster
and it all
falls to the
ground
as you
do that
the ritual
itself
finishes
you guys
are coming
from here
well
that's awkward
we have
thrown the
thing
yep
that's
clearly
we were
definitely
up front
yep
yep
where are we
at
somewhere in the
back
please
you can
toss me in
that
anywhere
out
here
fireball
get him
lightning ball
all
things
go like
the purple
a is
the knight
the green
one is
the
is the
uh
uh
spellcaster
kill that one
and the
spellcaster that
was in
that is in
here
is
there
and that
yellow
a
is
the actual
crystal ball
itself
when the
ritual
takes effect
the
um
yeah
uh
when the
ritual
takes effect
um
the
the
ring
that's
surrounded
there
is
uh
basically
gets filled
with violent
winds
um
the storm
inside the
crystal ball
starts pulsing
and the
crystal ball
itself
starts pulsing
with light
um
the
first
uh
the
spellcaster
that's
inside
there
dies a
horrible
death
doesn't
die a
horrible
death
but
does
take
um
wait
why am I
doing
here we
um
does
take
five
points
of
slashing
damage
um
due to
the
winds
themselves
taking
place
um
so
in
in
lieu of
this
not being
a video
game
I'm
going to
explain
some
rules
of
combat
so that
you don't
think it's
one way
and then
end up
failing
so
this
um
the
the
object
of
this
combat
is to
destroy
that
crystal
ball
and
potentially
take care
of these
guys if
they if
they don't
run
the crystal
ball itself
is attracting
creatures
to this
specific
place
creatures from
the south
which is
this
situation
um
don't like
that
what those
creatures are
i'm going
to wait
to reveal
but
every round
that that
crystal ball
is not
destroyed
the amount
of those
creatures
that are
going to
be coming
into this
area
is going
to double
okay
so we're
going to
start off
with one
after the
initial round
yeah
it's going
to be two
then it's
going to be
four
then it's
going to
be eight
then we're
going to
die
there's
if we
get 128
things have
gone wrong
right
so you've
gone terribly
um
also
when you
enter into
this specific
area
um
any turn
that you
start inside
that area
or anytime
you enter
into that
area
you take
1d10
slashing
damage
okay
um
and
yeah
um
and i
think
that's
that's
pretty
that's
pretty
much
all the
there
there are
a few
other
things
that will
pop up
as as
part of
the combat
itself
um
but these
are the
main
mechanics
of what's
happening
here
okay
so
couple
questions
yes
is this
a wall
or is this
a dome
it's a
dome
got it
can we
see through
it
you can
okay
yeah
it's
winds
correct
these
are
violent
winds
yeah
um
violent
magical
winds
yes
yes
all right
can I shoot
through these
things
i don't know
right
it's a
question
that
that
that is
that may be
one of the
mechanics that i
was referring to
probably make
shooting harder
well
at least
sure
all righty
uh
cool
cool
where's the
track
that was
yeah
that was
oh yeah
yeah
yeah
because it
didn't go
off
we'll say
it
it landed
we'll use
it
we'll use
it
say it
landed
right
like you
were really
close
it landed
right there
all right
and it
bounced off
his arm
ring
landed
right over
there
all right
all right
so let's
roll some
initiative
that's some
pretty good
initiative
i did exactly
what you did
dave
yeah
i had
advantage on
that roll
uh-huh
a one and a
three
two
three
initiative
that's
essential
with you
that's
it's real
good
it's real
good
if i don't
roll one
of the three
kill
all right
one
sympathizes
all right
skirk
what are we
at 15
can we add
our initiative
to that
roll
all right
all right
well that
helps a
little bit
roll
the one
ah
yeah
xander
five
miss
roll
nine
you rolled
a one
and you
had a
nine
yeah my
initiative
is eight
right i go
off of this
one
yeah
that's
really good
oh yeah
yes
oh yeah
muck
muck
do
muck
do what
muck
does
um
ian
which
kill
mine
mine
was
a
12
okay
um
little
john
14
14
all right
and
jess
19
i'm gonna
say
i'm going
first out
of 15
all right
let's
start us
off here
okay
jess
you are
first
all right
uh
well
no time
to find
out like
the present
i'm gonna
say
nope
monsters
okay
yeah
i'm gonna
take aim
and i see
that they're
messing with the
crystal ball
back there
i'm gonna try
to take aim
and i'm gonna
try to shoot
the crystal ball
all right
we are certainly
gonna try
go ahead and
roll an attack
um it's
you're you're
looking for
a um
you're looking
for a 25
to hit
okay
well
so
i do not
hit a 25
okay
i miss
so um but
that for
ranged attacks
to get to
it your
your
dc is 25
so um
it'll be
really
it does have
a switch
if you do
if you do
roll a 20
there's always
a chance
like if you
roll a 20
you will get
through
but that's
about the only
way that you're
going to be
able to get
through if
you can't
hit a 25
with your
with your
roll
17
it's not
great
but
okay
uh do you
have anything
else
um i just
have some
movement
um and
i'm gonna
actually
move
uh
5
and
15
20
20
right into
there
okay
peek around
duck and
weave
sometimes
good
all right
um we
have
this guy
he takes
unless there's
magic carpets
in here that
are gonna try
to strangle
me
nine points
of damage
he
stumbles
out
looking
pretty
bedraggled
um
and he
will see
you guys
if you fly
over
exactly
that is
the plan
that's 100%
the plan
it's all
coming
together
it's all
fine
it's all
fine
it's not
gonna end
well for me
what are you
doing
see
he is going
to
moves
he's
good
yes
cure
wounds
i did
in fact
you did
ask me
about the
trigger
mechanism
yep
i
we
we had
that
conversation
when you
were
do i
get a
luck
point
for
missing
the
ball
oh yeah
absolutely
i will
take one
absolutely
thank you
please
please keep
me honest
about those
what
happened
when you
shot
through
the
thing
i just
got caught
by the
wind
yeah
well
like
was it
harder
to hit
yes
it is
25
oh
okay
just
essentially
have
more
ac
okay
so he's
going to
heal
himself
cleric
and
that's
his
turn
skirt
all right
so here's
what i
want to
do
you tell
me if
i can
do it
yeah
jesric
and i
back when
he was
first deploying
this thing
back at
the end
i showed
me the
trigger
mechanism
for this
thing
we actually
had a
whole
conversation
about
yeah
what i
would like
to do
is go
up here
trigger it
to launch
myself over
these guys
so they
don't provoke
attacks of
opportunity
and land
next to
this ball
okay
i think
i'm going
to need
an athletics
role
trigger it
and
there are
new rules
to cover
this
so
if i
could do
it
i'm doing
one athletics
rule
and i was
able to
just basically
jump on
there trigger
it
okay
and on
on a dc
15 or
above
you're able
to
trigger it
and you're
able to
escape the
attacks of
opportunity
okay
and then
i want a
throne
weapons
rule
okay
you are the
throne weapon
we're looking
if you roll
above a
if you roll
above a
10
then you
are
then you
land
somewhere
in here
okay
roll above
if you roll
above 15
you land
exactly where
you want to
go
okay
i'm raging
before all
this happens
that gives
you advantage
on athletics
yes
yep
and yeah
and i'm
specifically using
a throne
weapon attack
roll for
that so you
can recklessly
attack
yeah
specifically
that's
nice
okay so the
athletics check
is a 17
okay
you you're
able to
you're able
to make
make it
past the
guy
no
so you're
not provoking
any type of
opportunity
if you roll
above a 10
you land
somewhere
in here
yep
we got
it
all right
so you
land exactly
where you
want to be
is that
like a 20
it would end
up being a 20
yes it would
modify to a 20
oh yeah we
want to be
here
either right
or if i could
land on it
to also do
some damage
to it in the
process
even if i get
hurt a little
bit that's
fine
yeah we'll
let you do
that
use your
landing
yeah
you are
doing
you are
doing a
range
attack
yeah
so
yeah
first off
we're gonna
we're gonna
resolve the
damage here
you take
four points
of slashing
damage
i take
two points
of slashing
damage
um
and now
sorry
like i mean
technically
you're a
you're a
makeshift
weapon
so
let's
see
that's
that's gonna
be a d4
damage
okay
all right
and uh
it's d4
plus your
strength
so
so eight
you do
eight damage
yep
plus i'm
raging
so another
two
okay you
do
ten
damage
yeah
he stuck
the land
and got
a ten
right
judges
all right
um and you
land right
on it
yep
and then
all
like
damage
yeah i'm
assuming i
take some
damage from
falling or
landing or
yeah it's a
d6
five uh
which way does
that round
somebody i think
i would say
two okay
and then i'm
gonna take
step and
not be landed
on it anymore
that's me
all right
uh
what is
all the
two
okay
that's right
i'm
piloting
a blip
the heavily
armored guy
swigging my
foil
yeah
i'm flying
through the
air
doesn't really
know
what
does his
shield
attach to
a spring
you're
in a
house
fly
i've
never
seen
a
dragon
dream
all right
i'm getting
you to i'm
getting you to
roll on
which direction
is he going
oh
amazing
hi he
goes
towards you
guys
no he's
no he's
going he's
going for you
guys he's not
going to step
into that
that crap
yeah is
this or
mobile
good question
that is a
great question
um i hadn't
considered that
okay
for the purposes
of what
i'm going to
say it
depends
if you're
wanting to
just
it depends
give me a
proposition
and i'll
tell you
whether or
not
i'm just
curious
i don't
have
anything
i can
do
i mean
it's set
up on a
makeshift
pedestal
but it's
it's raging
magical
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
maybe
um
definite
possibility
let's see
all right
so
the uh
the heavily
numbered guy
is going
to
pull out
his great
sword
and he's
going to
move
don't like
that
hmm
yeah
i mean
doesn't really
have
both of
these targets
are kind of
squishy
how'd the
paladin end
up where
it is
the plan
was hit
him with
a trap
yeah
plan was
to get
the trap
into position
it was
just a
bonus
i see
all right
so this
guy he's
going to
attack
each of
you
because
he can
so the
orange one
is mistral
and the
purple one
is
um
low
down
um
so for
throw
john i'm
pretty sure
that he
misses
um
that's an
eleven
head
sure ac
is
right down
here
14
so yeah
he misses
um
maybe
mistral
yes
we've got
a 14
uh
my ac
is a
16
yeah
he whiffs
twice
um
and
to see
it
that would've
been so
awesome
but no
i had to
move up
all right
so he's
gonna use
his bonus
action
to issue
a challenge
to
um
to
xander
uh-oh
what i need
you to do
is
dc 13
charisma save
oh
this is the
same guy
the armored
guy
okay
you're just
gonna roll
20
13
you said
13
17
well
or no
19
i actually
i'm positive
on the save
barely
why are you
complaining
well
there's
my actual
charisma is a
negative one
but i'm
proficient on
charisma save
so it's a
plus one
negative
charisma
thank you
very much
i have
negative
intelligence
he's like
no one
at all
so
this guy
he walks
up he's
got this
big huge
great sword
he swings
at the
ranger
ranger dances
out of the
way
jabs at
the monk
the monk
basically
bats the
blade away
as he
makes his
jab and
then he
points at
the cleric
and says
come fight
me like
a man
and
like
nah bro
it's like
not good
so good
and
now
it's
little
john's
turn
all right
so i'm gonna
attack him
with my
short sword
okay
i don't know
what that means
so times
two
bonus five
yeah so you
have two
short words
okay so that's
what the short
sword is
uh the
bonus is
your plus
on your d20
rule so you
add five to
your d20
roll to see
if you hit him
yep that's
the d20
roll this
yep roll that
add five to it
well
shit
one
six
uh you can
use all three
of your
luck points
that you just
acquired
that you
have
to re-roll
if you
want
oh my gosh
fire it
oh
you need
no
fire
something
that was
those
he needed
to jail
those are
awful
well on the
bright side
yeah
yeah
it only
got you
two for
one deal
wait
try uh
try one
of these
here
mold again
i just
want to
i just
want to
see if
it's you
or if
it's
the mojo
then
better
yeah
yeah
see i
employ the
uh
same
regal
technique
no
it is a
drop
right
um
well
also
i've got
a part
can move
at this
point
if you
want to
if you
do move
out of
this guy's
um
attack range
then he
will be
able to
do an
opportunity
attack but
considering that
you're
combatant it
might still
be worth
up to
you
yep
so
i also feel
like this is
a time
honored
tradition
a time
a place to
introduce the
time
honored
tradition of
sometimes
if you're
just rolling
shitty all
night
you magically
just rolled
well
that's
fair
all
about it
that's
fair
that
that is
fair
all right
so he
does hit
you
what problem
virtual table
i know
harder to cheat
for
four
uh
seven
plus
well
actually
he just
hits you
for ten
damage
that's how
i'm doing
it
uh
so my
my health
is
uh
yeah
you've
got the
current
so
um
you can
either do
current
as like
subtracting
your max
health
or
adding
just
depending
on what
you're
going to
do
uh
you
you just
take
10
oh
so
yeah
b-a-t
yep
yep
all right
which again
you know
considering the
location that
you were in
like even
even getting
hit that's
probably a
uh
no
and don't
forget
everybody has
a bunch
of healing
potions
too
i left
in the
i don't
have any
don't die
right there
go ahead
yeah
yeah
what
what i'm
going to
be doing
i am
going to
be
you
think
oh
you're
going to
be making
your sacred
weapon
no
sacred
light
sacred
lights
remind me
30 foot
burst
aberrations
face
fiends
are undead
have a
christmas save
or become
blinded
um
the
none of
these are
actually a
fiend
they are
just fiend
influenced
oh
so
okay
um
unfortunately
that would
not work
not
and
um
but
the deeper
you get
into the
cult
the more
likely it is
you're going
to see
things
okay
and
then i'm
going to use
sacred weapon
the
the
sacred weapon
then i'm
i'm
so
just
just as a
reminder
we are on
a time crunch
here
okay
like
okay
this is going
to get
very untenable
very quickly
so if you're
not doing
something
if you're doing
something that's
a setup
just
just bear that
in mind
when you're
doing it
so
you
you are
more than
welcome to
do a
sacred
uh
sacred weapon
i'm not
going to
tell you
not to
i'm just
saying
just keep
in mind
that we
are in
a time
crunch
and i
mean you
do have
your
barbarian
hanging
out right
and it's
the thing
that needs
to get
destroyed
so chances
of it
getting
loaded up
this one
is a little
bit too
small
it's
perfect
you think
oh
film
is a role
playing
thing
it doesn't
do any
actual
damage
so
it's
minor miracle
because it's
divine
it is
except for
it doesn't
actually
do anything
in combat
outside of
combat
it's
one of the
more powerful
spells
in the
games
why don't
you
just go
with what
you were
originally
planning on
doing
so
just
like
you're
planning on
moving up
and opening
up your
sacred
weapon
right
sacred
weapon
yeah
I was
going to
guard
guard
all right
perfect
so you
basically
make sure
that everybody
around you
that the
next person
that the
next person
that attacks
anybody that's
next to you
does their
first attack
does so
at disadvantage
so
of course
pretty solid
sorry I was
like you should
do this
and it's like
no you
do you
man
yeah I'll
stop telling
you how to
play your own
character
you do
you
okay
well basically
I was going
to just take
the light
that basically
I was going
to make
so we can
get out
of this
corner here
well you
can get
out of the
corner
you're just
you just
walk out
he just
attacks you
when you're
leaving
yeah
just take
one attack
about two
yeah
does he get
is that how
that works
you get
multiple
text
opportunity
oh no
you're right
he's already
used his
reaction so
you're free
to go
you don't
have to be
anywhere near
oh
so if
you want
to move
up you
can
good call
Derek
that's
for keeping
me honest
okay
I'm sure
if you're
filming the
rules for
Jack
like
D&D
yeah
that's
usually a
good assumption
okay
what I'm
going to be
doing
is I'm
going to be
moving up
to the
to the
boss
say what
what boss
the trap
no
the guy
who summoned
this thing
okay
that's
that's
the
blue
pog
I'm
probably
the
blue
guy
yeah
so
you
did
currently
run up
to him
if you
moved
here
you
both of
them are
threatening
you though
at that
point
or you're
threatening
both of
them
which is
a good
place to
be
so
okay
so you
open up
your sacred
weapon
you
you move
up
you're good
my
shield
is already
out
right
yeah
so you've
got
you've got
your guard
up
we're
we're
we're
good
you're
out of
actions
and you're
right where
you want
to be
which is
actually
you actually
did a
pretty good
um
this guy
he's going
to cast
a spell
you know
what that
means
well
smack him
exactly
um
and when
when
when
the green
guy starts
casting
you have
an attack
of opportunity
so go ahead
and roll
a d20
you know
pretty good
and my
hammer
plus
seven
and
i'm
21
21 will
hit
how much
damage
okay let's
see
okay
basically my
attack rolls
are now
based off
of my
charisma
no no
that's
your
to hit
so
you
add your
charisma
to your
strength
so you
just add
your charisma
on top
of your
your
attack
okay
so you
hit
more
so you
you hit
more often
yeah
you don't
miss as much
which is
great
yep
and
that's
good
now
damage
is just
rolling your
warhammer
damage
which is
a d8
d8 plus
four
plus
four
do you
what's your
strength
modifier
plus
four
oh my
plus
five
because you
got your
because you
got plus
one
you need to
update that
to five
instead of
four
okay
okay
you also need to
update your
attack with
a plus
one
two
we can
let's
touch on that
later
i think he
did that
because if he
did plus
seven
yeah
then he
would
okay
yeah so
the plus
one is
both to
attack
and
end
okay
so
all right
give me
give me
that sweet
sweet
oh it's
pretty good
and that
is
11
okay
all right
and let's
take
oh you have
initiative order
up here at the
top
yeah
yes
all right
so he's
going to
shoot
he's
gonna shoot
you
yep
yeah
and my
guards
all we got
oh yeah
so he's
got his
advantage
so that
will be
a
23
to hit
which will
hit your
20
yep
so you
take
10
points
of
fire
damage
get
fire
okay
fire
up
okay
and
i'm also
going to
need you
to make
a
dc
13
charisma
save
roll
d20
both
which is
quite
more
yeah
so
okay
16
okay
good
you are
not
i mean
you are
not
within
holy
prison
oh
probably
good
good
for him
all right
miss roll
yes
jason
what you
gonna do
um
okay so
the hand
wraps
do the
are those
always on
they don't
they don't
require like
an action
okay
you got it
always make
you better
at the
pumpkin
i said
i don't
all right
i don't know
if i have
this in the
right order
i wish
i want
to do
it
but i
think
can i
do the
produce
flames
first
and then
do my
unarmed
attack
no
you
that's
all
together
oh
okay
so
every
unarmed
attack
that you
make
you're
rolling
a d4
damage
plus
a d6
damage
pretty
good
plus
you have
an additional
plus one
two
damage
plus one
two
attack
and if
you hit
them with
the hand
wraps
and they're
wearing an
armor they
have a
negative one
ac for the
rest of the
combat
yeah so i want
to do an
unarmed attack
on this guy that
came up
talking to us
yeah i mean
pretty much
if you're if
you're just
looking at
pure power
at this
point punching
people is more
powerful than
hitting the
stick
yeah
yeah but i
wasn't for
sure if i
could do
like the
if me
doing the
produce or
again never
mind that's
a weapon so
you never
mind i see
what you're
saying what
you're saying
yep
everything
together
all right so
i'm gonna do
d20
two uh yeah
you're gonna
miss yeah
i don't even
need to
dang
i got myself
all hyped up
for nothing
you can use
your bonus
action in
flurry of
blows
yeah oh
yeah
oh and
you get
milk
yep
all right
so
there we
go
17 on
that one
17 will
not hit
a
class of
18
what was
it
do i
add to
that
oh yeah
oh yeah
so they
added your
bonus
sticks
yep
yep
yeah so
i'm at
a 23
yeah
class
of 18
yes
you're
actually
adding
seven
to that
because
the
plus
one
ramps
but yes
oh yeah
yeah
or no
that's with
the
i already
added
yeah
he's
got
16
oh
and then i
do a
four
and
six
and add
all
again
six
plus
yep
oh
plus
plus
four
plus
four
ten
yeah
monk
so ten
points
let's be
monk
how much
ten
ten
and did you
include the
plus one
damage for
the uh
yes
yep
yep
okay
and then since
how that was
the furry
yeah
the furry
of both
i get to
i do
i do the
20 again
20
yeah
yep
yeah
oh that's
right
that's per
14
uh
so 20
oh my gosh
seven
so 11 points
yep
thunder
boom boom
hmm
hmm
we're ready
giving people
all these
awesome
messages
this is
this is
what is
helping
first
yes
all right
xander
all right
xander
um
i
am
going to
raise
my
shield
um
um
i will
say
um
implements
of
moraine
assist us
and i'm
going to
summon a
spiritual
weapon
right here
oh
uh
so right
behind the
orb
uh
is going
to appear
what would
be
moraine's
favorite
weapon
i mean
probably just
a trident
right
yeah
probably
a spear
one of
those two
probably
yep
yeah
yeah
we'll
spear
just
so it's
a little
less
uh
cliche
and we'll
attack
with uh
pointing
that will
hit
excellent
love
to hear
it
and it's
all
sacred
ac
or
whatever
it is
you know
the one
spiritual
weapon
spiritual
weapon
ah
boop
uh
eight
points
of damage
you do
thirteen
points
of damage
okay
oh
excellent
um
i'm
going to
use my
action
because
spiritual
weapon
is a
bonus
action
to
cast
sacred
flame
on it
and it
needs to
make a
duck
save
probably
gonna be
pretty bad
at that
uh
well
it doesn't
make it
duck
save
uh
however
uh
the magic
dissipates
off
okay
good to
know
good to
know
how your
sacred
weapon
worked
and the
other
one
yeah
magic
things
that's
me
you
i mean
you did
oh
oh yeah
no
all right
so we are
at the
beginning
of the
round
and
something
meanders
in
something
wicked
that this
way
comes
gondor has
called
raid
yeah
what you
see
is a
monstrous
creature
yeah
yeah
yeah
it used
to be
an elf
but there
is some
sort of
there like
the coral
the coral
itself has
kind of like
just
has grown
off of
its skin
its eyes
actually
look like
pearls
in its
eye sockets
and its
skin
and under
its skin
and its veins
a bioluminescence
a bioluminescent
fluid flows
it moves
around
sluggishly
and
almost like
almost like
it doesn't
really have
a full
consciousness
to the
fray
that's our
monster
that got
called
by the
yeah
that's
absolutely
all right
um
jesrik
jesrik
is going
to
uh
a cop
for the
wind
and
try to
hit the
globe
again
because
that is
what we
are trying
to do
so that's
what i'm
going to
try to
do
okay
uh
nope
i
there's
personally
this time
you over
compensated
his
uh
yeah
huzzah
his uh
bombastic
crossbow
pops up
in his
face
i'll take
this luck
point
yes you
will
and do
you have
bonus
that
um
i could
use
some
bomb
jabs
let me
just double
check here
real quick
i think
it's
nope
because
that's
going to
do
the same
thing
that
that
would
have
done
so
nope
okay
and the
acolyte
is going
to go
um
who is
going to
he's going
to
melee combat
so he's
going to
try and
stab
the guy
who's
in
plate
armor
yeah
when he's
not a
melee
combatant
because that
that always
works
well
it didn't
work
he's almost
there
so he
tries to
stab you
and it
just kind
of glances
off here
i mean
he couldn't
move
because he's
already
used his
attack of
opportunity
that's
true
um
well
he will
move
sorry
i couldn't
be helping
take a
gander
at my
glorious
spring
trap
he's not
going
near
it's
not a
trap
it's
a
tool
all right
best traps
mark
you are
out
uh
we're gonna
smash the
shit out
of this
beacon
yeah
i think
i'll
leave
i don't
want to
be
in
here
anymore
uh
you
speaking
oh
it's
my
turn
is
when i
say
damage
so
uh
five
so
we
take
two
that's
perfect
all right
and i'm
gonna recklessly
attack
are you
kidding me
are you
actually
kidding
oh no
two ones
ones
oh no
good leg
a luck
point
please
there's
your
one
in
four
hundred
i'm
gonna use
my
bonus
action
to
attack
yeah
because i
can do
that now
if i roll
two ones
again
i'm getting
up and i'm
moving
if i roll
two ones
again you can
spend three
luck points
into another
one
yes
you can
i want the
odds of four
or more
all right at least
one of those is
gonna hit
that was shitty
damage
oh my god
uh
uh
fifteen plus
seven is a
twenty-two
to hit
twenty-two
does hit
uh
for eight
damage
for
eight
show
eight
some
yeah
for
eighteen
damage
you can
just hear
over the
howling wind
coming from
inside
a stream
of
foul and
vile
curses
against
marine
particularly
after the
first attack
um
well
as luck
would happen
oh you're
not quite
there
totally fine
i'm not
taking much
damage sitting
in here
anyway
it's
right
yeah
uh
well
actually
you're not
there yet
we're good
so close
all right
uh
the knight
is going
to
oh
move in
all right
i mean he
wanted a
1v1b
so
and he
is going
to 1v1
you
perfect
what
all right
one hits
all right
10 points
of damage
oh
sorry i pissed
them off
concentration
yes
they are
they are
sick
uh
because i
was
i had
foresight
when i
took
uh
warcaster
that 4
is actually
an 8
that's pretty
good
so that
becomes
a 10
which is
i believe
what i need
to pass
actually
just barely
assuming it
all works
like dnd
and that
that part
does
yeah
all right
um
shoot
this
power
of
we're
actually
so
here's
that armor
guy
i can still
hit him
right
he's totally
roll my d20
whatever this
is
all right
is that
20
10
oh
almost
10
plus
whatever
10
plus
5
yeah
10
plus
5
so
that's
15
um
if you
had aimed
it would
have been
17
which still
wouldn't
have gotten
you
well
actually
if you
aim
and attack
that would
have been
17
because armor
class is an
18
you have
one luck
pointer
okay
you should
make that
attack
all right
let's do
that
okay
then roll
your
and he has
taken damage
at this
point
so
your
extra d4
counts
also
you could
choose to
use your
um
you could
choose to
use your
mystic mark
on there
which would
add another
d4
okay
so
that would
be a
d8
plus
two
d4
so
that's
this
mystic mark
hitting me
okay
all right
so
this would
be your
last mystic
mark of
this long
rest
if you
did that
but
okay
sure
i can
actually
contribute
yeah
so
you're
rolling
a d8
which is
this one
plus
you're
rolling
this
guy
twice
and
then
you're
adding
turns out
advantage
bird
says
seven
how hard
is it
to hit a
ball
right
it's
a two
standing
right next
to it
it doesn't
attack
by
that's a
four
so
seven
nine
thirteen
plus
five
so
that's
eighteen
eighteen
eighteen
points
damage
no
what did
say
i
got my
bow
in my
hand
oh my
god that's
a bitch
he got
there
easy
he's still
alive but he
got there
on his
chest
yeah he
has an
arrow
in his
chest
he's
starting to
breathe
labor
laborly
one might
even say
if one
were counting
one might
say he's
near
death
which
one
the
night
sick
the guy
that's
attacking
me
yeah
yeah
yeah
long to
see
you
arthur
you're
up
okay
okay
i am
just going
to
i'm
i am
just
going
i'm
just
going
to
attack
the
guy
in front
of
me
yeah
yeah
um
i actually
probably need
to go
okay
45
minutes
yeah
yeah
yeah
true
true
true
okay
um
i mean
when it
comes to
my turn
somebody
knows how
to play
barbarian
you can
do your
thing
yep
yep
yep
dave
yeah
i will
i will
give you
this
um
when the
when the
thing gets
exploded
you get
zotted
and
you get
a magic
item
sick
sick
so
i'm
i'm
going to
check
the guy
in front
of me
with my
with my
warhammer
okay
sorry to
jet out
but
no
no
no
it's
we
i was
i was
really hoping
that we'd
be able
to get
through
this
but
like
we're
at
we're
at
10 30
now
let's
get
this
get
him
hey
what's
how we're
rolling
you need
to use
luck
points
to use
them
freely
i have
to give
them
five
luck
points
i mean
it would
have been
a shorter
combat
if people
stopped
rolling
wait
wait
wait
i
might
charge
that
because
i
have
yeah
you
add
your
charisma
have
a good
night
guys
for
that
guy
he
is
oh
yeah
that'll
get

what's
that
one
goes
to the
left
and
one
goes
to the
left
yeah
it's
basically
it's
been
sacred
weapon
yeah
but
the
damage
is
just
the
hammer
just
the
hammer
okay
yeah
second
weapon
only does
your
attack
okay
doesn't
do
your
damage
okay
here we
go
that'll
be
nine
right
and i'm
smacking
him in
the face
with it
right
smacking
him in
the face

and
my bonus
action
i'm
going to
be
laying
hands
on
myself

off
i don't

you
really
sucks

points

your
pool
um
i'm
going
to
rise
that
up
four
tubs
so

so
so
i can
get
20
at
least
okay
um
all
right
uh
colt's
well
this
fanatic
is
going
to
be
trying
to
blow
some
blow
somebody
up
uh
so
he's
going
to
shoot
at
the
guy
that
just
like
almost
decimated
his
knight
so
little
gentleman
19
hit
and
that
will
be
six
points
of
damage
do
oh
yeah
and then
we have
that
guy
we need
all
that
guy
not
that
guy
it's
it is
indeed
it
moves
ooh
it
moves
NYU
day
wow
damn
excellent
it
will
attempt
to
itt
Attempt to attack?
He's breathlessly.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Slamming.
I don't know.
Crit.
A crit?
Okay.
Let's go for E. Barbs.
Well, unfortunately
not for him. A crit
for this guy is
10 points damage, so
5 for him.
Yeah, it tickles.
Did the Backeye take
some storm damage?
It did.
Yeah, it did.
Excellent.
Alright.
Mr. Ron Zander.
Uh-huh.
I know we're at the...
I know we're at...
Like, we're running really late, so...
Just...
I think if I need to
just call it right now
and take a picture of this
and pick it back up.
Yeah.
Oh, you're fine.
What are you thinking, Jason?
You are all right, man.
Yeah.
I thought I had it all
stayed out in my head
and then...
And then the dude moved.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, I feel like...
Right, because this guy...
The armored guy's almost dead.
Yeah.
How confident do you feel
in your attack
if I was to go
for this guy over here?
Oh, super confident.
Okay.
So then I'm just
going to finish this guy off.
Okay.
Stick.
So, can I make
a recommendation?
Yeah.
Flank him.
Yeah.
I'll get advantage.
Yeah.
Ah, I forgot about that.
Okay.
All right.
So then I move first
and then I'm going...
So that's what I'm going to do.
Yeah.
Since we control 2d20
and take the highest...
15.
We're good.
And a 19.
That will hit.
Okay.
And then...
You're looking at a d4, d6...
So, six.
Six.
Yeah.
He's dead yet.
How many technique points
you got left?
Three.
What was the bonus
for flanking?
You've got to roll
the d20 twice.
Oh, okay.
All right.
Yeah.
Let's use a technique point
and see if we can't
just get him in there.
Um, and if you do hit him
and you...
I don't know.
I think this works
regardless.
I'm going to say it works.
Yeah.
If you hit him
and you kill him
and you have an attack left,
you haven't used
your full move.
Uh-huh.
So, move again
and attack somebody else.
Okay.
Yep.
Yep.
I mean, I think that's correct.
But it's how it would work
in D&D.
Three.
Which, that's...
Yeah, I'm going to say
I think it's still
what's going on.
Maybe...
You've set advantage.
18.
That will hit.
That's a lot.
So, that's your, uh...
That was second attack.
That's your second attack.
Yep.
So...
Come on.
Don't give me more than this.
Seven...
So, an 11.
Yep.
All right.
You destroy this guy.
Yeah.
Cool.
So,
how do you want to kill them?
Uh...
Uh...
So, it was just
kind of...
I missed with the jab
and I followed through
with that uppercut
and just kind of
knock...
Send his helmet
and head flying.
All right.
Nice.
And...
Where do you want to move?
Uh...
Let's go...
Blue or green?
Uh...
Let's head towards...
Blue or green?
Yeah.
Let's head towards
the green guy
because I want to
make it my way
to the orb as well.
Five...
Ten...
Twenty...
Twenty...
Twenty-five...
Thirty...
Thirty-five...
Okay.
Yep.
Attack.
Take it.
All righty.
Yeah.
So, yeah.
You can make another attack.
Yeah.
Oh.
Your third attack still?
Yeah.
Oh.
All right.
So, D20 again?
Yeah.
Roll it twice.
Roll it twice
because you got an advantage.
No, we've got an advantage.
Thirteen.
Release.
And an eight.
Okay.
So, thirteen
plus your...
My bonus is a six.
Yeah.
So, that will hit
an E.P. of twelve.
I'm pretty sure
that's what he's got.
And...
Seven...
So, eleven points.
Eleven points.
Eight, eight, eight, eight.
Okay.
You are...
He is...
This one is now
near death.
Excellent.
Xander.
All right.
You are free
to do what you...
Yeah, I know.
It's awesome.
All right.
Step one.
Use my bonus action
to have my spiritual weapon
attack that orb.
Orb.
Fourteen.
So, how about
twenty-one?
Twenty-one will be
most surety.
Excellent.
Oh, very nice.
Thirteen.
Thirteen points
of radiant damage.
And that will be
enough to destroy it.
So,
a couple things
happen here.
This thing
gets destroyed.
All right.
Um...
This,
likewise,
gets destroyed.
The winds
themselves
blow...
Uh...
Well, I mean
this thing.
But, um...
Skirk gets
knocked back.
Takes...
Takes a number
of damage
that he inevitably
soaks because
he's barbarian.
That's what he does.
Um...
When he wakes up
or when he gets up,
you guys
notice
that his
anchor
is
damp
and
there is
a bunch of
lightning...
Lightning
things that are
going around
with it.
Um...
And this is
important for
everybody to know
for Dave's character
specifically.
His...
His magic item
is a little bit
finicky.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Um...
It's a plus one
flail.
Uh-huh.
Which is not
finicky.
But...
His weapon
gets, um...
When it is
doused in water,
which for him
to do would
take a bonus
action and he
has to be near
water.
Yep.
It gets a
additional
2d6
um...
Lightning
damage.
For two
rounds.
Oh, okay.
This thing scales
with his
proficiency
bonus.
Yep.
So, it's
2d6
because his
proficiency
bonus is
2.
When it
goes 3
ob3
and the
rounds
scale with
proficiency
bonus as
well.
But...
This only
works if
it's wet.
Yep.
Yep.
So...
If we're
in a battle
mass where
there's no
water,
Yep.
There's a
problem.
He's not
going to be
able to take
full advantage.
Oh, uh-huh.
Just...
Just some...
Just some
little team
play
action.
Um, once
this is
destroyed,
um, the...
These guys,
um, basically
run for it.
Um, Arthur
and Miseral,
you can take
a...
You can take
a attack
Yep.
I'm going to
against this...
Uh, against
the...
This guy,
um,
Yeah.
Or you can
just let him
go.
Yeah, I'm
going to take
an attack.
All right.
Well, it's
like...
Yes.
I'm taking
the attack.
Okay.
I'm going to...
I'm going to
smack his head
again.
All right.
Smack it.
Yeah, 14...
That's actually
a...
21.
Okay, that
will hit.
So roll a...
Roll a D8
for damage.
Roll a D8
pretty damage.
And...
2 plus 5
or 7.
That is just
enough to
knock him
down.
So he
basically...
He runs
for it.
You swat him
in the head
and he
stumbles a
little...
a few feet
out and
then just
kind of
falls to
his knees
and falls
down.
Uh, face...
face first.
He's
knocked out.
Uh, he's
dead.
Okay.
He's dead.
But forever.
He just...
But he's
only just
dead.
This guy
didn't have
anybody near
him, so
he just
took off.
All right.
Um, as you
guys are kind
of settling
down, um,
everybody...
Well, I'll
give you
loot when
we get
everybody back
together, so
I'll have to
get Dave
caught up.
Um, and
we'll pick
up next
second.
Sick.
Sounds good.
Thanks for,
sir.
Thanks for, uh,
sticking with me
a little bit
longer.
I know it
was...
I, Jim, I
really try and
make sure I
hit these
things well,
but...
No problem.
We'll do
better next
time.
Yeah.
We had a
pen full of
swing of a
missus.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, even...
I need to
figure out a
way of Ryan
being able to
not roll
above a...
Ryan and
Dave...
Right?
...to not roll
above a four.
That was...
That was painful.
I want you
guys being
awesome.
Jeff?
Uh...
Anybody
actually mark
how much luck
we have, or...
Uh, yeah,
so...
that is...
right there.
Uh-huh.
Where...
Oh.
And then...
Make sure you
hold here.
Um...
Oh, you can
keep it if you
want, but I
can hold on to
it, too.
Either way.
And say, I
think I got it
for them, but
it doesn't matter.
Actually, yes,
it does, because
I have a dog
downstairs that...
Likes to chew
on things?
I won't...
I won't jinx it.
She hasn't gotten
any of this stuff
yet, but...
I just did
jinx it.
Never mind.
Oh, yeah.
