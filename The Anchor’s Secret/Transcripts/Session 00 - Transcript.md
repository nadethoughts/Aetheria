WEBVTT
00:00.000 --> 00:00.780
No planning.
00:01.020 --> 00:04.040
I actually use this pretty heavily.
00:05.200 --> 00:05.440
All right.
00:05.460 --> 00:11.080
So what artifact or relic did you recover from the runes of old Penmaris
00:11.080 --> 00:14.460
that still hums faintly with untamed magic, Derek?
00:14.460 --> 00:18.520
So before this place flooded for some reason and became, like, an island,
00:18.860 --> 00:20.600
how big was it?
00:21.200 --> 00:24.360
Was it still coastal or...?
00:24.360 --> 00:25.480
It was Florida.
00:26.000 --> 00:27.040
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
00:27.100 --> 00:28.760
So it was still coastal and all that stuff.
00:30.000 --> 00:36.880
I'm going to say it's, like, this, like, broken compass.
00:38.640 --> 00:40.460
What the heck is a Swedish compass?
00:41.060 --> 00:46.920
It might have some sort of, like, you know, maybe like a star chart on it
00:46.920 --> 00:48.060
or something like that.
00:49.440 --> 00:54.200
And that's sort of the magic that you can see is when you open it up,
00:54.260 --> 00:56.940
it, you know, glows with, like, a little star chart.
00:57.380 --> 00:57.660
Okay.
00:57.660 --> 01:03.820
All right, so you have a star chart compass that you recovered from the wreckage of old Penmaris.
01:03.960 --> 01:04.720
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
01:04.880 --> 01:06.020
All right, sounds good.
01:07.460 --> 01:08.280
Thanks, Derek.
01:08.940 --> 01:10.360
Dave, go ahead and give me a roll.
01:12.720 --> 01:13.120
Thirteen.
01:13.900 --> 01:14.300
Thirteen.
01:14.300 --> 01:27.760
Dave, what friend, mentor, or ally did you lose during a mission to secure the harbor?
01:28.320 --> 01:30.720
And what promise did you make in their memory?
01:31.680 --> 01:33.460
Oh, that's 100%.
01:33.460 --> 01:35.620
So, after...
01:35.620 --> 01:36.620
So, after...
01:36.620 --> 01:39.620
Derek's case, the Rebolts.
01:39.620 --> 01:43.620
He wanted to make a forward.
01:43.620 --> 01:56.080
So, after Old Penmaris was in the burning fire of whatever the hell it was called, the Flaming Retribution.
01:56.340 --> 01:56.640
Yes.
01:56.640 --> 02:08.180
Skirk the Kobold got a shitty job working the shitty docks in this district that ended up getting flooded and run over by monsters.
02:08.440 --> 02:08.600
Okay.
02:08.600 --> 02:13.360
And he didn't have a lot of friends, but he did have one, and it was his actual...
02:13.360 --> 02:17.700
It was his dockmaster, like the person in charge of his dock crew.
02:18.040 --> 02:18.240
Okay.
02:18.240 --> 02:31.360
And that's actually what sort of led Skirk into his first rage, is like he saw the guy die, and then Skirk just picked up the nearest thing he could find and started wailing on monsters.
02:31.920 --> 02:33.040
And it was a boat anchor.
02:33.720 --> 02:34.200
Okay.
02:34.700 --> 02:37.240
And so he promised that he's never going...
02:37.240 --> 02:40.760
He will do his best to protect the people around him.
02:41.200 --> 02:41.580
Okay.
02:41.800 --> 02:42.100
Awesome.
02:43.640 --> 02:47.120
Ian, I need you to pick up a d20 and roll.
02:47.120 --> 02:48.680
He can't protect the people.
02:48.680 --> 02:49.820
He cannot protect himself.
02:51.140 --> 02:51.380
No.
02:52.640 --> 02:53.280
No.
02:55.040 --> 02:57.840
I mean, he couldn't protect himself, so...
02:57.840 --> 02:58.420
All right, roll up.
02:58.940 --> 02:59.360
Okay.
03:02.720 --> 03:03.240
Five.
03:04.240 --> 03:12.680
All right, Ian, what oath did you swear to the people or the city that still guides your every choice?
03:13.880 --> 03:15.020
That's pretty good for a paladin.
03:15.540 --> 03:16.380
Yeah, that makes...
03:16.380 --> 03:18.080
You guys have been doing great with these.
03:18.720 --> 03:19.080
Yeah.
03:21.720 --> 03:24.560
What oath did I make?
03:26.660 --> 03:26.920
Hmm.
03:29.700 --> 03:30.100
I...
03:30.100 --> 03:32.320
I made the...
03:32.320 --> 03:33.940
I made the oath to...
03:33.940 --> 03:38.440
If you want some...
03:38.440 --> 03:39.840
If you want some assistance, like...
03:39.840 --> 03:39.940
Yeah.
03:39.940 --> 03:40.440
That's why you're...
03:40.440 --> 03:42.080
I definitely want some assistance here.
03:42.400 --> 03:42.680
Okay.
03:43.280 --> 03:45.220
So, what's your, uh...
03:45.220 --> 03:51.120
What's your paladin's general disposition towards the city?
03:51.120 --> 03:54.120
Um...
03:54.120 --> 03:55.560
Of New Penmaris?
03:57.300 --> 03:58.360
He sees it...
03:58.360 --> 04:01.400
He sees it as better than the...
04:01.400 --> 04:02.360
As the...
04:02.360 --> 04:02.860
Older...
04:02.860 --> 04:03.540
Older city.
04:03.700 --> 04:04.180
Other city.
04:04.180 --> 04:07.420
He thinks it's a new start from what...
04:07.420 --> 04:08.260
It's a fresh start.
04:08.420 --> 04:08.820
Fresh start.
04:08.820 --> 04:08.880
Okay.
04:09.380 --> 04:11.360
So, what sort of oath about...
04:11.360 --> 04:12.360
That...
04:12.360 --> 04:17.820
That sounds like an oath of renewal or an oath of supporting, um...
04:17.820 --> 04:18.480
The...
04:18.480 --> 04:20.460
An oath to support the new...
04:20.460 --> 04:20.820
Yeah, like...
04:20.820 --> 04:21.260
Uh...
04:21.260 --> 04:22.960
He, like, grew up in the previous city.
04:22.960 --> 04:23.860
The regrowth.
04:24.060 --> 04:26.760
Yeah, like, he grew up in the previous city and it was all...
04:26.760 --> 04:28.540
Shitty for him, so...
04:28.540 --> 04:28.760
Okay.
04:29.000 --> 04:29.440
He...
04:29.440 --> 04:29.960
He...
04:29.960 --> 04:30.140
He...
04:30.140 --> 04:31.140
He saw...
04:31.140 --> 04:34.200
He saw the rebuilding and saw an opportunity to...
04:34.200 --> 04:36.180
So, it's a rebirth kind of thing.
04:36.180 --> 04:36.980
Rebirth, yes.
04:36.980 --> 04:37.240
Okay.
04:37.840 --> 04:39.600
To make it better than it...
04:39.600 --> 04:40.140
Than...
04:40.140 --> 04:41.340
Than the other street...
04:41.340 --> 04:42.480
To make it through...
04:42.480 --> 04:42.780
Okay.
04:43.780 --> 04:45.520
I think that's a great oath right there.
04:45.640 --> 04:47.780
Like, I vowed to make new Penmaris.
04:47.820 --> 04:49.020
Penmaris better than...
04:49.020 --> 04:49.720
Old Penmaris.
04:49.720 --> 04:50.120
Yeah.
04:50.120 --> 04:50.520
Yeah.
04:50.520 --> 04:51.020
Yeah, yeah.
04:51.020 --> 04:56.700
And that actually fits in really well with kind of what this adventure is specifically
04:56.700 --> 04:58.200
supposed to be about, so...
04:58.200 --> 04:58.300
Yeah.
04:58.300 --> 04:59.200
All right.
04:59.200 --> 05:00.260
So, there you go.
05:00.260 --> 05:00.760
That...
05:00.760 --> 05:01.700
Does that work for you?
05:01.700 --> 05:02.940
Yeah, that definitely works for you.
05:02.940 --> 05:03.540
Perfect.
05:03.540 --> 05:04.580
Yeah, basically, it took...
05:04.580 --> 05:05.940
It took me a minute, but yes.
05:05.940 --> 05:07.280
No, no, absolutely.
05:07.900 --> 05:08.280
That's...
05:08.280 --> 05:08.980
That's why...
05:08.980 --> 05:09.600
It's a great collaborative story.
05:09.600 --> 05:12.820
That's why we're doing this together, so that we can build it with each other.
05:12.820 --> 05:14.320
I also got a picture ready for...
05:14.320 --> 05:16.180
Shit, I can't read an AI picture.
05:16.180 --> 05:16.680
Yeah, yeah.
05:16.680 --> 05:17.680
Yeah.
05:17.680 --> 05:18.680
All right.
05:18.680 --> 05:20.680
I mean, I gotta very quickly be a very good artist.
05:20.680 --> 05:21.680
Very cool.
05:21.680 --> 05:22.680
Very cool.
05:22.680 --> 05:23.680
This is me.
05:23.680 --> 05:24.680
Nice.
05:24.680 --> 05:25.680
Awesome.
05:25.680 --> 05:26.680
Very cool.
05:26.680 --> 05:27.680
I like it.
05:27.680 --> 05:28.680
All right.
05:28.680 --> 05:30.680
Minus the thing that made that thing change me.
05:30.680 --> 05:31.680
That's post-action.
05:31.680 --> 05:32.680
Fair.
05:32.680 --> 05:34.680
I'll just say fur.
05:34.680 --> 05:35.680
All right.
05:35.680 --> 05:36.680
Fur enough.
05:36.680 --> 05:37.680
Fur enough.
05:37.680 --> 05:39.680
Jason, can you roll a d20 for me?
05:39.680 --> 05:40.680
Yep.
05:40.680 --> 05:41.680
Eight.
05:41.680 --> 05:42.680
All right.
05:42.680 --> 05:53.680
What dangerous salvage did you and your allies recover from a shipwreck off the island's coast?
05:53.680 --> 05:56.680
And what secret did you find aboard?
05:56.680 --> 06:08.680
I'm going to say we found a collection of treasure maps.
06:08.680 --> 06:09.680
Treasure maps.
06:09.680 --> 06:10.680
Oh.
06:10.680 --> 06:11.680
Okay.
06:11.680 --> 06:12.680
Okay.
06:12.680 --> 06:13.680
Treasure.
06:13.680 --> 06:14.680
I like it.
06:14.680 --> 06:15.680
Um...
06:15.680 --> 06:18.680
Can you repeat the second part of the question?
06:18.680 --> 06:19.680
I'm sorry.
06:19.680 --> 06:20.680
What's...
06:20.680 --> 06:21.680
What was it?
06:21.680 --> 06:22.680
A secret?
06:22.680 --> 06:25.680
What dangerous salvage, which is the treasure maps.
06:25.680 --> 06:27.680
Those are definitely dangerous salvage.
06:27.680 --> 06:28.680
Um...
06:28.680 --> 06:32.680
Did you and your allies recover from a shipwreck off the island's coast?
06:32.680 --> 06:35.680
And what secret did you find aboard?
06:35.680 --> 06:36.680
Hmm.
06:36.680 --> 06:37.680
Hmm.
06:37.680 --> 06:38.680
Um...
06:38.680 --> 06:39.680
Sorry.
06:39.680 --> 06:40.680
All right.
06:40.680 --> 06:41.680
Joseph.
06:41.680 --> 06:42.680
All right.
06:42.680 --> 06:47.680
I'm going to call in for some help on this one once I get a secret to go with some treasure
06:47.680 --> 06:48.680
maps.
06:48.680 --> 06:51.680
Because treasure maps don't sound super dangerous now that you read the question.
06:51.680 --> 06:57.680
Well, like, the danger could have been, like, the actual salvage itself, right?
06:57.680 --> 07:03.680
Like, you had to go out to, you know, this area where, you know, there's monster-infested
07:03.680 --> 07:04.680
waters.
07:04.680 --> 07:05.680
And...
07:05.680 --> 07:07.680
You could also put the secret to how the stuff started, too.
07:07.680 --> 07:09.680
How this whole world reset.
07:09.680 --> 07:10.680
The whole apocalypse happened.
07:10.680 --> 07:18.680
And the dangerous thing, uh, about the treasure maps, it's like, maps are not dangerous.
07:18.680 --> 07:19.680
Treasure maps?
07:19.680 --> 07:20.680
Dangerous.
07:20.680 --> 07:25.680
Like, the secret and the danger could both be, like, whose treasure it is.
07:25.680 --> 07:26.680
Oh, yeah.
07:26.680 --> 07:27.680
Yeah.
07:27.680 --> 07:29.680
Like, it's some big high-flued number.
07:29.680 --> 07:31.680
Yeah, or what's guarding it, or something like that.
07:31.680 --> 07:32.680
Or both.
07:32.680 --> 07:33.680
Yeah.
07:33.680 --> 07:40.680
Okay, so maybe, maybe the maps, the secret as part of the maps lead to what caused the
07:40.680 --> 07:42.680
destruction of the old city.
07:42.680 --> 07:43.680
Okay.
07:43.680 --> 07:44.680
Okay.
07:44.680 --> 07:56.680
The other thought I had was, like, they are, you are not the only one who is looking for
07:56.680 --> 07:59.680
those treasure maps, and you found them first.
07:59.680 --> 08:06.680
So someone else is, like, some powerful person or organization is also hunting for them, and they
08:06.680 --> 08:11.680
have recently found out that, like, the danger is that somebody knows that you have them.
08:11.680 --> 08:12.680
That's like, so my background is criminal as well.
08:12.680 --> 08:13.680
Oh.
08:13.680 --> 08:14.680
Oh.
08:14.680 --> 08:15.680
Oh.
08:15.680 --> 08:16.680
Oh, that, yeah.
08:16.680 --> 08:17.680
Mm-hmm.
08:17.680 --> 08:18.680
You stole them.
08:18.680 --> 08:19.680
Thief.
08:19.680 --> 08:20.680
Thief.
08:20.680 --> 08:21.680
Thief.
08:21.680 --> 08:22.680
No, he salvaged them legitimately.
08:22.680 --> 08:23.680
He salvaged them legitimately.
08:23.680 --> 08:24.680
Right.
08:24.680 --> 08:25.680
He salvaged them legitimately.
08:25.680 --> 08:26.680
Yes.
08:26.680 --> 08:27.680
Yes.
08:27.680 --> 08:28.680
Liar.
08:28.680 --> 08:29.680
Maritime law.
08:29.680 --> 08:30.680
Right.
08:30.680 --> 08:32.680
So, what do you think?
08:32.680 --> 08:33.680
All right.
08:33.680 --> 08:38.680
Yeah, so you're saying basically the secret would be, I'm not the only one that's looking
08:38.680 --> 08:39.680
for them.
08:39.680 --> 08:40.680
Yeah.
08:40.680 --> 08:41.680
Okay.
08:41.680 --> 08:42.680
Yeah, I like that idea.
08:42.680 --> 08:45.680
Maybe the treasure doesn't necessarily have a secret itself, or it does, you just don't
08:45.680 --> 08:46.680
know what it is yet.
08:46.680 --> 08:47.680
Yeah.
08:47.680 --> 08:48.680
Okay.
08:48.680 --> 08:52.680
Yeah, I mean, these questions are not straightforward on purpose, so you can interpret them in
08:52.680 --> 08:53.680
any direction that you want to.
08:53.680 --> 08:54.680
Yeah, I like that.
08:54.680 --> 08:55.680
All right.
08:55.680 --> 08:56.680
Awesome.
08:56.680 --> 09:08.680
So, you found some treasure maps in a shipwreck off the coast of the island, and those treasure
09:08.680 --> 09:22.680
maps are somebody, are what go to an old family or a pirate organization, a strong pirate organization,
09:22.680 --> 09:26.680
and they're on the lookout for those maps.
09:26.680 --> 09:29.680
And you know that they're on the lookout for them.
09:29.680 --> 09:30.680
Yeah.
09:30.680 --> 09:31.680
That sounds good.
09:31.680 --> 09:32.680
Awesome.
09:32.680 --> 09:33.680
Okay.
09:33.680 --> 09:34.680
Cool.
09:34.680 --> 09:35.680
Ramsey?
09:35.680 --> 09:36.680
Oh, I'm sorry.
09:36.680 --> 09:37.680
What are you doing?
09:37.680 --> 09:38.680
All right.
09:38.680 --> 09:39.680
You're good.
09:39.680 --> 09:40.680
Eighteen.
09:40.680 --> 09:41.680
Eighteen.
09:41.680 --> 09:42.680
Eighteen.
09:42.680 --> 09:43.680
What if it looks funny?
09:43.680 --> 09:44.680
Five.
09:44.680 --> 09:46.680
What twice?
09:46.680 --> 09:53.680
What perilous experiment or ritual did you help contain before it could engulf a section
09:53.680 --> 09:54.680
of the city?
09:54.680 --> 09:55.680
Ooh.
09:55.680 --> 09:56.680
Oh.
09:56.680 --> 09:57.680
Oh.
10:01.680 --> 10:02.680
Hmm.
10:03.680 --> 10:04.680
You trust me.
10:04.680 --> 10:10.680
How long ago was the invasions in the docks?
10:10.680 --> 10:11.680
Was that relatively recent?
10:11.680 --> 10:12.680
Six months, right?
10:12.680 --> 10:15.680
The Tidewatch Ward was taken over six months ago.
10:15.680 --> 10:16.680
No.
10:16.680 --> 10:17.680
Okay.
10:17.680 --> 10:18.680
Okay.
10:18.680 --> 10:19.680
So plenty of time there.
10:19.680 --> 10:20.680
Plenty.
10:20.680 --> 10:21.680
Plenty.
10:21.680 --> 10:22.680
Plenty of time there.
10:22.680 --> 10:25.680
So where is something in reaction to that?
10:25.680 --> 10:43.680
I'm going to say that I was brought in, I'm thinking like some kind of attempt to like
10:43.680 --> 10:50.680
erect like a barrier or a shield, you know, to protect the rest of the city.
10:50.680 --> 10:52.680
And it went long.
10:52.680 --> 10:53.680
It went south.
10:53.680 --> 10:54.680
I don't want to do that.
10:54.680 --> 10:55.680
I don't want to do that.
10:55.680 --> 10:56.680
Um.
10:56.680 --> 10:57.680
I don't want to do that.
10:57.680 --> 10:58.680
Um.
10:58.680 --> 10:59.680
Yeah.
10:59.680 --> 11:11.680
Maybe, um, maybe the idea was to, uh, kind of use the, the surrounding, uh, the sea itself
11:11.680 --> 11:18.680
to create like, uh, like a, like a, like a, a, like a, like a, like a wall of water or, you
11:18.680 --> 11:19.680
know what I mean?
11:19.680 --> 11:20.680
Like something.
11:20.680 --> 11:21.680
Um.
11:21.680 --> 11:26.680
And instead it wound up like flooding or tsunami style, like hit.
11:26.680 --> 11:32.680
It didn't necessarily destroy, but you know, wreaked havoc on another part of the city.
11:32.680 --> 11:33.680
Okay.
11:33.680 --> 11:34.680
All right.
11:34.680 --> 11:35.680
Cool.
11:35.680 --> 11:36.680
I like it.
11:36.680 --> 11:37.680
I like it.
11:37.680 --> 11:38.680
Um, all right, Ryan.
11:38.680 --> 11:39.680
Two.
11:39.680 --> 11:40.680
Two.
11:40.680 --> 11:43.680
Man, that was a lot of, that was a lot of action for two.
11:43.680 --> 11:45.680
I was like, I was like, come on, shoot me the 20.
11:45.680 --> 11:46.680
Two.
11:46.680 --> 11:47.680
Two.
11:47.680 --> 11:48.680
Two.
11:48.680 --> 11:49.680
Go ahead and reroll it.
11:49.680 --> 11:50.680
That one we already did.
11:50.680 --> 11:51.680
Yeah.
11:51.680 --> 11:52.680
Two.
11:52.680 --> 11:53.680
Four.
11:53.680 --> 11:54.680
Four.
11:54.680 --> 11:55.680
Yeah.
11:55.680 --> 11:56.680
Get those bad rolls all the way down.
11:56.680 --> 11:57.680
Yeah.
11:57.680 --> 11:58.680
Exactly.
11:58.680 --> 11:59.680
Perfect.
11:59.680 --> 12:00.680
Yeah.
12:00.680 --> 12:01.680
Yeah.
12:01.680 --> 12:02.680
Yeah.
12:02.680 --> 12:03.680
Yeah.
12:03.680 --> 12:04.680
Yeah.
12:04.680 --> 12:05.680
Yeah.
12:05.680 --> 12:06.680
Yeah.
12:06.680 --> 12:07.680
Yeah.
12:07.680 --> 12:08.680
Yeah.
12:08.680 --> 12:09.680
Yeah.
12:09.680 --> 12:10.680
Yeah.
12:10.680 --> 12:11.680
Yeah.
12:11.680 --> 12:12.680
Yeah.
12:12.680 --> 12:13.680
Yeah.
12:13.680 --> 12:14.680
Yeah.
12:14.680 --> 12:15.680
Yeah.
12:15.680 --> 12:16.680
All right.
12:16.680 --> 12:24.680
So Ryan, um, what group of workers or refugees did you protect when a half finished district
12:24.680 --> 12:29.680
collapsed during the building?
12:29.680 --> 12:34.680
Uh, and at this point you can feel free to make anything.
12:34.680 --> 12:35.680
Okay.
12:35.680 --> 12:37.680
So I helped say the ship builders.
12:37.680 --> 12:38.680
Okay.
12:38.680 --> 12:45.680
We're trying to repair and build small ships to get fishing back online after the great,
12:45.680 --> 12:48.680
what do we call this thing?
12:48.680 --> 12:49.680
The flaming retribution.
12:49.680 --> 12:50.680
Retribution.
12:50.680 --> 12:51.680
Yeah.
12:51.680 --> 12:52.680
Yeah.
12:52.680 --> 12:53.680
Yeah.
12:53.680 --> 12:56.680
What, what were, what did you protect them from?
12:56.680 --> 13:01.680
Were they under attack by, what, was it something natural disaster?
13:01.680 --> 13:04.680
Did, um, did some sea monsters do something or?
13:04.680 --> 13:11.680
Uh, metal, a magic metal shield that helped them not burn down from the flames that were
13:11.680 --> 13:12.680
still persistent.
13:12.680 --> 13:13.680
Okay.
13:13.680 --> 13:15.680
The outskirts so they can go fishing.
13:15.680 --> 13:16.680
Okay.
13:16.680 --> 13:17.680
Bring food into the village.
13:17.680 --> 13:24.680
So after, after shock, like fire, fire raining, fire things are still kind of out the outskirts
13:24.680 --> 13:25.680
of the.
13:25.680 --> 13:26.680
Okay.
13:26.680 --> 13:27.680
Yeah.
13:27.680 --> 13:28.680
Cool.
13:28.680 --> 13:29.680
Yep.
13:29.680 --> 13:30.680
I like it.
13:30.680 --> 13:31.680
Shock way where the.
13:31.680 --> 13:32.680
Nice piece of it.
13:32.680 --> 13:33.680
So they want to go fishing.
13:33.680 --> 13:34.680
So they didn't bring home food.
13:34.680 --> 13:35.680
Awesome.
13:35.680 --> 13:36.680
Perfect.
13:36.680 --> 13:37.680
Okay.
13:37.680 --> 13:39.680
So that's the first part.
13:39.680 --> 13:43.680
Now we've got the, now we've got the connections piece.
13:43.680 --> 13:48.680
So I'm going to go ahead and start off with, uh, Ian and Dave.
13:48.680 --> 13:49.680
Mm-hmm.
13:49.680 --> 13:51.680
Um, one of you roll a d20.
13:51.680 --> 13:52.680
Go for it.
13:55.680 --> 13:56.680
20.
13:56.680 --> 13:57.680
Oh, man.
13:57.680 --> 13:58.680
Starting stronger.
13:58.680 --> 14:00.680
He's going to get a plus one to one of our stats, right?
14:00.680 --> 14:02.680
That's a perfect way to set it up here.
14:02.680 --> 14:03.680
No.
14:03.680 --> 14:04.680
Um, okay.
14:04.680 --> 14:12.680
So Ian and Dave, your characters were handpicked by the same counselor or guild master for your
14:12.680 --> 14:14.680
courage in defending others.
14:14.680 --> 14:23.680
What past deed earned their faith in both of you that, and what mission did they entrust
14:23.680 --> 14:24.680
you with now?
14:24.680 --> 14:25.680
Hmm.
14:25.680 --> 14:26.680
Hmm.
14:28.680 --> 14:30.680
What past deed.
14:30.680 --> 14:31.680
Hmm.
14:33.680 --> 14:35.680
How long have you been a paladin?
14:35.680 --> 14:38.680
I've been a paladin since I was, since I was 13.
14:38.680 --> 14:39.680
Okay.
14:39.680 --> 14:40.680
So it's entirely possible that you were-
14:40.680 --> 14:43.680
I've been, I've been training under, training to be a paladin.
14:43.680 --> 14:44.680
Yeah, to be a paladin.
14:44.680 --> 14:45.680
Yeah.
14:45.680 --> 14:50.680
So it's entirely possible you were at the original, like, for some reason you were at the dock
14:50.680 --> 14:52.680
during the original Tidewatch invasion?
14:52.680 --> 14:53.680
Yeah.
14:53.680 --> 14:54.680
It's possible.
14:54.680 --> 15:00.680
I like the idea, and tell me what you think of this, of like, we pretty visibly beat the
15:00.680 --> 15:05.680
shit out of some big monster that was, like, during the invasion that nobody else sort
15:05.680 --> 15:07.680
of had the courage to face.
15:07.680 --> 15:09.680
We're like, nah, we got this.
15:09.680 --> 15:10.680
Yeah, I could, I could see that.
15:10.680 --> 15:11.680
Okay.
15:11.680 --> 15:12.680
I was thinking about maybe helping a famine, but yeah, I could definitely see that.
15:12.680 --> 15:13.680
Yep.
15:13.680 --> 15:14.680
Yeah.
15:14.680 --> 15:15.680
Yeah, I know, I, I, I would do, yeah, I would do that.
15:15.680 --> 15:16.680
Yeah.
15:16.680 --> 15:17.680
All right.
15:17.680 --> 15:22.680
And then what have they chose, what was the second part of the question?
15:22.680 --> 15:25.680
And what mission did they entrust you with now?
15:25.680 --> 15:32.680
What side quest has the, has the counselor entrusted both of you with?
15:32.680 --> 15:49.680
I'm so tempted to say, recovering some treasure maps, but I'm not gonna say that.
15:49.680 --> 15:51.680
Do you have, do you have a mission in mind, Ian?
15:51.680 --> 15:52.680
Yeah, I think I do.
15:52.680 --> 15:53.680
Yeah.
15:53.680 --> 15:56.680
Like, like, how big is this island?
15:56.680 --> 15:57.680
Huge.
15:57.680 --> 15:58.680
Huge?
15:58.680 --> 15:59.680
Yeah.
15:59.680 --> 16:02.680
Is there, like, another, like, farming town out there?
16:02.680 --> 16:03.680
Like, is that having monster problems?
16:03.680 --> 16:09.680
Um, well, it's not, like, there, there's a refuge, like, there's a refugee quarter,
16:09.680 --> 16:10.680
and it's not really a quarter.
16:10.680 --> 16:13.680
It's so much as, like, just surrounding the city.
16:13.680 --> 16:14.680
Uh-huh.
16:14.680 --> 16:19.680
So there's, like, basically just this huge ring of tent, uh, of, like, tent slums.
16:19.680 --> 16:20.680
Slums.
16:20.680 --> 16:21.680
Yeah.
16:21.680 --> 16:25.680
Uh, it's more or less, I wanted to, I wanted to help some, uh, food crisis, like, like,
16:25.680 --> 16:26.680
like, like.
16:26.680 --> 16:30.680
Well, so here's, here's something at least to consider with this.
16:30.680 --> 16:37.680
The, the concept of this, of this specific game is for you to be going into this, into
16:37.680 --> 16:39.680
this ghost quarter.
16:39.680 --> 16:40.680
Ah.
16:40.680 --> 16:47.680
This, the, the ghost, the tide watch ward, and, and start clearing it out and, you know.
16:47.680 --> 16:48.680
Okay.
16:48.680 --> 16:49.680
Mm-hmm.
16:49.680 --> 16:52.680
So, the mission should be something to do with the tide watch ward.
16:52.680 --> 16:53.680
Okay.
16:53.680 --> 16:54.680
Really.
16:54.680 --> 16:55.680
Mm-hmm.
16:55.680 --> 16:57.680
If you're going to have it work into this adventure.
16:57.680 --> 16:58.680
Okay.
16:58.680 --> 16:59.680
Wait.
16:59.680 --> 17:00.680
Mm-hmm.
17:00.680 --> 17:01.680
Wait.
17:01.680 --> 17:05.680
I, I, I think, can, can we make a, can they make a minor demon lord or something?
17:05.680 --> 17:06.680
Yeah.
17:06.680 --> 17:10.680
Yeah, can we, like, we had to, we had to face a, a hidden demon that was summoned.
17:10.680 --> 17:11.680
Summon.
17:11.680 --> 17:12.680
Okay.
17:12.680 --> 17:13.680
Summon.
17:13.680 --> 17:14.680
Okay.
17:14.680 --> 17:15.680
Summon before everything went down.
17:15.680 --> 17:18.680
There's apparently a demon that was summoned and it fled to the tide watch ward.
17:18.680 --> 17:19.680
Ooh.
17:19.680 --> 17:21.680
And it's your jobs to go and destroy it.
17:21.680 --> 17:23.680
I like this plane.
17:23.680 --> 17:24.680
So.
17:24.680 --> 17:26.680
Why did I agree to this?
17:26.680 --> 17:27.680
I don't know.
17:27.680 --> 17:29.680
Hey, I thought it was cool.
17:29.680 --> 17:30.680
No, it is cool.
17:30.680 --> 17:31.680
It's a cool idea.
17:31.680 --> 17:34.680
I'm just saying, why did my character agree to this?
17:34.680 --> 17:35.680
It seems like.
17:35.680 --> 17:36.680
Cause it's barbarian.
17:36.680 --> 17:37.680
Barbarian smash.
17:37.680 --> 17:38.680
Yeah.
17:38.680 --> 17:39.680
That's true.
17:39.680 --> 17:40.680
Yeah.
17:40.680 --> 17:41.680
Yeah.
17:41.680 --> 17:42.680
Alright, um.
17:42.680 --> 17:43.680
They're damage resistance demon, right?
17:43.680 --> 17:44.680
Yeah.
17:44.680 --> 17:45.680
Right.
17:46.680 --> 17:49.680
Alright, uh, Ryan and Ramsey.
17:49.680 --> 17:50.680
I'll call.
17:50.680 --> 17:52.680
One of you guys, roll a 20.
17:52.680 --> 17:53.680
What?
17:53.680 --> 17:54.680
Two.
17:54.680 --> 17:55.680
Two.
17:55.680 --> 17:56.680
Man.
17:56.680 --> 17:57.680
You are strong.
17:57.680 --> 17:59.680
You like those twos, Ryan.
17:59.680 --> 18:03.680
Well, you, you are using, you are using my dice and those d20s.
18:03.680 --> 18:06.680
Those d20s are notoriously bad moves.
18:06.680 --> 18:11.680
So, um, it's probably something I shouldn't be admitting to as the GM.
18:11.680 --> 18:12.680
Um.
18:12.680 --> 18:14.680
You can roll them as the DM.
18:14.680 --> 18:15.680
Yeah.
18:15.680 --> 18:16.680
I'm sure.
18:16.680 --> 18:17.680
Um, okay.
18:17.680 --> 18:18.680
So, two.
18:18.680 --> 18:25.680
You worked side by side rescuing survivors from a capsized ferry near the harbor mouth.
18:26.680 --> 18:30.680
Who's quick thinking saved the most lives?
18:30.680 --> 18:33.680
And, how did you celebrate after?
18:33.680 --> 18:34.680
Ah.
18:34.680 --> 18:36.680
I'm surprised you.
18:36.680 --> 18:45.680
We went back to the, the underground tavern was still intact and the bartender was still
18:45.680 --> 18:46.680
there to serve us drinks.
18:46.680 --> 18:47.680
Alright.
18:47.680 --> 18:48.680
That's how we celebrated.
18:48.680 --> 18:49.680
Uh huh.
18:49.680 --> 18:50.680
Sounds good.
18:50.680 --> 18:51.680
Alright.
18:51.680 --> 18:54.680
That the celebration was determined before the deed.
18:54.680 --> 18:55.680
Well, obviously.
18:55.680 --> 18:56.680
That's the first part.
18:56.680 --> 18:57.680
That's the most important part.
18:57.680 --> 18:58.680
Is the celebration.
18:58.680 --> 19:01.680
So, we found the, the last remaining underground tavern.
19:01.680 --> 19:02.680
So, out of.
19:02.680 --> 19:03.680
Who's quick thinking?
19:03.680 --> 19:04.680
Yeah.
19:04.680 --> 19:05.680
Who's quick thinking?
19:05.680 --> 19:08.680
Shaved were rescuing people to the ferry?
19:08.680 --> 19:09.680
Yes.
19:09.680 --> 19:10.680
I would imagine.
19:10.680 --> 19:15.680
It's probably going to be more of a ranger than a cleric.
19:15.680 --> 19:16.680
Alright.
19:16.680 --> 19:17.680
Uh.
19:17.680 --> 19:18.680
Whew.
19:18.680 --> 19:23.680
As far as, you know, if you plopped the ferry.
19:23.680 --> 19:24.680
I don't know.
19:24.680 --> 19:25.680
Do you have anything in mine?
19:25.680 --> 19:26.680
Specifically.
19:26.680 --> 19:27.680
Um.
19:27.680 --> 19:28.680
Hmm.
19:28.680 --> 19:29.680
Oh.
19:29.680 --> 19:30.680
Oh.
19:30.680 --> 19:31.680
Oh.
19:31.680 --> 19:32.680
Oh.
19:32.680 --> 19:33.680
Oh.
19:33.680 --> 19:34.680
Oh.
19:34.680 --> 19:35.680
Oh.
19:35.680 --> 19:36.680
Oh.
19:36.680 --> 19:37.680
Oh.
19:37.680 --> 19:38.680
Oh.
19:38.680 --> 19:39.680
Oh.
19:39.680 --> 19:40.680
Oh.
19:40.680 --> 19:41.680
Oh.
19:41.680 --> 19:43.680
Ryan the ranger did amazing things.
19:43.680 --> 19:44.680
Yep.
19:44.680 --> 19:45.680
With the ferry.
19:45.680 --> 19:50.680
And the, and the cleric supported.
19:50.680 --> 19:52.680
What's up your skill list, Ryan?
19:52.680 --> 19:53.680
Yeah.
19:53.680 --> 19:57.680
So I can do, uh, insight.
19:57.680 --> 20:02.680
Read this thing here.
20:02.680 --> 20:04.680
No one needs glasses at this table.
20:04.680 --> 20:05.680
Nope.
20:05.680 --> 20:06.680
Nope.
20:06.680 --> 20:07.680
Everyone here is not.
20:07.680 --> 20:08.680
Investigation.
20:08.680 --> 20:09.680
Persuasion.
20:09.680 --> 20:10.680
I think that's what that says.
20:10.680 --> 20:11.680
Light of hand.
20:11.680 --> 20:12.680
Okay.
20:12.680 --> 20:17.680
I just wondered if there was a skill that we could weave into that.
20:17.680 --> 20:18.680
Well.
20:18.680 --> 20:21.680
I mean, like, you could have decided it was good.
20:21.680 --> 20:25.680
Decided it was good to, like, collapse the mast or something.
20:25.680 --> 20:27.680
And, you know, make it like a bridge.
20:27.680 --> 20:28.680
Yeah.
20:28.680 --> 20:29.680
There you go.
20:29.680 --> 20:31.680
From the sinking ferry to land.
20:31.680 --> 20:32.680
That works.
20:32.680 --> 20:33.680
Is it alright?
20:33.680 --> 20:34.680
Yeah.
20:34.680 --> 20:40.680
How did, uh, how did, how did the cleric fit into that?
20:40.680 --> 20:41.680
Um.
20:41.680 --> 20:42.680
Good.
20:42.680 --> 20:43.680
Good.
20:43.680 --> 20:44.680
Question.
20:44.680 --> 20:45.680
He prayed.
20:45.680 --> 20:46.680
Just like.
20:46.680 --> 20:55.680
Oh, that's a pretty, that's a pretty easy answer.
20:55.680 --> 20:56.680
Um.
20:56.680 --> 20:57.680
Um.
20:57.680 --> 20:59.680
Turned water to stone?
20:59.680 --> 21:00.680
It was.
21:00.680 --> 21:03.680
Uh, it was at night.
21:03.680 --> 21:04.680
The light.
21:04.680 --> 21:06.680
So, for one thing, yes.
21:06.680 --> 21:13.680
I, I was able to, uh, provide, uh, to buy the light, uh, to, to help.
21:13.680 --> 21:14.680
Um.
21:14.680 --> 21:18.680
And then also, uh, you know, feeling and taking care of the injured afterwards.
21:18.680 --> 21:19.680
Yeah.
21:19.680 --> 21:20.680
Yeah.
21:20.680 --> 21:21.680
Mostly.
21:21.680 --> 21:22.680
Um.
21:22.680 --> 21:31.680
I, I will say that in our celebrations, though, that, um, my character is Xander, who I also,
21:31.680 --> 21:42.680
uh, due to the mishap, uh, with the, the ritual, um, behind his back, uh, people have started
21:42.680 --> 21:45.680
referring to him as Flooded Wrager.
21:45.680 --> 21:46.680
Okay.
21:46.680 --> 21:57.680
Anyway, um, Xander is very stoic, and as he got drunk with you that night, um, you realize
21:57.680 --> 22:10.680
that it is less stoicism and more just being withdrawn and being, um, melancholy.
22:10.680 --> 22:16.680
Well, it comes across to stoicism because he's kind of a weird divine looking dude.
22:16.680 --> 22:19.680
So he's a depressed cleric?
22:19.680 --> 22:20.680
Yup.
22:20.680 --> 22:21.680
Okay.
22:21.680 --> 22:22.680
And he got quite drunk.
22:22.680 --> 22:23.680
That's correct.
22:23.680 --> 22:28.680
That's the amount of beards that I was taking, but I'm seven foot one and 350 pounds.
22:28.680 --> 22:29.680
Oh, man.
22:29.680 --> 22:30.680
So.
22:30.680 --> 22:31.680
Jesus.
22:31.680 --> 22:32.680
I'm a big dude.
22:32.680 --> 22:33.680
Ryan Adler.
22:33.680 --> 22:34.680
I'm a big orc.
22:34.680 --> 22:35.680
So.
22:35.680 --> 22:36.680
Nice.
22:36.680 --> 22:37.680
Very small over here.
22:37.680 --> 22:38.680
All right.
22:38.680 --> 22:39.680
Cool.
22:39.680 --> 22:40.680
So.
22:40.680 --> 22:41.680
Who's?
22:41.680 --> 22:42.680
So I'm about to say change this in.
22:42.680 --> 22:43.680
Well.
22:43.680 --> 22:44.680
He's, he's an orc.
22:44.680 --> 22:46.680
So he's gonna be tall.
22:46.680 --> 22:47.680
Um.
22:47.680 --> 22:48.680
We.
22:48.680 --> 22:49.680
Like three and a half feet.
22:49.680 --> 22:50.680
Yeah.
22:50.680 --> 22:51.680
Fine.
22:51.680 --> 22:52.680
We have no humans here.
22:52.680 --> 22:53.680
So nobody's actually human size.
22:53.680 --> 22:54.680
I don't think.
22:54.680 --> 22:55.680
Um.
22:55.680 --> 22:56.680
Well.
22:56.680 --> 22:57.680
The elf might be.
22:57.680 --> 22:58.680
Yeah.
22:58.680 --> 22:59.680
The elf.
22:59.680 --> 23:00.680
Yeah.
23:00.680 --> 23:01.680
Yeah.
23:01.680 --> 23:02.680
Um.
23:02.680 --> 23:05.680
But, uh, Derek and Jason, why don't you roll a d20?
23:05.680 --> 23:06.680
Go ahead, sir.
23:06.680 --> 23:07.680
That's it.
23:07.680 --> 23:08.680
Ten.
23:08.680 --> 23:09.680
Ten.
23:09.680 --> 23:10.680
Oh my god.
23:10.680 --> 23:11.680
All right.
23:11.680 --> 23:18.680
You shared command of a volunteer squad restoring order after a magical storm.
23:18.680 --> 23:24.680
How did your different strengths make you an unstoppable team?
23:26.680 --> 23:27.680
Monk Mechanist.
23:27.680 --> 23:28.680
Go.
23:30.680 --> 23:31.680
Okay.
23:31.680 --> 23:32.680
Okay.
23:32.680 --> 23:33.680
We shared command of a what?
23:33.680 --> 23:34.680
Squad.
23:34.680 --> 23:35.680
A squad of volunteers.
23:35.680 --> 23:36.680
Okay.
23:36.680 --> 23:39.680
During a storm.
23:39.680 --> 23:40.680
Yep.
23:40.680 --> 23:41.680
Yep.
23:41.680 --> 23:42.680
Yep.
23:42.680 --> 23:43.680
Well.
23:43.680 --> 23:44.680
Um.
23:44.680 --> 23:45.680
Charisma's not my strong suit.
23:45.680 --> 23:46.680
Yeah.
23:46.680 --> 23:47.680
No.
23:47.680 --> 23:48.680
So.
23:48.680 --> 23:49.680
Nope.
23:49.680 --> 23:50.680
Command is.
23:50.680 --> 23:51.680
You lead by example.
23:51.680 --> 23:52.680
Yeah.
23:52.680 --> 23:53.680
We lead by.
23:53.680 --> 23:54.680
Yep.
23:54.680 --> 23:56.680
So, um.
23:56.680 --> 23:58.680
This storm.
23:58.680 --> 24:01.680
We're, we're, obviously we're just like caught out or.
24:01.680 --> 24:02.680
Yeah.
24:02.680 --> 24:07.680
There, there are a number of magical storms that have started showing up throughout, throughout
24:07.680 --> 24:10.680
the, uh, past year.
24:10.680 --> 24:11.680
Um.
24:11.680 --> 24:16.680
The worst of which, being involved with that constant storm that's over at the Tidewatch
24:16.680 --> 24:17.680
Ward.
24:17.680 --> 24:18.680
But.
24:18.680 --> 24:19.680
Okay.
24:19.680 --> 24:21.680
There are a bunch of other ones that pop up from time to time.
24:21.680 --> 24:22.680
Okay.
24:22.680 --> 24:36.680
So, um, I can do pretty good at like making constructions from my, my stone heritage.
24:36.680 --> 24:37.680
Okay.
24:37.680 --> 24:38.680
Um.
24:38.680 --> 24:47.680
So, I imagine I start to build like, you know, a refuge for the group of people.
24:47.680 --> 24:48.680
Okay.
24:48.680 --> 24:50.680
That we can outlast the storm.
24:50.680 --> 24:57.680
Not so much like push through it, but you know, like bunker down and, and hold it out.
24:57.680 --> 24:58.680
Um.
24:58.680 --> 24:59.680
But.
24:59.680 --> 25:04.680
In order to do that, I would need, you know, some amount of materials.
25:04.680 --> 25:08.680
And a monk seems like he's fast, right?
25:08.680 --> 25:09.680
Yeah.
25:09.680 --> 25:10.680
Yeah.
25:10.680 --> 25:11.680
And a help.
25:11.680 --> 25:12.680
Perfect.
25:12.680 --> 25:14.680
I also have a little bit of magic too.
25:14.680 --> 25:15.680
Well, even better.
25:15.680 --> 25:16.680
Yeah.
25:16.680 --> 25:20.680
He is, he does have cloud heritage, which means he has, he has a cantrip and he has access
25:20.680 --> 25:24.680
to a cantrip and he has access to a cantrip and will eventually get a first level spell.
25:24.680 --> 25:25.680
So.
25:25.680 --> 25:26.680
Okay.
25:26.680 --> 25:27.680
Um.
25:27.680 --> 25:28.680
So he's a magical monk.
25:28.680 --> 25:29.680
Okay.
25:29.680 --> 25:30.680
Perfect.
25:30.680 --> 25:31.680
Perfect.
25:31.680 --> 25:32.680
All right.
25:32.680 --> 25:37.680
There's some sort of, some sort of like synergy where like you're building.
25:37.680 --> 25:38.680
Yeah.
25:38.680 --> 25:39.680
Yeah.
25:39.680 --> 25:40.680
Yeah.
25:40.680 --> 25:41.680
Yeah.
25:41.680 --> 25:42.680
Yeah.
25:42.680 --> 25:43.680
He's providing magical and, and physical support to get you there.
25:43.680 --> 25:46.680
Just imagine with Mickey Mouse and Fantasia where he's like.
25:46.680 --> 25:47.680
Yeah.
25:47.680 --> 25:48.680
Yeah.
25:48.680 --> 25:49.680
Yup.
25:49.680 --> 25:50.680
No.
25:50.680 --> 25:51.680
All right.
25:51.680 --> 25:52.680
Cool.
25:52.680 --> 25:58.680
Well, um, I was going to have everybody answer one more question, but we have three minutes
25:58.680 --> 25:59.680
before 10.
25:59.680 --> 26:02.680
So, uh, we'll just call it at that.
26:02.680 --> 26:08.680
Um, I do have a little bit of homework, but hopefully it's not all that bad.
26:08.680 --> 26:17.680
Um, if you guys can think about like two contacts, people not in this group that you,
26:17.680 --> 26:25.680
um, that your character is connected to, whether it's a rival, a friend, um, so, you know,
26:25.680 --> 26:31.680
you know, a, a shop worker that a shop owner that you constantly go back and that you constantly
26:31.680 --> 26:33.680
hang out at their place or whatever.
26:33.680 --> 26:39.680
Um, just come up with something that, that kind of connects your, your character to the
26:39.680 --> 26:40.680
world.
26:40.680 --> 26:43.680
Do not feel like you have to have that completely fleshed out.
26:43.680 --> 26:50.680
You can come, you can come to me with a basic concept of like, you know, say, you
26:50.680 --> 26:55.680
know, you want to be connected to an April O'Neil kind of person or whatever.
26:55.680 --> 26:59.680
You know, if you've got a pop culture reference for your contact, that's perfectly fine.
26:59.680 --> 27:04.680
Um, so I want you to feel like you have to build out this entire backstory for them.
27:04.680 --> 27:11.680
Um, also, yeah, if you, as you're building out your, or as you're at, before the next
27:11.680 --> 27:17.680
session, if you have any ideas about additional backstory things that you would like for your
27:17.680 --> 27:24.680
character to have, um, please do, um, throw those out on discord or let me know about them.
27:24.680 --> 27:33.680
Um, I, when, when I'm building, when I'm building these adventures and, and in the world, I actively
27:33.680 --> 27:39.680
try to incorporate people's backstories into the actual story itself.
27:39.680 --> 27:43.680
So the more information I have, the more I can do that.
27:43.680 --> 27:49.680
And the more fun and engaging, it'll be for you to see your character actually make an impact
27:49.680 --> 27:51.680
on, in, in, on their stuff.
27:51.680 --> 27:57.680
So, um, if, if you, if you're into that, feel free to send that to me.
27:57.680 --> 27:59.680
If you don't send it to me, that's fine.
27:59.680 --> 28:00.680
We'll still have fun.
28:00.680 --> 28:02.680
We'll still play a game and it'll be a blast.
28:02.680 --> 28:05.680
So don't, don't feel like you have to do that.
28:05.680 --> 28:12.680
But if that's something that you think will be really fun, then just give me the info so I can do it.
28:12.680 --> 28:16.680
Yeah, I'm going to be, I'm going to be looking for more of my backstory.
28:16.680 --> 28:17.680
Oh yeah, absolutely.
28:17.680 --> 28:18.680
Thank you.
