# Transcript
A little bit of a bright time.
Do you remember what the other half map is? Is it still on the pirate ship?
I mean, I imagine this captain guy has it. He's getting off the moon, actually.
Or it's on the ship. You wanted to burn that down anyways.
It's true. So just some things that, uh,
Lotypey probably has it on, though.
So you guys are really, you guys are focused on the map, rightly so,
because he's very focused on the map, but you don't even know what this map is going on.
Yeah, I don't know. Nope. Not an idea.
So nobody's really got a clue about what this thing is.
And you just know that pirates want it.
Uh-huh.
So, yeah, we do know if I'm wrong, but we do know that the temple seems to be
somehow connected to the curse, right?
Was our thought?
Yeah, there was. Yeah.
Okay. So there are a couple of things that have happened, uh,
just to spend forever.
Yeah.
Um, so first off, you know that the temple itself was,
there was a big flash in the temple when, um, that came from the temple.
Yeah.
Um, when the, um, the Tidewatch Ward was overtaken by monsters.
It was like, there's this big flash, and then monsters started surging into the, uh,
into the, uh, Tidewatch Ward.
Um, you do also know that there is a continual theme of a statement around a pearl that has been,
that has been stated in multiple places.
Um, not the least of which being in the Salty Dog, where you guys found the pirate gold and the pirate treasure.
There was, there was something about a pearl in there.
Um, you know that where you found the stuff that you, where you found your magic items and things,
that was a pirate horde, but it was a pirate horde that hadn't been used in a while.
Um, these pirates are definitely, have definitely not been like,
they, they've been surging in, but they weren't as deep in as, as the Salty Doggy.
So this is a different wave of pirates from that wave of pirates, you would suspect.
I don't know if you guys, if anybody had inferred that, but you know.
Yeah, I was trying to, I was trying to do that, but that's something that your, your characters could have inferred.
Yeah. Okay.
Um, so like, cause that was like an old, it was, it was months old.
These are fresh pirates.
So might not even be the same pirates, might not even be the same pirate group.
You don't know, um, but you do know that they're looking for a map.
There's been talk about a pearl there, the, the, he did not correct you when you said that you,
that you were going into the temple.
Well, I noticed.
He in fact reinforced it.
He did in fact reinforce it.
So those are the things that, you know, you might have an opportunity here, depending on how you play your cards,
to be able to gain additional information about like what it is that these guys are seeking.
Um, and you still have an opportunity to be, uh, to be able to, um,
in, uh, it, to be able to work out a deal with them.
Yeah.
It's just your first bid.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Fake.
So those are all things that you guys should be able to.
I, as a player, know things and know how to communicate them.
Jezric.
With his negative one.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
He did not communicate well.
Well, Derek, here, here's, here's an opportunity though.
Cause there are addition.
There are other players or there are other characters, um, in here that have better charisma
scores or might have a better opportunity of being able to help things along.
Yeah.
So you as a player and maybe they don't know how to approach it.
Yeah.
You as a player can feel free to kind of coach people through.
Yeah.
I, I, I, I, I, I had these at Chris, bro.
Yeah.
So like, just because he wants to get the map, if we could convince him that it would
be beneficial to take us along instead of just like, oh, we'll meet you at the end
and you'll betray us then.
Like, it's a lot easier to be part of the group and get what we want than, you know,
just, you know, try to, if we could be invited to come and help with the challenges, that's
a whole lot easier than following them secretly and, you know, having to worry about all that
other stuff.
That's true.
And, and also, even if you don't have a really good charisma, it doesn't mean that you can't
do something that would help tell that story for the person who's like, Hey, we might be
useful to you.
So like, um, for example, little John, like your background is a maker background.
You are somebody who builds things and who, and who can do that sort of stuff.
So like, if, if like, say, Arthur is making a play for, um, being like, we would be useful.
Why don't you take this along and let's put the treasure 50 50 or something like that.
Yeah.
Um, then you might be able to be like, yeah, and this is how I can be helpful.
And basically, yeah, like, yeah, that's where I was trying to go.
Like showing, showing, showing our strengths, uh, what we can do.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What we can do to help them.
Yeah.
Okay.
That's, that's why, that's, that's, that's why I wanted to show our strengths to show them
how strong we are.
We can help them get.
Okay.
Yeah, no, absolutely.
That is definitely something that you can do.
Um, so how would Arthur approach that?
Hmm.
What's, what'd be hard to destroy?
Destroy, but hard to destroy that thing, Captain, with my 18 plus strength.
Well, I, like, are you trying to be helpful or are you trying to be intimidating?
I'm trying to show helpful.
Cause just, just for the record, the only thing that he's heard so far is why don't we share,
why don't you do your part, we'll do our part, and then we'll fight it out at the end.
So if you just follow it up with, like, blowing something up, you're reinforcing that you are an aggressor, not a helpful person.
Okay.
So, the, so, like, what, what would you do to show yourself to be, or to communicate to them that they're being, that you're being helpful?
Cause you can actually, like, because you've got a good charisma, you can talk it out.
You can be like, can we join forces?
Yeah, can we go, okay.
My idea, I'm going to, does anyone look injured?
Any of the pirates look, or they're very fresh?
Or, or, or.
Um, I don't think anybody specifically looks injured.
However, however, all of them.
What are we?
Yeah, that's a thing for scurvy.
Yeah, that's nice.
Does anybody look sick?
Yeah, fantasy scurvy.
It's ten or under somebody's neck.
Does anybody look sick or anything?
Oh, everybody should see.
Um, no, but, also, um, also, Ian, your character, your character has a childhood friend who's standing right there.
Okay.
So, even though you guys didn't leave on the best of terms, you have a history.
You can lean on that.
Okay, okay.
Yeah, that's what I'm going, that's what I'm going to do.
Um, basically, the, the, wait, he should know my strengths.
My strength of a friend should know, basically, how strong I should be.
Right?
That is correct.
And he knows, so, I'm going to emphasize to him how, how we took, I'm going to, I'm going to get back to a story on.
So, like, we had, like, we had a, we had a hunt, and we, and how useful I was.
Okay.
That, that, that, we had, we had a score when we were younger, and I, how useful I was to help him and you out.
Okay.
So, we've got the how, but you're not actually making any proposals at this point.
You're just, like, reminiscing with him, going, you remember how awesome I was back in the day?
Yes.
So, actually, turn that into a, we would like to team up.
Yeah, we'd like to.
Sort of, sort of, sort of thing.
So.
Yeah, that's, that's, we would like to team up.
You remember how useful we were, how useful I was back in the day.
Okay.
Can you explain why he's so passive, why he's so, so antisocial?
Ah.
Because.
You, you, you, you, you've got to cover up for his mistake.
Because he, because he's mad at, mad at Moraine.
For something, I believe.
And he's.
He's a big old man.
He's a big old man.
Okay, don't, so, what I'm hearing here, correct me if I'm wrong, you're saying, don't listen
to bitter old man, we want to, we want to, we want to, we want to join up and, and not
join the pirates, but we want to work with you.
Yes.
In order to be able to get, in order to be able to get a, a cut of the treasure.
Cut of the treasure.
Um.
And, and.
And remember how cool I.
Yeah.
Okay.
Roll a 20.
Let's do it.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
That's definitely.
That works.
We'll take it.
Okay.
So, what's, what am I doing?
Roll your 20.
Roll your 20, and then we'll add your persuasion to it.
Add my persuasion to it.
Okay.
Plus two.
Persuasion.
Done one more.
Yeah.
It's the one that has the hands shaking.
Okay.
Wait.
My persuasion.
Oh.
My persuasion is.
Ah.
That's your save.
That's my save.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Here we go.
Wait.
I'm putting you in timeout.
Ah.
He gets a luck.
He failed a roll.
Oh, you're right.
Oh.
I sure do.
It was a mission critical, or it was a strategic roll.
Oh.
Deal.
I'll trade you three luck, and you give me one.
I got 16.
You got 16.
All right.
Is that with your, adding your...
Yeah, that's adding my plus two.
All right.
Cool, cool, cool.
Cool.
So, Arthur, you look at Kaelryx.
You, well, you look at the captain, but you're also kind of like side-eyeing Kaelryx.
And you are explaining that, you know, you explain, like, Xander is just a little bit moody at the moment.
Yeah.
He doesn't mean anything by it.
And you're also, like, I'm a...
I'm basically...
And I, you know, in that person.
Basically, also, basically, I'm also explaining that story to him, how strong I was doing, how useful and strong I was doing that, doing that, doing that story.
Um, and you are able to convince, um, the pirate captain, um, that, uh, you are able, um, you're, you're able to, um, be helpful in this situation.
Um, and he's like, well, we'll, we'll take you.
What about these others?
Hmm, I, I understand he's, he's a maker.
Yeah.
He's a maker and he, and he, he made, he made a, a spring thing that got over a demon barrier or something.
Yeah.
That.
The, uh, the, uh, the tide, the, the tide, the metal, the metal, uh, barrier that saved the tide from certain death and that kind of stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
So you speak about his exploits, um, which, you know, the captain is, is willing to, is willing to accept.
Um, this, you know, what are you, and then he, he's, he's, he looks over, he looks over at this guy with his face.
Flaming crossbow, mechanized flaming crossbow and says, I can see the value of him.
I love me.
We need some motherfuckers.
Obviously we need the, we need the map.
So the keeper of the map will have to come along and we can, we can deal with one more grumpy old man.
Where is it we're going?
Going on.
You already know we're headed to the temple.
Temple of, uh, Moraine.
Moraine.
Can I just pull up my shield?
Whoop.
Whoop.
All right.
He's just nice and character to talk.
He is a priest.
Yeah.
This guy is a priest of Moraine.
He is a priest of Moraine.
So, oops.
So he can't help us navigate that.
Well, we've probably been in that temple before.
Probably he didn't like.
Right.
Well.
Well, that is true.
All the truth.
With that.
Have you ever been in a frenemy relationship with your god before?
Sometimes.
Um, no.
Um, okay.
So.
So after, after, after a fair bit of tense negotiations, you are able to come to terms.
Um, you are all going to, uh, you start off with 50%, end up landing at 20% of the overall proceeds as time goes on.
Um, as you guys negotiate.
Um, and, uh, now you, um, are, uh, the, the pirates have, um, accepted you as part of, not part of their crew, but as accepted, yeah, temp employees.
Uh, oh, weary pirates.
Oh, yeah.
What?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Um, and so after you guys have that discussion, um, the, uh, Captain Thalric, um, looks at Mistral again and says, all right.
I think it's about time we compared notes.
And he pulls a scroll tube out of his coat.
We don't have a map.
Sorry.
I already hired them.
Gotcha.
So excited.
All right.
Uh, yeah, let's sit down and see what.
Okay.
So you guys take the two pieces of the map you put together.
You actually have that other small piece that you picked up in the pirate, uh, pirate booty.
So you got that attached to your map and then you got this other one.
And basically what you see is there is a line that goes directly to the temple of Moraine.
Inside, uh, the temple of Moraine, there is a sub-basement where there's some sort of what, what is referred to as, it was referred to as the gloomways.
It's, it's, it's kind of like some sort of, um, underground surface area.
Um, and you follow, and the map has kind of like a, a, well, it's got a map.
It's got the directions for how to get to an antechamber that's inside, um, that's inside that cave, um, underneath the, um, underneath the temple.
So, and there is something that is marked there as, uh, it, it, it is referred to as, it has a different name, but I'm just going to call it, uh,
I'm going to call it by its, um, street name, I guess, uh, it's, it's called the Pearl of Moraine.
Um, and as you're kind of walking through it, and it's like, you know, we, obviously, he, he basically kind of runs through, like, we need to be in here by, um, by dusk, uh, when the, uh, when the tide is at its highest, right?
At dusk is the highest, is the high tide.
Oh, it would be.
It would be.
It would be.
It would be.
At dusk, when the tide is at its lowest, I, we'll, we'll go with low.
Sure, sure.
Um, I can make up any sort of rules.
Yeah, yeah.
It's my world.
Um, uh, we need to be in there to be able to enter the gloamways.
Uh, once there, we can make it, we, we can make it through the passages to get to the chamber of the pearl.
Um, um, this is a artifact of great power.
Um, it's said to, uh, and he basically kind of gives you a little bit of a, little bit of an idea about, about the background of it.
Uh, he doesn't go too deep into it.
Um, but he says that, um, this is, uh, this is a tool that any sailor would want for, um, any sailor would want and any sailor would benefit from.
Um, especially considering the, the, um, the destruction that we've recently experienced, having something that would help us sail more safely is going to pay, is going to pay back in, in, um, in droves.
Uh, I, I, I, I, I might, I can't afford him that it might be cursed now, because something, because...
Are you going to suggest that the treasure that they're seeking is cursed?
Yes.
To keep them to their face?
I'm, no, I'm throwing these back.
After having, after having, uh, after having negotiated a deal to get, a deal to...
No, I'm throwing the party.
I'm throwing that.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Sorry, I thought you were talking, I thought you were participating in the, in the pirate, the pirate discussion there.
No, no.
Okay, cool.
I'm doing the party that, that might be cursed now, so.
What?
I was wondering how we get 20% for a single magic item.
Do we, like, give them a week down, or?
No.
What?
You will be paid 20% of the overall carry value of the item.
Yes.
But it's priceless.
Ah!
So you get all the money.
20% of infinity is infinity.
Okay.
As you guys are having that conversation, as the pirate, as the pirate captain is kind of having that conversation with you,
and whoever wants to be participating in that can be participating in that.
Um, Kaelritz also, uh, will kind of try and get Arthur's attention a little bit.
Is this all happening in the cove that we, or did we retreat back to?
Okay.
Yeah.
It's still happening in the cove.
You are not invited onto Byra's ship.
Um.
Sorry, that might go anywhere, but that would happen, so.
Yep.
Not so worried.
Um, but, yeah, Kaelritz tries to get Arthur's attention to see if he can, uh, have a word.
Okay.
Oh.
Okay.
Um.
And again, like, whoever wants to be participating can participate, um, he, uh, kind of pulls you aside and says,
Well, I wish we'd met under different circumstances.
Thank you.
Um, I do have something I wanted to talk to you about, uh, something that a do-gooder like you might want to know.
Yep.
We aren't the first group that has gone after this pearl.
Um, in the past, uh, about six months ago, uh, we had another group that went after the pearls.
And they never returned.
When they never returned, we decided to sail over here to see if they decided to point the pearl and run.
And not come back to the, uh, not come back to the, uh, the band.
And we found the Tidewatch Ward in its current state.
It might be a coincidence.
But since this is my hometown, I have a concern.
I can't openly speak about it to my superiors because insubordination is not tolerated.
Um, but, uh, just thought you might want to know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, don't guess, bro.
And with that, you just kind of skedaddles.
Well, as talking is happening, uh, I'm trying to see if I can notice any signs of, uh, this
curse or disease or whatever it is, uh, the pirates.
Okay.
See any scales, coral, I mean, whatever.
See them itching.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, yeah, they, they are remarkably clean.
Mm-hmm.
Um, well, clean for pirates.
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I mean, they, they're pirates, so they're kind of.
Well, you know, weird zombie coral.
Yeah.
They don't have any weird coral things.
Yeah, yeah.
Um, about the only thing that's kind of weird is just more along the lines of, like, the captain.
Yeah, yeah.
But that doesn't look like it's the same.
Right, right, right, right.
Okay.
Uh.
It's not cool.
Interesting.
Uh.
Do, do, do, do, do, do.
Oh.
Yeah.
I, I, I saw, I saw that and.
That, that doesn't mean anything.
I just printed it on the, I, I was just printing on double sides, so.
Okay.
Yeah.
All right.
Um.
So, with that, the, the pirate captain is, uh.
Uh, good to, like, after you investigate the, uh, the actual, uh, maps.
The, the part of the map that you had, Jason, was, um, not the, was not the Glomway, but the actual, like, location of the entrance and how to actually make it into the Glomways.
Um, so, um, so, they, uh, so, you know, you're able to get them into the tunnels and they're able to get you guys all the way to the Pearl.
Um, so, um, is basically how that, how that worked up.
Um.
Anything else that you want to cover that you care about, um, in, in, over the course of the next few hours?
Hmm.
No, I'm good.
I'm good.
I don't need to do anything.
You sure?
Uh, I'm pretty sure.
Can I see the book?
No, it sounds like you're not sure.
No, I'm pretty sure.
No, no, no.
I was thinking about squirrel people, but.
Probably got a pretty valuable use of.
I'm going to say, so, from the sound of it, are we, like, taking a, not necessarily a rest, but, like, we have some hours to kill?
Yeah, so, basically, what's going to happen here is you guys are going to be making camp, um, on the, uh, on the shore here.
Okay.
Um, the pirates are going to go back to their ship, um, and then they will return in the morning for you guys to start moving towards.
Okay, so it's just us hanging out at this point.
Right.
Okay.
Um, so, if, if you have anything that you want to talk to the pirates about, you totally can do that.
There's space for that, but otherwise, you're, you're basically just setting up camp where you're at.
Okay.
Like, a couple days away, right?
Like, we've still.
Right.
Time to travel here.
So, we'll be traveling with the pirates for a good, for a good minute, yeah.
Ah, all right.
Um, so, it seems how it's just us.
Pirates are gone.
Uh, I'm going to get out my artist kit or my artist tools and some chalk and see if, between the group, between all of us, if I can't sketch out what the details of that other half of the map.
Just in case something happens to where we get kind of separated, at least we have.
Okay.
I'm thinking of more than that.
I'm thinking we separate.
We've already, we know where the entrance is.
Yeah.
We know what we're looking for.
Yeah.
So, you guys are just going to, you're feeling like you just want to race.
Be faster than them.
Jezric, you don't have any, like, bombs, do you?
Oh, you guys.
Wrong character.
Hang on.
What is gold value of bomb?
Because if they're going back to their boat, hide a bomb in one of their belts, I have to just, oh my gosh.
Probably not.
I imagine the, I imagine the price is too much.
I mean, I could definitely make some.
Explosives kit.
Just lying around.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I was thinking making one of my orbs of creation into a bomb, but I, the gold cost might be too much.
The original version is in him, Guyver, but then he just won right away.
Oh.
So, he was totally super-fitted by Chuck Norris.
I, I actually think it's going to be, well, there's one, I don't think there's really anything like a bomb in this world currently.
No Molotov cocktails, or?
I mean, there's definitely Molotov cocktails.
We could definitely do something like that.
We have the alcohol, because, you know, we stole it from the bar.
Yeah.
It's going to do it else.
Yeah.
But no, I don't think there's anything.
No.
I'm going to double check to make sure.
There's holy water.
I mean, if I was fifth level.
Yeah.
I mean, if I was fifth level, you know.
Well, sorry, guys.
No, no.
Oh, jeez.
No, no, no, no.
Give me those levels.
Oh, jeez.
But no, I was definitely, once we are alone, I will definitely suggest that, you know, we cut and run, because we know the stuff.
Especially if you can copy a map.
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
So, Jason, for you to be able to copy the map.
Yeah.
So, the way this is going to work is you're going to, regardless of whether or not the information is accurate, you copy a map.
Mm-hmm.
But, we're going to make you, we're going to have you make a roll to determine how accurate you made the map.
Okay.
So, what that is going to be, is it's going to be your calligraphy tools.
Right?
You got calligraphy tools?
Or it's an artist tool?
Artist.
Okay.
So, we're going to use your artist tools, from which that will add a proficiency bonus to, to that.
Is artist tools depth there?
Depth or charisma.
Okay.
Are the associated abilities, so.
So, we'll have you do a dex plus your proficiency bonus plus a d20 roll.
Okay.
Which, even though this is by memory, it then, we'll be rolled.
I'm not going to.
What you got?
That's a d20.
Looks pretty good.
You have eidetic memory.
It's like, you, you, you make the.
I'm a monk for a reason.
You, you paint, or you paint the, uh, the map in there for your friend's benefits, but you've got it sealed with your mind.
You know exactly what this thing looks like.
Reproduce the coffee stains on the map.
Just, it's all there.
Exactly.
Um, so you guys have a full map.
Yep.
Are you cutting and running?
I don't think we should.
I, I, I, I'm going to be, I'm, I'm the type, I'd be honorable to stay with, with the deal we had.
Yeah, but the deal we had is with the sirens.
They're going to try to kill us.
Almost certainly.
Right.
Is there a way to get your friend to join us and then cut and run?
Um.
No, we will not.
My friend would not.
He's a bad guy.
No, I just know him.
He, he would not.
He would not die.
I don't think of how much of a bad guy he is, though.
He might be interested in going for 100% of the bounty.
Oh.
Versus 0%.
I mean, he's middle management.
He's been treated bad.
We might be able to play on that a little bit.
And maybe it's time for him to step up and help lead his own crew.
Yeah.
Ooh, do they have a, do they have a kill boat?
Do they have what?
A kill boat.
I can drive one of those.
So, so he could steal that.
He could cap, you guys could be his crew.
Yeah.
Straw Hat Pirates, right?
Yeah.
The thing that you can do.
Can you hack, can you recruit NPCs?
You can, if you want to.
Um, it's.
Yeah.
It's, I mean, it's not necessarily, uh.
There are no bombs in that book.
Uh-huh.
All right.
Sometimes it's helpful.
Sometimes it's not.
Fair enough.
But, yeah.
You, I mean, really, the great thing about playing an RPG is, you know.
What you want.
Is yourself.
So, if you can think about it.
Well.
Roll high enough.
Then you can do.
Oh.
I do.
So, is there a way to roll to see if we recruit his sidekick to join us to take this tennis?
Well, I imagine he's on the boat now, though.
He is.
Which is a whole nother thing.
Yeah.
So, we've got a map, and we're not on the boat.
Yeah.
And they're on the boat.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If we wanted to, if we wanted to cut and run, I think this would be our only opportunity.
If they actually thought this through, they probably would have had you be on the boat
with them, but they didn't.
So, here we are.
It's that.
Great opportunity.
Yep.
It's that, uh.
It's that threat of burning it down.
Like, we don't want these people near our, near our keels here.
Right?
Right?
We're probably fat for the move across the two days of travel than the pirates, because
the pirates have too many people, right?
They're going to.
Yeah, it's possible that they would, it's possible that they would move slower.
Um.
It is also possible that, you know, they.
We're going to win this pearl and walk out the front door and be like, hey!
Yeah.
Be like the guy at the guy who runs in the car.
That's the whole.
That's the game.
Something tells me.
It's a fleece switch.
Something tells me.
Something tells me.
That's the best.
I don't want to get the impression.
Something tells me we will have to destroy the pearl.
To cure the ward.
Maybe.
My thing is, I don't, I don't care about the pearl as far as, like, it being magic or treasure
or money, like, my whole deal was, one, I don't want them running away from disease in the
mainland, but two, them fighting the zombies alongside of us, or instead of us, is great.
And if we can't run, we're going to serve them that way.
Well, that's ridiculous.
I see.
How dare you!
Do you betray our pact of death?
It's ridiculous!
That's true.
You want to be dead.
Why are you trying to preserve yourself?
No, no, no.
Yes.
But I also want to be successful.
If you don't enjoy it on the way down, then it was all worthless.
I have a good feeling that we will have to destroy the pearl.
Well, the pirates aren't going to want us to do that.
That is true.
Yeah.
That's a good point.
Yeah.
That thing is...
Do you think they'll let you destroy the pearl if you travel with them?
If that thing is cursed, then what caused this?
We're also going to want to take it somewhere else, and that's real bad.
Yep.
All right.
Let's go.
I have a good feeling we will have to destroy the art of sight.
Maybe?
Or I don't think I could cure it or anything from the curse.
Maybe?
I don't know.
I can eat it.
Or we could feed it to our cobalt friend.
He would eat it.
Hey, can I make it?
Okay, question.
Yes.
Answer.
How about you've ever heard of this pearl before?
Because I have...
The Pearl of Moraine.
Do you roll me a history check?
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah, I do have...
I actually have a religion.
Uh...
For...
You specifically, it would need to be a history check.
Okay, history.
And what is my...
For Xander, it could be religion or history.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm going to have to say things.
Yeah.
Yeah, good.
I'm going to be trying to smell in it.
I may have been there when it was created.
Good.
I mean...
Maybe not.
I was here when the old magic was made.
What?
Uh...
Um...
What's that?
Zero.
Ah!
Zero.
You have never heard of this pearl ever in your...
You're not even sure that the pearl exists.
Let's see.
Uh...
21!
Get to...
All right.
Well...
Why you guys are doing good roles?
You...
You didn't know.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
You are familiar with this pearl.
Yep.
Pearl Moraine.
Yep, yep.
Um...
Was actually...
Um...
Something that you...
In fact, do remember.
Oh.
It's at...
It is from your previous life.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Um...
It was something that you almost forgotten.
Yeah.
Um...
It was...
Suppressed.
Um...
Not...
Not...
Consciously.
But it was just kind of like something that was...
Yep.
In the back of your mind.
In a way, your previous life is...
Kind of...
It almost...
Like you remember...
Your death...
And being in your...
And being in the...
In Moraine's world.
But you don't really remember...
It's...
It's almost like your previous life was like shadows.
But this kind of comes to the surface.
Um...
There was a pearl that Moraine had gifted a city with that was a pearl from her...
A pearl from her own necklace.
Um...
About the size of a human head.
It's a pearl.
Um...
It's a...
It has certain special abilities.
Uh...
The...
The specific...
Um...
Specifically, what it does is it calms the waves and storms.
It controls the weather and brings good...
Um...
Good winds...
To...
The area that...
The area that it is a part of.
This pearl was gifted...
To the city and the city...
Put it at its very foundations.
And that...
And the foundations of the city...
Being powered by this pearl...
Gave the city endless prosperity.
Um...
And always gave them...
Always gave it...
Good...
Good winds...
Um...
The city...
Was...
Um...
The city was the city of Penmaris.
Um...
And as you kind of think about this...
And things start...
Coalescing...
Um...
Um...
You realize that...
The pearl...
Um...
Controls...
Controls...
The weather...
And it brings...
Good weather...
Good...
Breezes...
Um...
It protects the city...
From harm...
Okay...
And the city of Penmaris...
Was part of a peninsula...
That was completely and utterly destroyed...
Outside of...
That city...
Yeah...
Without the cities and islands...
Yeah...
You also remember...
That when the pearl was taken...
Or when the...
When...
Not when the pearl was taken...
I gave way too much...
Uh...
When the...
Uh...
When the...
Um...
The Tidewatch Ward...
Was overrun...
There were earthquakes...
And...
You...
And you also have noticed...
That in the Tidewatch Ward...
Specifically...
There are lots of spaces...
Where the water itself...
Is kind of...
Overtaking the land...
And you think...
That might have something to do...
The pearl...
So...
The pearl itself...
May...
In fact...
Be sustaining the city...
As it is...
Yeah...
And if it were to be removed...
Yeah...
The city...
May very well...
To the sea...
Will be no island...
Yup...
Okay...
So...
That's your 21...
Congratulations...
Yup...
Yup...
I will...
I'll share that...
Yup...
We...
Can't...
Let the pirates...
Have this thing...
Ugh...
I think...
Also...
Like...
Almost...
The weird...
Coral undead things...
Are at the temple...
Right?
We're trying to get into the temple...
Yeah...
They're surrounding the temple...
They know...
Leave the temple...
Hmm...
Interesting...
Interesting...
Interesting...
Almost as if...
They're setting up a perimeter...
Yup...
Yup...
Yup...
Yup...
Yup...
But...
This thing is good...
Yup...
Why...
Why is...
Mutated...
Fungus...
Among us...
That...
Wait...
Wait...
Maybe...
Maybe the pearl...
Some pirates...
That came six months ago...
About...
Around the time...
About...
Around the time...
Yup...
The...
The...
The...
The reward...
Basically became this...
Yup...
We're just reacting to...
Protect itself...
It's...
That's...
Well...
We definitely know...
Mare great isn't...
Using...
The dead, to go well...
So...
Br夫...
Pro because...
Could be...
麲d...
справ...
So...
S...
The pearl might be reacting to it...
So...
I'm pretty sure the curl...
The pearl...
So we need a punifier...
And...
Some people were first.
So, you get it back to its original purpose.
Second.
Better ideal.
Instead of beating the pirates there,
we hide,
make them think we cut and run,
and then they clear the way.
Well, no, that's stupid.
Never mind.
Strike it from the record.
We leave tonight!
Okay.
So, we cannot let the pirates have the pearl.
Correct.
We may need to restore it somehow as well.
But, yeah, we need to get it first.
I can rest it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
With that information, I do not want this pearl.
I agree.
We leave tonight.
Screw those pirates.
Well, is there any way we can slow them down?
Wait, can we collapse the cave entrance?
Well, once we get there,
we can maybe do something.
I mean, like, right here, right now,
if they're coming back in the morning on that boat,
there's nothing we can do to the beach,
to the shore,
to something that might slow them down.
I can trap it.
I got nothing.
I can trap it.
I can trap along the way, too.
It's probably the best way to go.
Well, we know the path they're taking.
Maybe we can set it up to where,
like, if we're,
for example,
if we're going right,
make them think we went left.
Since we have a map,
we got the half of the map
that leads to the entrance.
They might be more inclined to follow.
Yeah, but they,
well, we don't,
they know where we're going, right?
Because they saw the map.
They've,
they've wrote down what they remember, too.
So,
yeah.
They,
yeah.
They probably have.
Okay, yeah.
It's,
it's,
it's not so much of,
it's not so much of,
well,
let's leave that piece of the map.
Like,
you always have the whole,
we always have the whole map
to ourselves,
so you can just,
I mean,
we have a piece,
and then we wrote down
what we remembered of the rest,
but,
yeah,
so,
we don't really need that little piece.
I mean,
just like they don't need our piece.
Right.
So it's,
they're in the same situation we are.
So,
like,
they know where we're going,
we know where they're going,
so,
it's just,
we could trap the areas.
That's where I'm.
Yeah, yeah.
I like that.
Make a tramp thing.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It'll slow them down enough.
Now,
we will travel a little slower,
because I have to set them up,
but,
you're a,
you're a tinkerer, right?
We can make something happen.
Yeah.
Tate work.
Hmm.
You're,
you're also a,
a survivalist,
too,
so,
you know,
you could also do some stuff with the tracks,
as well,
if you're wanting to,
Yeah.
kind of try and divert them,
get them,
get them a little bit confused,
even though they've got,
part of the map,
they might,
be like,
oh,
they went this way,
it must be short of them.
Yeah.
Just kind of put a little bit of distance between us and them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So,
are you guys going to be,
taking off,
and going straight through the night,
and,
just skipping sleep altogether,
or,
what are your,
I mean,
for this first night,
probably,
yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
We need,
we need to get a straight ahead,
so,
we probably,
what I'm thinking is,
we basically pack up our camps,
we basically,
we make our camps,
look like we've been attacked,
or something,
soon.
Yeah,
where I'm getting at,
though,
is there are exhaustion rules,
that exist.
Yeah.
I mean,
exhaustion is bad.
You know,
for us,
what I wanted you to do,
is go in the cave,
and rest there.
I mean,
we can,
we can deal with a little bit of exhaustion.
It's going to be a couple day journey,
we'll,
we'll make up for it,
at some point.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah,
I was,
wanting to see if I have anything to say about that,
and I,
I don't.
Wait a question,
can we make our camp,
look like it's been attacked by some monsters?
I'm sure you could.
Yeah,
like,
if you wanted to.
Yeah,
like,
and we had to run,
like,
that type of thing.
So,
to make it look like,
like,
make it look like,
look like we had to run,
from monsters,
and so we,
backstabbed them.
Um,
wait,
if you want to do that,
I would need a,
I would need somebody to be making a survival goal,
and somebody to be making a performance goal.
Hmm.
Performance.
Yeah,
sounds like a survivalist,
you know.
I,
I,
it'll be down one.
All right.
Right here.
Nope,
that is persuasion perception.
Is there not a performance on me?
There's not a performance on his sheet,
but there's a performance on my sheet,
so.
What?
Did I skip performance?
Yeah,
you did,
I absolutely have a performance.
Oh,
yeah.
That's okay,
because I don't have a performance.
Yeah.
It'll just be a charisma.
Yeah.
Yeah,
plus two.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then whatever,
our survivalist survivals.
Oh.
Ryan,
I will,
uh,
want you to take a D20.
So,
this guy,
or this guy,
whichever one.
Yeah,
yeah,
don't that.
Give that a roll.
And,
oh,
that's good.
Hey,
and your survivalist looks like it's,
uh,
plus four.
Um,
with all of your skills.
There's survival.
It's like,
plus four.
Yeah,
plus four.
So that's a 21 survival.
That's pretty good.
Um,
deception.
Uh,
performance.
Her performance,
yep.
Okay.
I don't believe in performance.
That's a straight 10.
10?
Okay.
Um,
so you set up the,
uh,
you set up the camp in a way that makes it look like you guys had to move quickly.
You also,
you also have picked up a few monster parts here and there.
So you basically kind of string,
you know,
lay them around,
lay them about to kind of make it look like there's,
like there was some sort of battle.
Um,
you kind of take some,
uh,
take some fake blood and some,
you know,
different,
uh,
different things to kind of,
um,
kind of drive the point home that there was some sort of battle.
You kind of dance around a little bit as if you were fencing.
Yeah.
Um,
kind of like,
you know,
princess bride.
Yeah.
They're going to set up the foot,
trying to set up the footprints.
Yeah.
And then,
uh,
guys book it.
Yeah.
All right.
Yeah.
While we were still in view of the ship,
um,
try to be a little stealthy.
Okay.
So they don't can't,
you know,
spy us from the ship.
Right.
Once it's dark.
Yeah.
That's going to be almost a problem.
But yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That's fair.
Um,
for the record for everybody,
I need only half as much sleep as normal.
Due to being
divine or whatever.
No,
I'm just saying that
we can still get some rest,
maybe.
Uh,
for the record,
I need twice as much sleep because I'm older than everyone.
I mean,
that's
not how that works,
but
also technically I think I'm older.
I was definitely bored before you.
That doesn't matter.
It's about experience.
But both,
uh,
you know,
both the elf,
uh,
elves also have,
uh,
four hour meditation.
So they'll probably about,
about that either.
So,
yeah.
Well,
I'm small enough to fit in a backpack.
Somebody can carry me.
I don't care.
I don't care.
Nope.
That's not how resting works.
I was looking.
D&D restoration can get rid of exhaustion.
Ah,
it's not here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's fine.
Exhaustion will be bad,
but we can deal with it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right.
Okay.
So you guys travel through the night.
Um,
so let's go ahead and,
hang on.
This is the first time you've actually traveled in the night.
Nope.
How could it possibly happen?
I wouldn't worry about it.
It would be great.
All right.
Take that one.
I have,
now I have second thoughts.
It's not going to be.
I have second thoughts.
I only have first thoughts.
First thought,
best thought.
Only thought.
Okay.
Just means we're going to get more XP.
We'll just be higher level when the pirates catch up to us.
All right.
Right.
Okay.
All right.
Uh,
so let's have a little,
so you guys,
uh,
travel into the ward.
The ward is a lot more active at night than it is during the day.
Um,
you see a number of different things.
Um,
who among us has the dark visions?
I really like.
Uh,
dark vision.
I think I have some.
I think I have dark ages.
I definitely do.
Yeah,
do you have dark vision?
Same.
I don't know.
Or low light vision.
I'm not flying.
Super dark.
Yeah.
I,
I know you're a lion.
Um,
so that's not a typical,
that's not a typical species that I'm familiar with.
So,
um,
I'd be on the back.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Some lions hunt at night.
So that's.
Yeah.
I got low light vision.
Okay.
Low light vision.
Isn't dark vision.
It's,
but it is.
Helpful.
Low light.
Yeah.
No,
no dark vision.
Hmm.
No.
So.
You have a dark,
you have a dark cloak.
Into dark clothes.
All right.
I also have the dark vision,
so.
Okay.
Oh.
Uh,
dark 60.
Yeah.
So.
Okay.
I'm going to 60 and have a basket of dark 30.
Oh,
jeez.
That's real good.
Yeah.
I can't.
Is darkness on my wrist?
It is not.
That is,
that is sad.
That is very sad.
I can't.
Nope.
Let's go real quick.
Watch out.
My other.
Oh,
also.
Uh.
Just to remind everybody.
My standard operating procedure is to keep a light on everyone at all times.
I do not do that while we are getting away from the ship.
I've removed the light.
Or rather,
I will leave it on some pieces of whatever we leave at the camp so it looks like the area
on the left.
That's,
that's,
hold on.
Just a piece.
Four.
I'll come back.
Hang on,
hang on.
Four.
That.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Yes.
I can get it on my dicey.
Okay,
so.
I think what,
what you guys.
Well,
then once we're away from line to sight of the ship.
Yeah,
sure.
I will put the light back up on all of us.
was the,
the end of that thought.
Oh.
So you guys are traveling,
um,
over in,
in the night.
And something that you notice specifically is the,
the mist,
which has always been kind of a little bit wonky,
but,
um,
and I think that,
I think that mist roll on the first night,
um,
you were,
you were given watch or somebody was given watch.
Yeah,
I was given watch.
I was given watch.
Um,
well,
I don't know that you were the person that was watching when,
when this happened.
I think it was mistral.
It could have been somebody else.
I think it was mistral though.
You saw the,
the,
the fog itself kind of like move in on a,
on one of the monsters and then disappear.
Yeah.
And then there was nothing left of the monster.
Yeah.
Oh,
yeah.
Remember that?
Neither.
Well,
we're about to fight the fog.
We're about to fight the fog.
Killer mist.
You guys are kind of moving through a garden area.
Oh,
that's what I'm just looking at.
Oh my goodness.
That's all.
All right.
Um,
and you guys are over here.
Let me get you.
You're,
oh,
yeah,
we actually have a little,
uh,
little mini's fog fights.
Uh,
I mean,
not springing them down.
I apparently did not spring them down.
You are,
you are pairing us to fight pirates.
You cannot figure,
you can figure,
you can figure,
you can figure,
you can figure pieces down.
What's the verdict?
Which chips were better?
First chips you had,
or the second?
Uh,
I,
so,
I,
I'm a big fan of salt.
And the first chips were saltier.
So,
yeah.
So,
the first chips are,
just,
uh,
they're just three ingredients.
Potatoes,
salt,
and,
uh,
avocado oil.
The second chips are just three ingredients.
Chips,
salt,
but,
uh,
olive oil instead of avocado.
Ah,
great.
So,
but everybody's,
so far,
it's unanimous that the Siete Sea Salt Avocado Chips
are the ones.
That's the way to go.
Way to go versus the Trader Joe's.
All right.
So,
you guys can rearrange yourselves any way you want to,
but you're kind of traveling through this garden area,
um,
when you notice some things.
Uh-huh.
Right.
Our missing companion is the guy that's the Berserker guy.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I gotta stay in the back.
Um,
you,
and you're traveling,
like,
there,
there is,
there's mist here,
but there's always mist everywhere.
It's a little bit thicker,
um,
than what you generally have seen,
um,
but not outside of the,
uh,
not outside of the norm.
So,
you guys get going here,
get,
um,
you get through this tile.
So,
kind of traveling,
um,
go around,
get to about here.
Whatever,
whatever that was like.
and then the fog
just suddenly moves around you.
Attack fog.
It's a fog clock.
And you see,
not a whole lot,
but,
there are patches of the fog
that are thicker
than others.
Oh,
um,
thick fog.
and when the fog
moves in on you,
it's almost like
there's,
um,
where,
where you've noticed
things were
really cold.
Um,
and it,
it's cold and clammy
and,
you know,
that kind of stuff,
just kind of
more of a,
more of a ghostly
sort of situation.
All of a sudden,
the air around you
start,
you know,
just become super heated.
Um,
it's not quite to the point
where you're getting,
um,
where you're taking,
um,
damage,
but,
you're very,
um,
you all of a sudden
get really hot,
like the temperature
rises 20 degrees.
It's like a little
solid.
It's kind of nice.
And when,
and when that happens,
there,
all of a sudden,
the,
the,
the,
the fog turns
into a steam
and the steam
solidifies
into,
um,
a,
um,
into a
anthropomorphic
creature,
I guess,
anthropomorphic
steam.
Um,
and you see,
oh,
come on,
this giant
steam,
this giant,
um,
misty monster
that,
where,
like,
waves of heat
are just
raising up above it.
And,
and off to the,
and behind it
and to the side,
you see smaller
pieces,
smaller,
smaller pieces
of the,
the fog
kind of
solidify
and they almost
look like,
um,
imps,
um,
that are flying
about.
Um,
and they are,
and they're also
kind of making
a beeline
towards you.
and that is
where I'm going
to call
initiative.
Yeah,
out,
out,
out,
out,
out,
out.
Okay,
that's what,
yeah.
so for those
of you who
don't remember
initiative,
what you are,
what you're doing
is you're rolling
a d20
and then in the,
on the bottom,
on the front page
of your character
sheet,
at the bottom,
in the combat
section,
there's an
initiative number
and you add
that to your d20.
Yeah.
One and one?
Yeah!
Yeah!
Dice Jail!
Uh,
work 17 for me.
Shame!
I got,
uh,
yep,
26.
Mr.
Old got
26.
And his new
dice are working
out well.
I don't know.
Yeah,
I like one.
Lil Jon
got
17.
Oh,
it's a cool
piece of
stuff,
or it's like
the dual screen.
Yeah.
17.
Arthur,
what'd you get?
I,
I got a,
no,
no,
uh,
I,
I got a
14.
14.
Okay,
now.
Uh,
what we got,
Jesric?
19.
Oh,
that was
everybody.
That's me.
And,
aha.
Did we get a
Amber Alert?
Oh.
Yes.
Yep.
That would be,
I blame Dave.
And,
three.
I'm looking for a go.
I'm going to,
head on backwards,
do that.
Car,
shirt.
Mud,
mud color.
You could make
it a four.
Ah,
yes,
yes.
Can I get
luck for
failing initiative?
I'm pretty sure
I failed initiative.
Roll vendor,
fine,
here you go.
With advantage.
With advantage.
That's great.
All right.
With advantage.
All right,
so we,
so we are at the top
of the round.
The,
the,
the steam,
the steam creatures
are moving at you
at ludicrous speed.
Miseral,
however,
is
more ludicrous.
So,
that's true.
You,
have,
the first,
uh,
the first round of combat,
sir.
All right.
Uh,
what am I supposed to do
with all this water?
I don't think I'm like,
right?
My opinion,
you use a brain strap.
Or you know,
you can actually hit these guys.
Because they look,
don't look fully solid.
They don't look fully solid,
so.
Ah,
little John,
just remember,
I made your weapon,
uh,
magical,
so add an additional one.
The big one in the middle,
is that considered,
that's the,
the first guy that,
John,
yeah,
that's the,
that's the big monstrous,
like,
elemental.
These are all elementals.
This is what,
what you're dealing with here.
Yep.
If that matters.
More magical,
when a mental error
pierce through the,
thaw guy,
how,
uh,
movie?
I know,
normally if you pass somebody,
like,
they can react,
right?
If you leave a threatened square.
Yeah.
So you can go,
like,
like,
you could go all the way out here and around and probably be fine.
Assuming these things don't have reach,
this guy might,
but,
yeah,
so.
I'm trying to figure out like how hard do I have to be away from him in order to,
like,
if I wanted to,
so this guy.
So in general,
kind of what you're looking at here is everybody has a reach of one or five feet.
So it's any square that is around them.
Okay.
If you move out of that,
you're going to provoke an attack of opportunity.
However,
if you get yourself over here,
then you're not going to be,
um,
then you're going to be in this,
then you're going to be out of his reach and you'll be able to move freely with that.
Okay.
And it's the same thing with these guys,
unless they've got a reach,
like a 10 foot reach,
in which case it would be two squares out.
So,
but you,
you're not going to really going to know if it has a 10 foot reach until you try to go around it.
Okay.
So I'm going to come this way to your left and try and avoid his reach,
but come up to this first smaller guy.
Okay.
Um,
how much movement you got?
Uh,
40,
40,
five,
10.
I would say,
however that looks in,
I don't care where I,
you.
Yeah.
So we'll just go like five,
10,
15,
20,
25,
30,
35.
Yep.
That's fine.
And really go out and avoid it.
All right.
And,
uh,
yeah,
it's yeah.
Um,
you avoid it.
All right.
You run up to one of the little guys.
Uh,
what do you think I'm doing up front?
It's where all the action is.
what do I even play like a killer instinct bonus?
Is that just a type of B-A?
Uh,
your killer instinct bonus,
I think is just something that's granted to you.
This says enemies vulnerabilities.
Um,
here,
I'll need to take a look at the book.
Yeah.
I need to look at the book that in front of me.
Good call.
So I've got,
I've got a couple of things.
Very ranger.
Yes.
Okay.
So I'm a magic.
I got magical arrows.
Yep.
I also have scurry.
So I can move 10 feet without provoking.
Oh,
that's dope.
Opportunity attacks.
and we can look up this,
uh,
okay.
I should be able to identify what these guys weaknesses are.
Yeah.
Since they seem to be fog like.
So can,
can my arrow actually shoot them?
Oh,
and
it's magic arrow.
So
I think it's better than a horrible arrow.
Mm-hmm.
Wait.
Okay.
Okay.
So I don't have this written down.
What are these?
So if I was to use a cantor spell,
what is that kind of,
is that a,
it's an action.
That's an action.
More often than one.
So I wouldn't be able to then attack after that,
right?
Right.
Okay.
Okay.
So you've got one action,
you've got one bonus action,
and your move that you've already used.
So.
Okay.
Um,
all right,
well,
uh,
I'm going to use my hand wraps
and just start swinging on this thing.
All right.
See,
we might as well figure out what they're capable of.
Okay.
Uh,
what,
what type of,
um,
uh,
what type of damage do your hand wraps do?
Okay.
Well,
let's,
let's,
let's hold off on that.
You make the attack first.
There's your killer instinct right there on the left,
right side,
sorry,
by your thumb.
Speaking about 64 games.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Dude.
The first thing I said,
you said killer instinct.
I'm,
I have pictures of a toolkit.
Yeah.
For the attack,
I'm doing a d20,
right?
Yep.
Yep.
Yep.
I'll go to the rest of my games.
I'm doing a d20.
11.
Add your decks plus proficiency.
Well,
just add your,
um,
or add what you've got in your,
uh,
in your hand wraps.
Yep.
Probably that.
Uh,
it's in the combat section down there.
It should be like your unarmed attack.
Oh,
six.
So 17.
Um,
before it'll be seven.
Cause I think they're plus one,
right?
Right.
So,
Oh,
yep.
Yeah.
So you've got your proficient.
It might,
it might actually be six.
Cause your proficiency bonus is to.
Oh,
yes.
Oh,
yeah.
I already.
Okay.
Yeah.
So he doesn't have a plus four.
We're assuming he's got a plus four.
Um,
so 17,
17,
17 will hit that,
hit that creature.
So you give him a solid hit.
Yeah.
Um,
waiting.
That's a wrong.
Deep four.
Shit.
Yeah.
What's your being?
One,
five.
It's a deep six.
Yep.
What's the,
uh,
damage value?
What you're swinging with?
Uh,
what,
what additional,
uh,
your hand wraps do additional damage.
Do you remember what word?
Oh,
plus one D six,
which I think I,
I already have.
Yeah.
It'll be like plus one D six.
Oh,
under.
Thunder.
Yep.
There you go.
So,
I'm going to need to,
uh,
I've got to hold off.
Derek,
this is going to be the same as D and D.
So hopefully you remember,
um,
vulnerable vulnerability.
Yeah.
So it's,
if it's vulnerable to a damage,
it takes that,
damage times two.
Okay.
It's the opposite of resistance.
Okay.
Three,
five.
Okay.
And which one of those is the thunder?
Four.
The two,
the D six.
The D six is the thunder.
Okay.
Oh,
yes.
Okay.
So you've got five plus one,
whatever you've got on it.
Four.
Okay.
So that's nine.
Um,
you do 11 points of damage to that.
Three twice.
It is more effective than you would think.
Yes.
You,
you basically,
you hit it with your hand wraps and your hand wraps kind of like reverberate with sound
at,
as you hit it.
And the,
um,
the creature just kind of starts dissipating with the,
uh,
with the thunderous sound.
And then it brings itself back together,
but it appears that you did more damage than you thought you were going to do.
All right.
So what are we,
I'm fairly certain I would be doing glass.
Uh,
chances are you're probably,
you're probably correct.
And it is your turn.
All right.
Uh,
so there's a big golf monster in front of me.
There is only one thing to do when there is a big golf monster.
And that is take out your crossbow.
I'll look at straight in the dang face and try to hit it.
Yup.
So I'm going to shoot my crossbow at it.
Okay.
Uh,
that's probably going to be a miss because that is going to be,
uh,
a 13.
It's against the big guy.
A 13.
If a 14 gets me there,
I'm going to look.
Uh,
if a 14 will get you there,
a 13 will not.
I will use this year.
Luck.
All right.
Uh,
you do not need to roll your fire damage.
It is the fun.
Well,
that's,
that's less than good.
That's fine.
That is going to be a fire damage.
No,
I mean,
I mean,
it would be better.
Oh,
hang on.
Nope.
I rolled the wrong one.
What are you fired?
Is this?
So that's good to know.
This does weird.
Yeah.
Weird crossbow damage.
It's not,
it is not the eight.
It was the six.
All right.
So I'm going to do a three plus four plus three plus five.
So eight points of piercing damage to it.
Magical piercing damage.
Okay.
At that.
Eight points.
Okay,
cool.
Uh,
yeah.
So unlike,
unlike our,
uh,
resident monk,
you fire and then it hits the,
uh,
it hits the,
the invisible stalker and the flame on your arrow that you're used to exploding.
And it snuffs,
just kind of snuffs out.
And master.
Oh,
I'll shoot it.
I'll see that.
It gets snuffed down.
I'll be like,
no,
that's cheating.
You can't do that.
Is there any way to change the order in which we play?
Um,
like for,
you can like hold your action.
Yeah.
I meant like,
get me to go first.
I got this.
I can go figure out what this guy's stats are.
Oh,
the,
the,
the,
I mean,
whether or not that happens,
you know,
on your turn or it'll still be very useful.
Yeah.
In,
so in some games,
yes,
that is absolutely possible.
This game just doesn't do that.
Yeah.
So it's,
it's,
but there are other games that we might be playing in the near or distant future that do have the ability to do that.
So,
um,
for,
for instance,
if you were playing,
no,
the stormlight,
the cosmic RPG,
you can just choose to go first.
Yeah.
Um,
or if you're playing nimble,
the person who's ready first goes first.
There you go.
So it's like,
if you got something that you're itching to do,
you will go.
Uh-huh.
Um,
all right.
So we've got a flying method is going to go.
Yeah.
It's going to go right there.
And it's going to decide that it wants to,
uh,
attack a lion.
It's like,
hello,
my friend.
Hmm.
Say hello to my little friend.
Um,
the,
oh,
so sad.
It doesn't have multi-attack.
Most of the monsters in this game have multi-attack.
Um,
these are just little guys.
Yeah.
They're just little guys.
Uh,
so he's going to claw you.
Wait.
Oh,
no,
he's not going to do that.
He's going to do a,
um,
he's going to breathe in.
Oh dear.
And then exhale in a 15 foot cone.
That's pretty bad.
To cover you three.
For what?
I'm going to need some deck saves from you.
Did you say it was?
Unfortunately,
no.
You are in the clear.
You are out of the range of the,
um,
Ryan,
you're out of the range of the breath.
Weapon.
But,
eight.
But if it fails,
I have a reaction.
Also eight.
All right.
Your DC is 11.
All right.
Oh,
wait,
wait.
And it's,
it is not a deck save.
It's a con save.
I'm sorry.
Oh,
that's going to be more.
Is that better?
It's better,
but it's not,
it's 10 for me.
But still,
I'm going to still use the reaction.
Doesn't matter either way.
Doesn't matter either way for me.
Okay.
Um,
12.
12.
Okay.
So you succeeded.
Once per day,
when I fail a save,
I can gain a lock point and re-roll.
I'll do that.
Oh.
Have a lock point.
Not re-roll.
Yeah.
I succeed.
Okay.
And Ramsey.
Yep.
Have a look.
Yep.
Yep.
Yep.
Because I am small.
Okay.
Small.
Um,
everybody who failed.
Yep.
Takes five fire damage.
Okay.
And suffers one level of exhaustion.
Oh,
geez.
Exhaustion.
That's really bad.
On success,
you take half that,
so it'd be two.
Yeah.
Um,
and you have zero exhaust,
or you don't gain any exhaustion.
I heal exhaustion.
Perfect.
Um,
for those of you,
for those of you who are concerned about getting more exhaustion,
you can only get one level of exhaustion from this.
Okay.
So even if you get breathed on again,
you don't get more exhaustion.
Good.
Good.
Good.
So.
Okay.
All right.
That would,
yeah,
this would be,
yeah,
real,
real,
real bad.
These things would be very deadly.
Yes.
Um,
okay.
So explain to me what,
what,
what happened with his character.
So he got,
what did you say out there?
He,
he took some damage and got some exhaustion.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So.
Got it.
And this exhaustion thing is doing what now?
Um,
at,
at the first level of exhaustion,
I don't think really anything.
Uh,
abilities.
Yep.
It is level one of exhaustion,
disadvantage on ability checks.
You're right.
So he's got,
since he has one level of exhaustion,
he has to roll with disadvantage on pretty much everything at this point.
Not attack rolls or to daves,
but ability,
if it's like,
if you're like roll history,
you're just,
if he gets a thing.
Exhaustion,
his speed is halved.
If he gets a third,
he assists it out on packs and saves.
Because we're trying to go fast.
Point maximum level is,
is halved.
So it just kind of builds on itself until you die.
You die.
Uh-huh.
And hate,
so fire or die.
Yep.
Cool.
Cool.
Cool.
Cool.
All right.
So that one,
that one went,
uh,
the next one is going to,
um,
this one is going to move up.
Actually,
he's not going to move up.
He's going to stay where he's at.
He's going to target neutral with a steam blast.
So he's going to attack.
Steam vents?
You got to hurt yourself to do steam vents.
I don't know.
Take it,
take one day.
That is a 22 to hit,
from which,
I would be very surprised if you had an AC of 20,
50,
do,
uh,
it's 16.
It's 16.
Okay.
Uh,
so he hits,
and he does,
I can cheat.
Um,
he does four points of bludgeoning damage,
plus two points of fire damage.
So six points of damage total.
He's immune to,
he's immune to fire.
I figured.
Why didn't I take that into account with my plans?
He says,
six total?
Yeah,
six total.
All right,
next up is Lil Jon.
All right,
so I want to do,
I'm not quite sure how to do all this,
but basically I want him to use my killer instinct,
so I can figure out what the problem is with this guy.
I also want to utilize my ability,
I think it's called scurry,
scurry,
which I can move around,
without being the opportunity attack thing you're talking about.
Okay,
so then the next question is,
basically I can move five,
so I'm sort of moving,
and my range on these things are,
it's five,
right?
Yeah,
so the first thing you wanted to do is a bonus action,
which you can just use and do the bonus action,
get the information that's there.
All right.
And what's the ability to read as,
do you have to do a check or anything on that,
or do you just get information?
I believe he just gets information.
Unless it's concealed by a non-attentment spell.
That's a good idea of you that you can see,
you immediately learn the creature's immunities,
resistances,
and vulnerabilities.
Okay.
We're good.
So,
the big guy?
The big guy.
All right.
The first thing you learn is that these,
is that that creature is vulnerable to cold and thunder.
It is immune to fire,
poison,
being poisoned,
and being prone.
Being what?
Prone.
So,
it can't be knocked over.
Okay.
Um,
let's see,
what else was this?
I think so.
My arrow wouldn't do anything.
Your,
your arrow would,
it's,
it's solid.
So,
your arrow would definitely hit it.
Okay,
so he's not trying to hit it.
He just has,
yeah,
he just can't be rammed over like,
like a brano hitting it.
Yeah.
Yeah,
you can't just,
he's got no feet.
Knock him over.
He can't be knocked off.
He's kind of flying.
Okay.
Around.
So,
that's,
that's,
that's kind of the thing.
So,
all right.
Now we know that my arrows will in fact hit this guy.
Yes.
And then my other ability,
I can move around without him killing me.
Yeah.
So,
and yeah,
if you've got,
if you've got cold or thunder,
then you're going to be doing extra damage.
If you've got fire,
then you're going to be doing no damage with the fire.
Um,
but an arrow is not either one of those.
Right?
Yeah.
Nope.
You're good.
So you,
you actually don't have to worry about it at all.
Cause you don't have any elemental add-ons to your,
to your weapon.
Uh,
like some of the other.
This is 150.
Oh yeah.
You can hit it from very far.
You can shoot.
Yeah.
So I'm,
as far as you can see,
I should say.
Right.
So I want to get the help.
I want to stay away from this guy.
Yes.
Yep.
And then you can go off in a corner.
And then,
take a shot in.
Do I want to go to the big guy or the little guy?
You guys can hit the little guy.
I'm going to shoot the big guy.
All right.
All right.
Warning,
and I've got my braces of archery,
which add damage.
And I've got the,
I don't know what to call this thing,
the pinning shot.
Right.
So the pinning shot will,
if you use pinning shot,
that will,
in lieu of damage,
do,
do something else.
So if you want to do damage to him,
you don't want to do the pinning shot.
You just want to shoot it.
Oh,
okay.
So,
the pinning shot is something like you,
you nail it to a wall,
or you nail it to a ground,
so it can't move around.
Okay.
Which is useful in some situations.
This one's just fine.
Okay.
I mean,
I got the,
I imagine the pink magic too,
so Aaron Hux one there as well.
I don't know if we've added,
and you do remember,
I think we did the,
so right now you've got the,
you've got the 1d8 for the,
for the longbow,
then you've got your plus six to damage,
which is appropriate,
because you've got a plus three for your deck,
so that's including his plus one that he's given you.
You also get a d4 to damage,
just because you're a hunter,
you're a hunter ranger,
so you just add a d4 to your damage.
If you want to,
you can also mystic mark this guy.
Yes,
that would have an additional d4 to your damage,
if you hit it.
So,
but wait,
yeah,
you did hit him,
or you haven't shot yet.
He hasn't shot.
So if you shoot,
then you can decide whether or not you want to use your mystic mark,
because you've only got two mystic marks.
Is this the right,
the 20s?
Yep.
Seven.
Seven plus your,
uh,
to hit,
which is on the front,
front page,
on your longbow,
it's your bonus there.
So,
seven plus six is 13.
It's just under.
13.
Uh,
he,
his ace is 14,
but a left point will get you there.
Oh,
I am.
All right.
So you hit him.
Blue,
we go.
So,
now,
you pull up a d8.
Um,
so,
like,
one of that,
that guy.
Okay.
And then a d4,
that you,
you get that automatically.
D4 is the pyramid.
Four,
where's the pyramid?
And if you want to,
and if you want to mark him
with your mystic mark,
you can grab another d4
and add that in there too.
Okay.
That's one of these.
Yeah.
So,
roll his three.
Roll those three.
Get him.
Meow.
Oh,
no.
Not a one.
Well,
it looks like he did it.
Oh,
that's another one.
So,
you got two ones in the three.
That's what I see.
Nope.
I don't know what this one is.
That looks like a one.
That's a one.
Yeah.
One,
one,
and that one is at the top instead.
This is the three.
Yeah.
So,
you do five points damage plus,
you were plus six damage.
So,
even though you rolled terrible,
you still did 11 points of damage to the thing.
Okay.
Which,
for the record,
is still insane.
So,
it should be a pretty good move against him.
I mean,
he's,
yeah,
he's sort of a floating thing,
but he can still,
turns out,
not transparent.
He can still shoot him with a arrow.
19.
All right.
Right.
And I know that number.
I know that he's only got so many remaining,
right?
She,
oh,
you know his hit points as well?
Wouldn't I,
wouldn't,
didn't that come out of the,
scene behind you there?
It's possible.
I don't believe so,
but,
from what I,
immunities,
resistances,
and vulnerabilities,
or,
learn a third,
that has none.
Okay,
so no,
I don't know what's actual health,
but I do know that he,
what I can hit him with.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
I,
yeah,
but I can,
I can,
still good.
Yeah.
Um,
good,
I,
that's it.
So,
questions,
because,
what I still do bonus damage with,
if I do channel the,
the,
the,
radiant?
Yeah,
can I still do radiant damage?
Yep.
Yep.
With,
with the,
it's normal.
We'll just do normal damage?
Yeah.
Okay.
I don't,
I mean,
extra damage,
but we'll do normal damage.
Correct.
Right.
Right.
And,
question,
right in bold.
Yeah.
And,
was that,
that's a good one?
Yep,
but it's also radiant.
Right,
okay,
that's also radiant.
Yep,
yep,
yep.
Thus,
thus making sure of it,
what's not thunder.
Uh-huh.
I wish.
my little,
thunder,
anchor,
swinging,
cobalt would've come in handy here.
Yes,
he would've.
It would've been nice,
yeah.
That's all right.
Um,
the,
just,
so people are aware,
the steam mythot that,
mistral hit,
is,
injured.
Yep.
Um,
which is,
yeah,
uh,
which,
which is more than,
um,
which is more than,
uh,
barely injured,
which is what the big steam monster is.
Got it.
So,
mistral hit that guy,
knocked him down to,
knocked him down pretty,
pretty quickly.
Yep.
The big steam monster has been hit by two guys with medium hits and he's barely injured.
Yep.
So,
take that and mocked.
Okay.
Be big.
Yep.
Big boy.
Um,
high big.
All right.
So now we've got,
uh,
the,
big boy.
We've got,
uh,
D,
the green D.
He's going to come,
come up here.
Um,
he's going to,
he's going to come up here and he's going to shoot a steam,
attack at the little gnome.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh,
so he's going to blap.
You're going to get a blast of steam in your face.
I'm certainly going to try with the nap 20.
He does.
Mm hmm.
Um,
he does,
he does.
Um,
well,
steam blast.
Uh,
steam blast is one.
Do it somewhere.
Maybe.
With your light shield.
And he does six points of damage to you.
Steam blast.
All righty.
Moving on to Arthur.
Yes.
Okay.
Where's the.
Excuse me.
Oh,
okay.
Let's see what I can do.
Oh,
okay.
And for,
for,
um,
and Ian,
just keep,
keep going up.
But I do want to make sure that,
um,
from,
from a strategic perspective,
just to give the newer players a little bit of an idea.
When you,
uh,
the,
the best thing to do in these sorts of situations,
when you've got a bunch of bad guys that you're facing,
there are more of them than there are of you,
is to remove,
remove opponents as quickly as possible.
So if there are bad guys that you're able to drop quickly,
then those are the ones that you want to focus on,
because there'll be fewer attacks that are coming your way.
So,
um,
try to hit the little guy,
but.
So,
so,
yeah.
So focusing fire on the little guys and dropping them as quickly as
possible will make your life easier and less likely that you're
going to.
Oh,
okay.
Get,
get hurt.
So just,
you know,
it,
I know it doesn't really make sense a lot of the time when you're
playing a game.
It's like,
you know,
you got to spread out.
Damage and that kind of stuff.
But this is really a focus on fire,
silver situation.
My,
when I play video games,
I basically,
I attack the big guy and what,
um,
I attack the big guy first always in video games.
And I take out the little guys after.
Yeah.
I don't know.
He just had that,
whatever you call that fire breath thing and took out,
hit three people at the same time.
Oh,
that was the little guy.
Big guy hasn't done that yet.
Yeah.
Big guy hasn't done anything yet.
Yeah.
Uh,
also,
also,
maybe,
go to the other side of this thing at least so that he doesn't hit all
of us with the big old breath.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'll play.
I can't wait.
So,
yeah.
So,
so,
yeah.
so in this game,
also templates are a thing.
So spreading out like what you did,
where you moved as far away as possible,
that's a really good tactical.
So that you're not plumped together.
So that it's easy to drop like these templates on you.
So,
okay.
my,
my idea was to,
to aggro the big guy on me.
Mystic could go up to it and start smacking it.
You totally can do that.
Um,
it,
like,
I mean,
really,
it's kind of like whatever you guys want to do.
Yep.
Strategic wise.
Like if you want somebody to try and keep the attention of the big guy and then have
everybody else worry about the ads.
Yes.
That's what I'm,
that's what,
that's,
that's what I want to do.
As,
as far as little John is concerned though,
he's already mystic marked the big guy.
So he,
his best move 100% of the time at this point is going to be to attack the big guy.
Cause you can't move your mystic mark really hard.
So if you want to be doing all that extra damage,
you have to be attacking.
Oh,
it'll be worth it.
Double proficiency bonus.
That's real good.
Yep.
Basically an extra plus two.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Okay.
Then I'm,
will I get a tackle opportunity if I moved to take that,
the little guy behind the big guy?
If you moved here?
No.
If you moved to this guy?
Yes.
You would definitely take him and tackle opportunity from that guy.
Okay.
So.
Like at this point,
if you want to move you,
you have the option of moving around this guy,
but you can't move out away from it.
Okay.
I'll,
I'll,
I'll,
I'll go behind him to get,
to get to.
Okay.
So you're going like here.
Navigate there.
Yes.
Yeah.
Good spot.
And that will not provoke because you're still within his reach.
Yes.
It's only when you leave his reach.
Okay.
So,
and I'm,
thanks sir.
I'm going to use,
hmm.
I'm going to channel divinity.
Okay.
And I'm going to use my hammer and smash this guy.
Okay.
That's a little bit.
So what's your channel divinity do?
Okay.
You can channel your divine power and use a divine,
a bit,
divine ability.
What?
Okay.
All right.
That channel divinity.
You channel your deity's power and use a channel divinity ability.
Yes.
All right.
What's the next one?
You have,
you have channel divinity.
Oh,
divine things.
Here.
Let me see real quick.
Yeah.
Sorry.
That is a channel divinity.
It looks like it is just that or this.
So,
you can either sanctifying light.
So this would blind aberration fiend or undead,
which that's not that,
or you can sacred weapon weapon sheds light.
You add your charisma to attack rolls.
Yeah,
I would do.
Okay.
That will cost you your action.
So you won't be able to attack when you do that,
but you'll be all powered up,
but you will be powered up for your next attack.
Right.
Okay.
Yeah,
I would do that.
Okay.
So you,
so you're my hammer,
your hammer all of a sudden starts glowing with this mystic energy and the
mist itself kind of,
kind of dissipates around it as you power yourself up for a divine attack.
Yes.
Okay.
Cool.
Cool.
I don't know why that was good.
It's,
it fits.
All right.
So you are,
you are set up for next turn.
Okay.
A bonus action shield raising.
I don't know if that's a thing in this game,
but I think Dino Divinity was a bonus action.
No,
Dino Divinity was an action.
Was an action.
Like your sacred weapon was your action.
So you have a bonus action.
Oh yes.
Yes.
Then guard.
Definitely.
Okay.
And you raise your shield.
So you are,
you are exuding mystical,
magical night right now.
Yes.
Which is great because it's his turn.
Oh,
well,
um,
yes.
So he is going to,
yeah.
Yeah.
Nice.
He is going to,
um,
basically take his fists and slam down on you twice.
Okay.
All right.
Hold on a shield.
What does your guard got 20?
Yes.
I hit a 20.
Yeah.
But there's your guard do a,
um,
does it give disadvantage or does it give advantage?
Or does it raise your shield?
The attack,
one attack against your ally.
Or you,
uh,
against any ally within five feet has disadvantage.
Okay.
So yeah,
it's,
it's disadvantage against you or anybody who attacks you.
So the,
his first attack is going to be a,
uh,
17 to hit.
Nope.
That's,
uh,
his second,
so it bounces off of this,
but bounces off of your shield as you,
somebody got full plate armor.
He's got full plate armor.
Yeah.
He's got a bunch of like magic stuff,
but he's got full ball.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
and then this is a 21 to hit.
Yeah.
Well,
that will hit.
Okay.
I cast shield on him.
No,
that'd be OP.
That would be OP.
Um,
all right.
You take 13 points of bludgeoning damage plus nine points of cold damage.
Or nine points of fire damage.
I'm sorry.
Not cold damage.
Oh,
I see.
that is a grand total of two of 22 points of damage that you take.
Oh,
well,
don't,
don't get hit.
Don't get it by the big guy.
And I will need you to make a DC 15 dex save.
Okay.
Dexterity,
but it's cold.
Okay.
And that's a,
I'm out.
And a dex save.
And what?
DC.
15.
DC 15.
This guy is a big,
bad dick.
Yeah,
he is.
What you got?
Um,
uh,
blow.
Fair.
Blow.
Okay.
One.
One.
All right.
Well,
your speed is halved for the rest of the encounter.
Luck point.
He gets a luck point.
You do get a luck point.
He gets a luck point.
So,
congratulations.
He wants a beat.
He's half,
but you're bad.
He accepts your conservation price.
Oh,
right.
Right.
There you go.
Bonus.
It's all working out as planned.
And I cannot take another hit from that guy.
Yeah,
he's,
uh,
he's rough,
but you are pretty much the best guy to,
to,
uh,
to be taking that.
Cause nobody else.
Cause well,
you could take that hit.
Plus you've got the best AC out of everybody.
Yeah.
Um,
plus you can heal yourself.
Yeah,
I can heal myself.
And which I am going to be doing.
Probably.
Yeah.
Touches.
What was actually next round?
Um,
okay.
So now we have,
um,
the,
this guy.
Yeah.
I can't work.
But,
and he's gonna shoot a,
uh,
shoot a steam blast at you,
little John.
Uh,
does an 11 hit your army class or AC in the,
I hope on that.
On the bottom.
AC base 14.
All right.
So he and he misses.
So you've dodged out of the way as this spray of steam comes at you.
All right.
And now it's the,
the last,
the last one.
He's going to be,
he's right at mistral.
He's going to claw you.
Wow.
Uh,
he's going to hit you.
For.
Um,
I rolled an 18.
So.
I think he's got plus 18 on the back.
I need two to hit.
Oh,
well.
So that's going to do four points of slashing and two points of fire damage.
So six points of damage.
Tom.
Can you see the book real quick,
Tom?
Yes.
Yes.
It would be worth doing that.
Next up,
Xander.
Xander.
All right.
Xander.
How are you going to save this situation?
You've changed.
I didn't keep hitting this guy,
but this sucker is annoying,
annoying me.
A hopper.
You dodged around from him.
I mean,
it might not be,
it might not be bad for you to start attacking the little guys.
You just won't get that extra D4 when you're attacking him.
You,
if you attack the big guy,
you will get him dead.
Get him dead.
It's the only way.
There's nothing like,
nothing like the rush.
This guy's hurt.
Yeah.
And what?
So my ring is actually.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
So we're going to back up because that seems like a good thing to do.
Because I am a sick bot super squid.
But I'm a little squish.
I don't want to be anywhere near that big guy.
Oh,
my heart.
Actually,
no.
Hold on.
Hold on.
But I have a better idea.
Yes.
Yes.
I have a better idea.
Um.
Because I am not actually super squish.
I'm squish to the big guy.
But these little guys don't bother me too much.
They take 20.
We're going to move right,
right next to this guy.
Because I forgot the other half of an ability I have.
All right.
Cool.
I'm going to move right there.
And then I'm going to raise my shield.
Let's go.
We're going to call upon the light.
Let's go.
The light.
All my light sources are going to flare.
What time of day is it,
by the way,
Chris?
This is broad daylights out,
baby!
Woo-hoo!
It's night.
It's the middle of the night?
Yep.
So there's like a 0% chance that the pirates are right at the beach where I left my light sources?
There's a 0% chance that the pirates are right at the beach where you left your light sources.
I was just going to check.
All right.
Cool.
So every single thing on this battlefield,
that's not us.
Needs to make a DC-15 constitution save.
And if they are aberrations or undead,
it is at a disadvantage.
But I don't think these steps are.
They are not.
All right.
So.
Go.
2, 3, 4, 5.
Okay.
That's all right.
That's all right.
That's a bit sold.
No.
Pretty.
Yeah, very pretty funny.
Constitution save, you said?
Yep.
Unfortunately.
But yes.
Jiggle.
Let's talk.
Okay.
Actually, let me read myself a little bit because that's a very stupid place to be.
I'll go right here.
Right here.
Well, you aren't.
That's actually not that.
What's the DC again?
15.
15.
So you have one critical success and four failures.
Oh, excellent.
Critical success doesn't matter in this game, right?
I don't think so.
No.
It's just success and failure.
Yeah.
The failures take 18 radiant and the success will take 9 radiant.
Kabow!
That's how much family do just to be each one?
Correct.
We nuked him.
Yeah.
I should have breathed on more people.
Oh, and I do also need to roll for the big bad guy as well.
That was just the...
Oh, that was just the whole one.
So once...
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
Seize Bash.
Loud again.
That was so good.
That's your channel divinity?
Yeah.
That comes back on a short rest?
Yes, correct.
Short rest?
Correct.
Oh, yeah.
That's it.
It's doggie good.
This guy is dead.
Oh, sweet.
All right.
The big bad...
Big bad guy.
I don't know.
DC 15?
Yep.
Okay, he passes.
Yep.
I suspected.
So 9 for him.
Yep.
All right, cool.
So, my action.
For my bonus action.
Okay.
I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon.
Pushyard.
Then I'm going to create a...
What does my Spiritual Weapon look like?
I think I did some before.
It's probably a Trident.
Trident makes sense.
Trident serve for ruling seven seas.
And that is what Moraine does.
Which one of these little guys passed?
Which one looks at least damaged, if I know that?
They all look equally damaged.
Oh, okay.
The guy that did pass was the guy that...
Yep.
Is dead.
Was already dead.
Was already hurt.
All right.
We're going to put my Spiritual Weapon right here.
Okay.
Oof.
And it's going to attack this guy.
Okay.
With advantage of its flanking.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
It is flanking.
Oh.
No.
No.
I don't think your Spiritual Weapon can obtain flanking.
But maybe...
Oh, yeah.
He might use it as not a person.
But that is...
I mean, that's a him.
That's a him thing.
I would say no.
But that's fair.
But that's a DM.
I am unsure, to be honest.
I don't know how that works.
Yeah.
I don't know how that works.
I don't know.
Yeah.
I'll...
No, I think you're right, because it can't be targeted.
Yeah.
Right.
Yes.
So, it doesn't lead us off.
It's not threat.
Yes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right.
Cool.
I'll regret this.
Oh, bam.
Oh, that's not good.
These things are 14, right?
They...
The big one is?
The big one's 14.
The little ones are 12.
Well...
Here you go.
I have to roll so low to get a 12.
All right.
All right.
Sick.
So, this sucker is going to take...
Plus wisdom, 11 points of radiant damage to the dome.
Right.
It is going to die.
Crunch.
That's what we like to hear.
It's going to die.
In a hoof of steam.
Get these little dudes all.
Oh, yeah.
All right.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
All right.
I mean, just to be...
To be...
So that everybody is aware, at least.
Even though he...
Like, he did a lot of damage.
But...
That was against...
Itty bitty guys.
So...
Anything that can make a con save, which is most monsters...
You wouldn't have done nearly as much damage to you.
Right.
So...
Just in case anybody's feeling a little bit inadequate at the moment.
No, no, no.
Don't...
The trick is...
To not care...
What other people do...
When you're in the role-playing scenario.
Because it's like...
I could...
I could build a character that did a lot of damage.
Or...
Or...
To just celebrate the...
Why did he go?
Part of what's happened.
Why did he skip him?
Oh, no.
He goes...
He went first.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, no.
I'm not saying.
He...
Now...
No, he's...
He...
Oh, it did...
Your thing did...
But that's fine.
He is gonna go.
Mr. O'Reilly, you're up.
All right.
Oh, punch a thing with your thunder gauntlets?
Yep.
Punch them good.
Thunder...
Right here for this team.
Yeah.
Right?
Um...
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Yes.
I'm...
I'm going...
I'm not...
I'm not trying to play your character.
No, you're okay.
But...
Just...
In this game...
You can...
Move...
And if you haven't used all your movement...
You can move again...
And do another thing.
So...
You could...
Move those...
Ten feet...
To...
Blue A.
Yep.
Attack him.
Kill him.
If you kill him.
Yep.
Then move to green D.
Flurry of Blows...
Or...
Or...
Just do your martial arts as a bonus action attack.
Yep.
Attack him...
And potentially kill him.
All right.
Flurry of Blows.
So you can basically just kind of run around the battlefield.
I have to have to flurry of...
Yep.
And if you do the flurry of blows...
It does.
But if you do the flurry of blows...
And you hit this guy, kill him...
And your attack does...
Enough damage to kill him.
And you move over here.
And you attack him.
And do enough damage to kill him.
If you're...
You have a third attack with your flurry of blows.
Which means you can just move on to attack you.
Okay.
So you just like move up the line.
Okay.
Which...
Thank you.
Yeah.
Pretty baller.
Yeah.
Let's do it.
Just...
All right.
So we're doing the...
Handwrecked...
The Thunder Blow...
Thunder...
Yep.
That thing.
Those guys.
Yep.
Yep.
On the little blue way.
Which is a 17.
Oh, that's gonna hit.
So then I'm coming down here.
17 plus your bonus on there.
Which should be a 6.
So that's a 23 to hit.
His AC is a 12.
So...
Now...
D4...
D6...
Yep.
I've got a 10.
Plus 14.
That'll probably definitely do it.
So...
Okay.
So this guy has 9 hit points left.
Yeah.
You...
Because you're using Thunder...
Thunder damage with that D6...
Yep.
You did double damage.
Uh-huh.
So you did 12 points of damage just with that D6.
Oh, because that's like rolling a...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I don't remember.
So you did 12 points of damage with that.
Plus the 4 there.
Which is...
16 points of damage.
Plus whatever damage you do on top of that.
Which I think...
Plus 4.
Plus 4?
Yeah.
So...
20 points of damage?
Am I mapping correctly?
I think so.
Many damages.
How do you want to have killed this thing?
Yeah.
Uh...
It's got 9 hit points.
So you just over damage the hell of it.
Um...
Yeah.
I swing hit him and he just...
Because, uh...
With it being the Thunder...
The Thunder rep.
It's like...
He just kind of sucks my hand in and just starts vibrating and it just explodes from the
inside out.
Awesome.
All right.
So that was Buck Buck number 1.
Now you're going to move back up here, right?
Yep.
Okay.
And you spin a Technique Point and do your Flurry of Blows.
Yeah.
Excuse me.
Yeah.
4.
4 plus 6.
Which is a 10.
That's not going to hit.
No.
Um...
But you can.
Um...
12 hits, right?
12 hits.
Yeah.
Tool Lock will get you there.
12 hits, right?
Yeah.
Okay.
Hmm.
Yep.
All right.
So roll that D6 and D4 again.
And...
Okay.
So that's 6 plus 6, 7, plus 4.
11.
It's 11.
Again, this guy has 9 hit points left.
So you kill him.
And then I still have...
You still have one more attack.
And I'm assuming a similar thing.
It just kind of...
The sonic sound just forces the form to dissipate and it just evaporates into the air.
By the time your turn comes...
I know.
Right?
You don't have to worry about any of these small guys.
You just focus on the baseboard.
16.
That's going to hit.
Oh, yeah.
16 plus...
Oh, yeah.
It's...
22, which is going to hit a 12.
And it's also...
I think of that stabbing him.
Right?
Hmm?
Because he's right kind of.
Right?
He's facing me.
Yeah, but that doesn't...
It's not really facing.
I got a 9.
Yes.
But if you do move a little bit, it won't flank.
Yeah.
He does obtain the flanking.
Which is just advantage on his hit.
But he already...
But he already hit, so...
Yeah.
Okay, so...
9.
Okay.
Well, again, this guy is vulnerable to thunder.
So that at least is a 10.
So that's 10, 14, 18 points damage.
You do too.
Okay.
Ah.
That's...
That's...
That's real nice.
That's real nice.
Yeah.
All right.
Um...
Basically, he came in and does...
Swap.
Swap.
He...
Basically, he did what monks do.
They just run around the battlefield and hit everything.
That's just kind of what they do.
Um...
All right.
Uh...
So the...
Invit...
The, uh...
The big steam monster is injured at this point.
So he's taken a fair amount of damage, but he is not, um...
Yet bloodied.
And bloodied, it's, like, half the hit once.
All right.
Jesric.
Uh...
Well...
First is much like the second.
Uh-huh.
So I'm gonna hit this big guy.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right in the face.
With this exploding crossbow bolt, I will hit it with a natural 20.
Okay.
Oh, great.
Look.
I will...
Roll these 2d6s.
Oh, when you got your fire damage.
Yeah, yeah.
I will roll two ones on those d6s.
So that is gonna be two plus...
So that's gonna be seven points of damage.
And then I will do the most important thing.
Uh-huh.
I will move and start yelling at it.
Calling it the degrading names that I know elementals hate.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
You...
I'll say its...
Its mother was a light breeze, and its father...
Couldn't lift a pebble.
It will be very offended at you.
Look.
Good.
It cheats.
Nope.
Nope.
All right.
It is the Invisible Stalker's turn.
Come on.
Invisible Stalker?
Oh, sorry.
I used the wrong words.
This guy, what's he going to do this time?
Uh, he is going to...
Oh.
He's got multi-attack.
So, he's going to slam.
Let's see.
He's got choices.
Cool.
What's slammable?
Well, he's going to continue to try and attack Arthur.
Oh.
He's going to...
I don't think that's gonna work.
Nope, that's not gonna work.
Nope, that's not gonna work.
He's gonna miss Arthur's voice.
Um, and then the insulting gnome needs to be put in his place.
So, look.
I'll try.
He's gonna...
Does a...
Does a...
23 hit?
Almost.
Yeah.
Almost.
But yeah, it does hit.
Shieldable.
Yep.
It's not quite shieldable.
If I did the other thing, I was gonna think about doing it.
It would have been shieldable, but...
Okay.
I didn't.
So...
So, you take 13 points of blushing damage.
Uh-huh.
And 9 points of coal...
Uh, 9 points of fire damage.
Uh-huh.
And...
Um...
I need you to make a DC 15 dex save.
And if you fail, your speed is halved.
I did not fail.
Okay, you're good.
And then it's going to use...
It's a bonus action.
Oh, I should have done the thing.
Gosh darn it.
Okay, and it's going to focus on...
It's going to use its bonus action against Mistral.
And what it's going to do is steal your breath.
I need you to make a DC 15 con check.
So, you need to roll, um...
A d20.
And then...
Okay, and then what you're going to be doing is you're going to be looking at your con ability
score at the top and the save bubble above that and add that to your number seven.
Okay, so you do not hit a DC 15 con save.
Um, you are unable to speed cast spells with verbal components until the end of the turn.
Um, a creature that fails a save by five or more is also incapacitated in suffering.
Oh, he seems more incapacitated.
It's like he's incapacitated now.
So, what that means is an incapacitated creature can't take any actions besides reactions.
Um, so I'm going to go ahead and put a...
Well, no bueno.
Put a thing here.
So, you basically, you're trying to catch your breath.
Yep.
And you can't do anything until you, uh...
Until you're able to make that save.
Um...
Oh.
Uh, there's also a suffering.
Uh, incapacitated and suffocating for the...
Oh, suffocating.
Okay.
As it coughs uncontrollably.
Yep.
Okay.
Suffocating.
Suffocating.
When the word died, yeah.
Huh.
It doesn't specify duration here.
It just says for the duration.
So, I'm going to...
It's the same end of the turn as the...
The spells thing?
Yeah.
I would assume.
Yeah.
End of the next turn.
Yeah.
So, basically, you effectively lose a, um...
You lose a turn unless somebody's able to do something to...
Heal your incapacitation before...
Before your next turn comes in.
Okay.
So, this isn't a save to get free of.
It's just you lose your next turn and then you're back in the fight.
So, you don't have to worry about it.
And that's just for, uh, actions, right?
I can do a reaction on my turn?
You can do reactions.
And reactions you don't do during your turn.
They're...
Oh.
Stuff that you can do outside of it.
Okay.
So.
Um.
All right.
Little John.
All right.
So, I'm going to do that same, uh...
Bracer of Archery.
And...
He's already marked.
Yep.
So, that is the what, the what, the what, uh...
So, what, what way?
The base you dice?
Uh, yeah.
So, you're going to roll your d20 to hit.
So, just roll that.
And then we're adding, uh, your to hit on that, which is...
6 plus 2 because you're doubling your proficiency bonus, so it's plus 8.
So, it's an 18 to hit, which hits his D...
Hits his AC of 14, so you hit him.
Now you need to roll, uh, d8 damage plus 2d4.
So, that's...
Two of those.
Yeah.
The two pyramids and the...
And that.
That looking dude.
Get him.
Oh, that's good.
I see a 3.
I don't see...
Or a 4.
Nothing so bad.
Um, so, it looks like you've got a 2.
And then a 3.
So, that's 5.
9.
And then you add your damage.
That's plus 6.
So, that's 15 points of damage.
Okay.
That's...
Yeah.
That's a good shot.
That is a really good shot.
It's just...
It's punching like a...
Punching like a truck there.
All right.
Um, you...
So, you...
You fire your arrow.
Um, it hits the thing.
And this...
This creature at this point is bloody.
It's...
It's looking...
It's looking like it's, uh...
Not feeling so hot.
And then next up is...
Not that guy.
One of the big...
Maybe Arthur.
Okay.
Arthur.
I'm, uh...
Arthur.
Yeah.
Okay.
Got a little guy next to you and a big guy next to you.
Okay.
And a shiny hammer.
Okay.
The first thing...
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
For my burger section, I'm going to...
Um...
Going to...
I'm going to use healing hands.
Lay on hands on me.
And...
Okay.
I'm going to put...
How many points do I have for this?
Uh...
I think you have 15 total that you can use.
And you can spend as many of those as you want.
Okay.
I'm going to put 6 points on myself.
Okay.
So, you heal yourself for 6.
Yep.
It was my...
Oh.
There's that.
Oh.
Thank you.
Heal my points for 6.
Sorry.
I didn't pull out any...
Any new pencils here.
That's all right.
Yeah.
Give me up my 15.
Yeah.
And I'm also swinging...
I'm also...
I missed our button.
Also, I am swinging my...
Holy hammer down at the little guy.
All right.
Yeah.
So, go ahead and roll your to hit.
And you're...
And you're also rolling...
I believe you're adding your charisma to hit.
Yep.
I know.
My charisma to hit as well.
Yep.
Okay.
Yeah.
So, if you're not able to hit this thing with any roll, then there's a problem.
Plus, I hit this roll.
That's a good one.
Oh, that's a 15.
Oh, yeah.
That'll hit.
You easily hit that guy.
Are you...
Which one?
The big one or the little one?
He said the little one.
The little one.
Okay.
Cool.
Yeah.
All right.
So, take your damage for your...
Okay.
And with my damage for my weapon.
Okay.
Warhammer.
Plus seven.
One.
Eight.
Eight.
Okay.
Eight.
Eight.
Plus.
Yep.
One.
Eight.
Plus five.
Plus five.
Is what it looks like.
We got six.
I got...
You rolled a one?
I rolled a one.
Okay.
And...
Wait.
And do I add my...
Do I add my charisma on it?
No.
The charisma only helps on your attack with the...
Oh, God.
...sacred weapon.
Okay.
So, you do six points of damage...
...to this guy.
Unfortunately, it's not enough to finish him.
There.
But he is near death.
Yeah, okay.
Thank you.
So, he is at death's door.
Oh, my God.
But it's his turn.
So, he's going to...
What's he going to do?
What's he going to do?
What's he going to do?
What's he going to do?
He's got options.
I think he's going to claw you.
Or he's going to attempt to claw you.
Which would be hard to do.
He's going to miss his claw.
But he's going to decide to try and run away.
Which you have an attack of opportunity that you can choose to use.
Yeah, I will.
I will.
So, roll.
And as long as you're...
As long as what you get ends up being above a 14,
you will have killed this thing.
There's no way that you wouldn't have killed it.
That's going to...
That's going...
I'm using my hammer, and that's going to be another 15.
Yeah, I'll hit it.
I'll do.
So, you do minimum 4 points damage, which is enough to kill it.
So, good job.
Get out of here, Steam Mist Fog.
And...
Xander, you're up.
All right.
Well...
That's it.
We're going to move our little trident.
It's going to float on over here.
And it's going to try to stabby-stab.
Quick!
Ooh, he's trying.
He's going to fail.
I don't know about these dice, Chris.
Sorry.
I do get a lock, though.
Yes, yes.
I get a lock.
I'm trying to supply you with as much luck as possible.
More time today.
All right.
And then, we really need this thing.
This thing, I don't like it.
It hurts.
It hits like a truck.
It's not good.
So, we're going to move a little bit so that I can see it.
I didn't hear no bell.
Right?
Then, I'm going to cast a guiding bolt.
So, I'm going to raise my shield.
And from the center of the symbol, a laser beam, essentially, of radiant energy comes shooting out at it.
Um, and we will see what we do here.
Stop rolling once.
Really?
Stop it.
I'm going to toss in all three of these.
Laser beam.
Try this one instead.
Oh, that's better.
Oh, that is an 18 total.
All right.
That will hit.
Excellent.
All right.
And this does 46 radiant.
Uh, 8, 10, 11 radiant.
Okay.
And the next attack roll made against it is at advantage.
Which will be very helpful.
I hope so.
To not misceral, because misceral is currently suffocating.
Takes a breath.
However, at the end of your turn, you're able to catch your breath.
So, it's kind of like, you know, when, well, I experienced this, probably nobody else, ever, nobody else did that.
But when you're a kid, and you're jumping on the trampoline, and you land on your head, and you just can't, you can't breathe.
That's, that's what you're doing.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Just terrible.
Most traumatic experience of my young adult, of my, of my young life, not young adult life.
Um, and, Jezric, you're up.
Well, there's only one thing to do.
Yep.
That's to hit it.
That's correct.
I'm going to attempt to hit this thing again.
Okay.
Oh.
You rolled a 20.
I also rolled a 1.
Well, it's a good thing that you had advantage.
Now, try not to blow Snake Eyes.
Yeah.
It's not Snake Eyes.
Better.
Uh, that is going to be, uh, 12.
12 points of piercing damage.
Not bad.
That is pretty solid.
That is solid.
Alright.
Um.
I can close the ladder.
So, as you guys start piling on this damage, like, the, the steam itself starts, starts cooling this, this creature.
While it is still solid, just kind of starts losing its shape.
Um, it is near death.
Excellent.
So, keep, keep, keep doing your thing.
But it's, it's turn.
Um, and it is going to, it's going to do a slam on, uh, it's going to do a slam on Arthur.
Uh, it's going to get one of these, but, uh, and it's going to hit Arthur.
I'm going to die.
You're taking, you're taking, uh, 22 points of damage.
Yep.
Yeah, it's like a lot of damage.
Not dead.
Nope.
Unconscious.
It is false.
There is a very important distinction.
You are, you dropped unconscious.
Yep.
Um, so, we will go ahead and, um, mark that accordingly.
So, Arthur is unconscious.
Yeah.
Um, which means you are not dead.
Okay.
But you need healing.
Um.
You are dying.
Silver lion needs healing badly.
That's what's going on.
And it is going to also slam Mistral because that's caught.
All right.
Um, seven plus seven, 14, 14.
Yes.
I hear no stinking.
Good job.
You, uh, you bouncing around here.
And then it's going to, uh, and then I'm going to ask for a con save for Grums Inn.
Erzander.
It's going to attempt.
It's caught on.
It's going to try and suck the life out of you.
And he don't like it.
He don't like it.
Negative.
You got three luck points.
Oh, wait.
No.
Not anymore.
Well, you're about to get one.
I got one.
You got one.
Here you go.
All right.
Well, I don't want to get five or more, so I'm fascinated.
Wait, did I get a luck point?
Uh, for fate, for dropping dead?
No.
Or for dropping unconscious?
No.
He technically did fail his dexterity saving throw because he was unconscious.
I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.
I mean, I, I like the idea of leaning in favor of the players, but that seems a bit
of a stretch here.
Um, all right.
Um, so, Xander is currently out of flight.
Lil Jon.
Get him.
Get him dead.
So we're still doing this thing with 20, yeah?
Oh, yeah.
I, I don't actually think it's, it's possible for you to, to do it.
Because of your double proficiency bonus?
Plus eight, so he has to roll, uh.
Well, but it's double proficiency.
Well, that's.
Not his first attack.
That's with the, five.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
So you roll the five, plus eight, 13.
Oh, no.
Jinxed.
Which is a miss.
You have six.
Plus, do you have a luck point?
Do you have a luck point?
I have a luck point.
Jinxed.
Got him.
Derek.
Got him.
All right.
So you, your, uh, your arrow, um, sails through the air and it just.
Sorry.
Misses.
Misses the feature.
Um, you, you had a bead on it, but it suddenly moved at the last moment.
Arthur is, I need you to make a death save.
So that's roll a d20.
And you need to roll above a 10.
Nobody ever rolls once.
Nope.
Uh, 19.
19.
Okay.
So on your character sheet, under your hit points, there is a death saves area.
Okay.
You need to put a check mark next to the plus.
If you get three successes in three rounds, then you stabilize and just stay unconscious.
If you get three failures, then you, before you get three successes, then you're dead.
Okay.
So you've got, if you roll a 20, you get doubles.
You get two successes.
If you roll a one, you get two niggas.
Yeah.
Okay.
So that's the, those are the death and dying rules.
So you're not dead yet.
Yeah.
And Xander is catching his breath.
Mistral, you're up.
All right.
Pop, pop.
On, show.
All right.
It's making your level look a lot more difficult.
Swing with a thunder fist.
I can't see it.
Oh, yeah.
It's an eight.
Um, so eight plus, uh, six.
It's a 14.
14.
14 hits.
It's a magic number.
Yeah.
So, roll that D4 and D6.
All right.
And you double your six damage.
So that's an eight, nine plus four.
So 13 points.
13 points damage.
Okay.
And then.
Are you going to flurry of blows?
Your technique points do refresh on a short rest.
So.
Oh, well then, yeah, let's do it.
I couldn't imagine why we would need a short rest.
Yeah.
Yeah, we're going to do flurry of blows then.
Okay.
Oh, no.
That's a miss.
That'll be a miss.
One more.
Oh, yeah.
Get a second.
That'll get.
13 will hit.
Yep.
Or 13 plus.
Yeah.
Plus your death will get.
Make it into a definite hit there.
Oh, no.
I think one, one.
So, six, seven, 11 points.
11 points.
Okay.
You're so close.
Oh, jeez.
You guys are so close.
Oh, Jezric.
Jezric, it's up to you.
All right.
Well.
We shoot him.
That'll hit.
Yeah.
That'll.
Hey, I think I've done.
This is the most damage I've done.
And I've crit twice.
That's going to be 11.
11 points.
Okay.
Of the piercing damage.
How do you want to have killed him?
Yeah.
Right.
So, Jezric, with his small stature and this tiny thing, he finally, he just gets, he is
at one hit point.
He is staggering after being hit by the breath and then the steam bolt and the giant slam.
So, he's, he is not looking good.
But, uh, as he literally staggers, like, into this thing, he looks up.
He's like, ah, you bastard!
Puts his, his, his, uh, whole, like, the end of the bow, of the crossbow, into the, the,
the mist and fires straight up and it just, there, just right off the top.
And it falls apart in, like, a steam cloud into the ground.
Nice.
All right.
So, it dissipates in the, in a cloud.
Um, and just, and as that happens, you see the entire area where there was, where you
had this mist and this cloud that was surrounding you, that just slowly just starts to fade away.
Um, you do see that it doesn't completely disappear, does disappear further on.
Hmm.
But, so, it's very clear that there might be more of these things here.
But, this cloud, this area, you have, you have purged the demon from within.
Okay.
Um, everybody take 1000 XP.
Ooh.
Which, for those of you keeping track at home, that's enough to level.
Ooh.
Uh, I, I, I did that the last time.
Uh, 39.
900, yep.
I did level last time, so I'm at, my HP should be, two, 1900, nine.
Uh, you should be at 3900.
Yeah.
39.
Yeah.
No, I, like, I, I was, when, when it comes to, like, leveling games, it's more of a punishment
for you not to be able to get XP for times that you're not here.
But, if we're using something that's more of an XP-based game, then if you miss, you're
not getting XP for it.
How much is it?
I'm on level four now.
Yep.
Everybody's level four.
As I catch my breath, I'm gonna walk over and stabilize our friend Arthur here.
Might be a good idea.
For the DC-10 medicine check.
Yep.
Nailed it.
So, if we're leveling up, does that take our XP down to...
No, your XP stays where it is, um, the way that, yeah.
That's true.
That's 3,900 is where you're at.
Okay.
Um, so, everybody should be at level four.
Um, we can, like, either, either way, like, I, I did kind of walk everybody through leveling
separately last time, um, anybody who needed it, but if we, like, if we want to, you guys
can totally, we can totally just wait until the next session level together.
Um, are we rolling for HP, or?
You, the HP roll is, you are rolling for HP, however, if you roll under 50%, you get the
50%.
Yeah.
Okay.
Um, also, I'm going to ritually cast Prayer of Healing, and heal all of us a little bit.
Awesome.
Real good.
Uh, 12 plus four, so everybody heals 16 points.
Nice.
So, so what's, what might help with that?
You will be at 16.
Yeah.
You'll be at 16.
You did that 16?
You just took me back to full.
Good.
Perfect.
I'll be at 16, so I can, uh,
That's a goal.
Roll two, so.
Uh, what, what, okay.
Uh, the, the, the, the, uh, what is it?
The death save?
No.
Oh.
Oh, for leveling up.
So, you're leveling up.
You're.
My max is.
Yeah, so you're going to roll a d10 here, um, for your HP.
Oh, cool.
Uh, not a, not a d20, a d10.
Uh, nope.
That would be nice.
Great thing.
Yeah, roll that one.
Roll that one.
I would love a d20 hit points, three time out of them.
That'd be great.
Right.
Which leveling things are you doing?
80.
Alright.
Alright, so you are going to get, uh, your hit points.
I'm going to add 10 to your max, so you're going to be at 42 max.
All right.
42 max of d10.
So, you need to take a d10, which is.
And then I'm going to do the rest of my leveling.
And if you rolled under a five, from which I think that was, is that a six?
Six.
Yep.
Uh, so you get six plus, uh, your constitution modifier, so three.
So you get nine additional hit points to your max.
Okay.
So instead of 28, you've got 37.
Yes.
37.
I can't do math.
Uh.
Simple math.
No, let's do it.
Well, I didn't want to do 10.
I was like.
Uh.
Well, yeah, I did roll with eight, so.
Right.
Cool, cool, cool.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I'm going to do the rest of my leveling.
All right.
And then he has healed everybody, right?
Yeah, for 16.
For 16.
So.
I think you're, I think you're just at 37.
So your current will go up.
With your, with your mouse.
When you, when you level.
So.
All right.
And with that, that's, uh, that's what we got for tonight.
We did go a little bit over.
Um.
It's 1020.
So.
Um.
But we were, we, like, right there.
Right there.
Yep.
There's that big guy, man.
Yeah.
So.
And make sure that you record your luck points on your character sheets so that.
Come on.
Come on.
Um.
So that you know how much luck you got.
Yeah.
I mean, mine, it's just an ability score.
