![[The anchor’s secret session 00.m4a]]
No planning.
I actually use this pretty heavily.
All right.
So what artifact or relic did you recover from the runes of old Penmaris
that still hums faintly with untamed magic, Derek?
So before this place flooded for some reason and became, like, an island,
how big was it?
Was it still coastal or...?
It was Florida.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
So it was still coastal and all that stuff.
I'm going to say it's, like, this, like, broken compass.
What the heck is a Swedish compass?
It might have some sort of, like, you know, maybe like a star chart on it
or something like that.
And that's sort of the magic that you can see is when you open it up,
it, you know, glows with, like, a little star chart.
Okay.
All right, so you have a star chart compass that you recovered from the wreckage of old Penmaris.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
All right, sounds good.
Thanks, Derek.
Dave, go ahead and give me a roll.
Thirteen.
Thirteen.
Dave, what friend, mentor, or ally did you lose during a mission to secure the harbor?
And what promise did you make in their memory?
Oh, that's 100%.
So, after...
So, after...
Derek's case, the Rebolts.
He wanted to make a forward.
So, after Old Penmaris was in the burning fire of whatever the hell it was called, the Flaming Retribution.
Yes.
Skirk the Kobold got a shitty job working the shitty docks in this district that ended up getting flooded and run over by monsters.
Okay.
And he didn't have a lot of friends, but he did have one, and it was his actual...
It was his dockmaster, like the person in charge of his dock crew.
Okay.
And that's actually what sort of led Skirk into his first rage, is like he saw the guy die, and then Skirk just picked up the nearest thing he could find and started wailing on monsters.
And it was a boat anchor.
Okay.
And so he promised that he's never going...
He will do his best to protect the people around him.
Okay.
Awesome.
Ian, I need you to pick up a d20 and roll.
He can't protect the people.
He cannot protect himself.
No.
No.
I mean, he couldn't protect himself, so...
All right, roll up.
Okay.
Five.
All right, Ian, what oath did you swear to the people or the city that still guides your every choice?
That's pretty good for a paladin.
Yeah, that makes...
You guys have been doing great with these.
Yeah.
What oath did I make?
Hmm.
I...
I made the...
I made the oath to...
If you want some...
If you want some assistance, like...
Yeah.
That's why you're...
I definitely want some assistance here.
Okay.
So, what's your, uh...
What's your paladin's general disposition towards the city?
Um...
Of New Penmaris?
He sees it...
He sees it as better than the...
As the...
Older...
Older city.
Other city.
He thinks it's a new start from what...
It's a fresh start.
Fresh start.
Okay.
So, what sort of oath about...
That...
That sounds like an oath of renewal or an oath of supporting, um...
The...
An oath to support the new...
Yeah, like...
Uh...
He, like, grew up in the previous city.
The regrowth.
Yeah, like, he grew up in the previous city and it was all...
Shitty for him, so...
Okay.
He...
He...
He...
He saw...
He saw the rebuilding and saw an opportunity to...
So, it's a rebirth kind of thing.
Rebirth, yes.
Okay.
To make it better than it...
Than...
Than the other street...
To make it through...
Okay.
I think that's a great oath right there.
Like, I vowed to make new Penmaris.
Penmaris better than...
Old Penmaris.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
And that actually fits in really well with kind of what this adventure is specifically
supposed to be about, so...
Yeah.
All right.
So, there you go.
That...
Does that work for you?
Yeah, that definitely works for you.
Perfect.
Yeah, basically, it took...
It took me a minute, but yes.
No, no, absolutely.
That's...
That's why...
It's a great collaborative story.
That's why we're doing this together, so that we can build it with each other.
I also got a picture ready for...
Shit, I can't read an AI picture.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
All right.
I mean, I gotta very quickly be a very good artist.
Very cool.
Very cool.
This is me.
Nice.
Awesome.
Very cool.
I like it.
All right.
Minus the thing that made that thing change me.
That's post-action.
Fair.
I'll just say fur.
All right.
Fur enough.
Fur enough.
Jason, can you roll a d20 for me?
Yep.
Eight.
All right.
What dangerous salvage did you and your allies recover from a shipwreck off the island's coast?
And what secret did you find aboard?
I'm going to say we found a collection of treasure maps.
Treasure maps.
Oh.
Okay.
Okay.
Treasure.
I like it.
Um...
Can you repeat the second part of the question?
I'm sorry.
What's...
What was it?
A secret?
What dangerous salvage, which is the treasure maps.
Those are definitely dangerous salvage.
Um...
Did you and your allies recover from a shipwreck off the island's coast?
And what secret did you find aboard?
Hmm.
Hmm.
Um...
Sorry.
All right.
Joseph.
All right.
I'm going to call in for some help on this one once I get a secret to go with some treasure
maps.
Because treasure maps don't sound super dangerous now that you read the question.
Well, like, the danger could have been, like, the actual salvage itself, right?
Like, you had to go out to, you know, this area where, you know, there's monster-infested
waters.
And...
You could also put the secret to how the stuff started, too.
How this whole world reset.
The whole apocalypse happened.
And the dangerous thing, uh, about the treasure maps, it's like, maps are not dangerous.
Treasure maps?
Dangerous.
Like, the secret and the danger could both be, like, whose treasure it is.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Like, it's some big high-flued number.
Yeah, or what's guarding it, or something like that.
Or both.
Yeah.
Okay, so maybe, maybe the maps, the secret as part of the maps lead to what caused the
destruction of the old city.
Okay.
Okay.
The other thought I had was, like, they are, you are not the only one who is looking for
those treasure maps, and you found them first.
So someone else is, like, some powerful person or organization is also hunting for them, and they
have recently found out that, like, the danger is that somebody knows that you have them.
That's like, so my background is criminal as well.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, that, yeah.
Mm-hmm.
You stole them.
Thief.
Thief.
Thief.
No, he salvaged them legitimately.
He salvaged them legitimately.
Right.
He salvaged them legitimately.
Yes.
Yes.
Liar.
Maritime law.
Right.
So, what do you think?
All right.
Yeah, so you're saying basically the secret would be, I'm not the only one that's looking
for them.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, I like that idea.
Maybe the treasure doesn't necessarily have a secret itself, or it does, you just don't
know what it is yet.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, I mean, these questions are not straightforward on purpose, so you can interpret them in
any direction that you want to.
Yeah, I like that.
All right.
Awesome.
So, you found some treasure maps in a shipwreck off the coast of the island, and those treasure
maps are somebody, are what go to an old family or a pirate organization, a strong pirate organization,
and they're on the lookout for those maps.
And you know that they're on the lookout for them.
Yeah.
That sounds good.
Awesome.
Okay.
Cool.
Ramsey?
Oh, I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
All right.
You're good.
Eighteen.
Eighteen.
Eighteen.
What if it looks funny?
Five.
What twice?
What perilous experiment or ritual did you help contain before it could engulf a section
of the city?
Ooh.
Oh.
Oh.
Hmm.
You trust me.
How long ago was the invasions in the docks?
Was that relatively recent?
Six months, right?
The Tidewatch Ward was taken over six months ago.
No.
Okay.
Okay.
So plenty of time there.
Plenty.
Plenty.
Plenty of time there.
So where is something in reaction to that?
I'm going to say that I was brought in, I'm thinking like some kind of attempt to like
erect like a barrier or a shield, you know, to protect the rest of the city.
And it went long.
It went south.
I don't want to do that.
I don't want to do that.
Um.
I don't want to do that.
Um.
Yeah.
Maybe, um, maybe the idea was to, uh, kind of use the, the surrounding, uh, the sea itself
to create like, uh, like a, like a, like a, a, like a, like a, like a wall of water or, you
know what I mean?
Like something.
Um.
And instead it wound up like flooding or tsunami style, like hit.
It didn't necessarily destroy, but you know, wreaked havoc on another part of the city.
Okay.
All right.
Cool.
I like it.
I like it.
Um, all right, Ryan.
Well, two.
Two.
Two.
Man, that was a lot, that was a lot of action for two.
One.
I was like, I was like, come on, show me the 20.
Two.
Go ahead and reroll it.
That one we already did.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Two.
Four.
Four.
Yeah.
Four.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was like, I was like, come on, show me the 20.
Two.
Go ahead and reroll it.
That one we already did.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Two.
Four.
Four.
Four.
Four.
All right.
Get those bad rules all the way down.
Yeah, exactly.
Perfect.
So Ryan, um, what group of workers or refugees did you protect when a half finished district
collapsed during the building?
Uh.
And at this point you can feel free to make anything up.
Well, I helped say the ship builders.
Okay.
Who are trying to repair and build small ships to get fishing back online after the great,
what do we call this thing?
The flaming retribution.
Retribution.
Yeah.
What, what were, what did you protect them from?
Were they under attack by, what, was it something natural disaster?
Uh.
Did, um, did some sea monsters do something or?
Uh, metal, a magic metal shield that helped them not burn down from the flames that were
still persistent.
Okay.
So they can go fishing.
Okay.
Bring food into the village.
So after, after shock, like fire, fire raining.
Fire, things are still kind of out, the outskirts of the.
Okay.
Yeah.
Cool.
Yeah.
I like it.
Shock way where the.
Nice.
Piece of it.
So they want to go fishing.
So they can bring home food.
Awesome.
I like it.
Perfect.
Okay.
So that's the first part.
Now we've got the, now we've got the connections piece.
So I'm going to go ahead and start off with, uh, Ian and Dave.
Mm-hmm.
Um, one of you roll a d20.
Back four.
20.
Oh, man.
Starting stronger.
He's going to get a plus one to one of our stats, right?
That's a perfect way to set it up here.
No, um, okay.
So, Ian and Dave, your characters.
Were handpicked by the same counselor or guild master.
For your courage in defending others.
What past deed.
Earned their faith in both of you.
That and what mission.
Did they entrust you with now?
Hmm.
What past deed.
How long have you been a paladin?
How long have you been a paladin?
I've been a paladin since I was, since I was 13.
Okay.
So it's entirely possible that you were.
I've been, I've been training under, training to be a paladin.
Yeah.
To be a paladin, yeah.
So it's entirely possible you were at the original, like, for some reason you were at
the dock during the original Tidewatch invasion.
Yeah.
It's possible.
I like the idea, and tell me what you think of this, of like, we pretty visibly beat the
shit out of some big monster that was, like, during the invasion that nobody else sort
of had the courage to face.
We're like, nah, we got this.
Yeah, I could, I could see that.
Okay.
I was thinking about maybe helping a famine, but yeah, I could definitely see that.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know, I, I, I would do, yeah, I would do that, yeah.
All right.
And then what have they chose, what was the second part of the question?
And what mission did they entrust you with now?
What side quest has the, has the counselor entrusted both of you with?
I'm so tempted to say, recovering some treasure maps, but I'm not gonna say that.
Do you have, do you have a mission in mind, Ian?
Yeah, I think I do.
Yeah.
Like, like, how big is this island?
Huge.
Huge?
Yeah.
Is there, like, another, like, farming town out there, like, that having monster problems?
Um, well, it's not, like, there, there's a refuge, like, there's a refugee quarter,
and it's not really a quarter, it's so much as, like, just surrounding the city.
So there's, like, basically just this huge ring of tent, of, like, tent slums.
Yeah.
It's more or less, I wanted to, I wanted to help some, a food crisis, like, that, like,
I don't know.
Well, so here's, here's something at least to consider with this.
The, the concept of this, of this specific game, is for you to be going into this, into
this ghost quarter.
Ah.
This, the, the ghost, the Tidewatch Ward, and, and start clearing it out, and, you know.
Okay.
So, the mission should be something to do with the Tidewatch Ward.
Okay.
Really, if you're going to have it work into this adventure.
Okay.
Wait, wait, I, I, I think, can, can we make a, can they make a minor demon lord or something?
Yeah.
Yeah, can we, like, we had to, we had to face a, a hidden demon that was summoned.
Okay.
There's, there's, there's, apparently a demon that was summoned, and it fled to the Tidewatch
Ward, and it's your jobs to go and destroy it.
I like this plan.
So.
Why did I agree to this?
I don't know.
Hey, I thought it was cool.
No, it is cool, it's a cool idea, I'm just saying, why did my character agree to this?
It seems like.
Cause it's barbarian, barbarian smash.
That's true.
Yeah.
All right.
All right.
Um.
They have a resistance demon, right?
Yeah.
Right.
All right.
Uh, Ryan and Ramsey.
I'll call.
One of you guys rule a 20.
What?
Two.
Two.
Two.
Man.
You are strong.
You like those twos, Ryan.
Well, you, you are using, you are using my dice and those D20s are notoriously bad rules.
So, um, it's probably something I shouldn't be admitting to as the GM.
Um.
You can hold them as the DM.
Yeah.
I'm sure.
Um, okay.
So two.
You worked side by side rescuing survivors from a capsized ferry near the harbor mouth.
Who is quick thinking saved the most lives?
And how did you celebrate after?
Ah.
I'm surprised you.
We went back to the room.
The underground tavern was still intact and the bartender was still there to serve us drinks.
All right.
That's how we celebrated.
Sounds good.
All right.
I love that the celebration was determined before the deed.
Well, obviously.
That's the first part.
That's the most important part.
Is the celebration.
Yeah.
So we found the last remaining underground tavern.
So, out of...
Who's quick thinking?
Yeah.
Who's quick thinking?
Shaved were rescuing people to the ferry?
Yes.
I would imagine it's probably going to be more of a ranger than a cleric.
All right.
As far as, you know, if you plop the ferry, I don't know if you have anything in mind specifically.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Ryan the ranger did amazing things with the ferry and the cleric supported.
What's up your skill list, Ryan?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I can do, uh, insight.
Read this thing here.
No one needs glasses at this table.
Nope.
Nope.
Everyone here is not...
Investigation.
Persuasion.
I think that's what that says.
Light of hand.
Okay.
I just wondered if there was a skill that we could weave into that.
I mean, like, you could have decided it was good to, like, collapse the mast or something
and, you know, make it like a bridge.
Yeah.
There you go.
From the sinking ferry to land.
That works.
Is it alright?
Yeah.
How did, uh, how did, how did the cleric sit into that?
Um, good question.
You afraid?
Just like...
Oh, that's a pretty, that's a pretty easy answer.
Um...
Turn the ladder to stone?
Turn the ladder to stone?
It was.
Uh, it was at night.
The light.
So, for one thing, yes.
I, I was able to, uh, provide, uh, to buy the light, uh, to, to help.
Um, and then also, uh, you know, feeling and taking care of the injured afterwards.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mostly.
Um...
I, I will say that, in our celebrations, though, that, um, my character Xander, uh, who
I also, uh, do to the mishap, uh, with the, the ritual, um, behind his back, uh, people
have started referring to him as Flooded Waker.
Okay.
Anyway, um, Xander is very stoic.
And as he got drunk with you that night, um, you realize that it is less stoicism and
more just being withdrawn and being, um, melancholy.
Well, it comes across to stoicism because he's kind of a weird, divine-looking dude.
So, he's a depressed cleric?
Yup.
And he got quite drunk because he was matched, matched the amount of beards that I was drinking,
but I'm seven foot one and 350 pounds.
Oh, man.
So...
Jesus, I'm a big dude.
I ain't that bad.
I'm a big orc.
So, he's...
Very small over here.
Nice.
So, he's very small over here.
Alright, cool.
Yeah, he had the small boy side of the table.
So, who's...
So, I'm about to say, hey, this is him.
Well, he's, he's an orc.
So, he's gonna be tall.
Um, we...
We're like three and a half feet.
Yeah.
Keep in mind, we have no humans here.
So, nobody's actually human-sized, I don't think.
Um, well, the elf might be.
Yeah, the elf.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um, but, uh, Derek and Jason, why don't you roll a d20?
Go ahead, sir.
That's it.
Ten.
Ten.
Ten.
Oh, my God.
Alright.
You shared command of a volunteer squad restoring order after a magical storm.
How did your different strengths make you an unstoppable team?
Mug Mechanist.
Go.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
We shared command of a what?
A squad.
A squad of volunteers.
Okay.
During a storm.
Yep.
Well...
Um...
Charisma's not my strong suit.
Yeah, no.
So...
No.
Command is...
You lead by example, not by...
Yeah, we lead by...
Yep.
That's how you get done.
That's how you get done.
So, um...
This storm...
We're...
We're...
We're...
Obviously, we're just, like, caught out, or...
Yeah.
There...
There are a number of magical storms that have started showing up throughout...
Uh...
Uh...
Past year.
Um...
The worst of which...
Being involved with that constant storm that's over at the Tidewatch Ward.
But...
Okay.
There are a bunch of other ones that pop up from time to time.
Okay.
So, um...
I...
Can...
Do...
Pretty good at, like, making constructions from my...
My stone...
Heritage.
Okay.
Um...
So, I imagine I start to build, like, you know, a refuge for the group of people.
Okay.
That we can outlast the storm.
Not so much, like, push through it, but, you know, like, bunker down and...
Mm-hmm.
And hold it out.
Um...
But...
In order to do that, I would need, you know, some amount of materials.
And a monk seems like he's fast, right?
Yep.
Yeah.
Can it help?
Perfect.
I also have a little bit of magic, too.
Well, even better.
Yeah.
He is...
He does have cloud heritage, which means he has...
He has a cantrip and...
He has access to a cantrip and will eventually get a first level spell, so...
Okay.
Um...
So, he's a magical monk.
Okay.
Perfect, perfect.
All right.
So, there's some sort of...
Some sort of, like, synergy where, like, you're building...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He's providing...
Yeah.
He's providing magical and physical support to get you there.
Just imagine with Mickey Mouse and Fantasia where he's, like, taking water.
Yeah.
Yep.
No.
All right.
Cool.
Well, um...
I was going to have everybody answer one more question, but we have three minutes before
10.
So, uh, we'll just call it at that.
Um...
I do have...
A little bit of homework, but hopefully it's not all that bad.
Um...
If you guys can think about, like, two contacts, people not in this group, that you, um, that
your character is connected to, whether it's a rival, a friend, um, so, you know, a, a shop
worker that, a shop owner that you constantly go back in, that you constantly hang out at their
place or whatever, um, just come up with something that, that kind of connects your, your character
to the world.
Do not feel like you have to have that completely fleshed out.
You can come, you can come to me with a basic concept of, like, you know, say, you know, you
want to be connected to an April O'Neil kind of person or whatever, you know, if you've got a
pop culture reference for your contact, that's perfectly fine.
Um, so, I want you to feel like you have to build out this entire backstory for them.
Um, also, yeah, if you, as you're building out your, or as you're at, before the next session,
if you have any ideas about additional backstory things that you would like for your character
to have, um, please do, um, throw those out on Discord or let me know about them.
Um, I, when, when I'm building, when I'm building these adventures in the, in the world, I actively
try to incorporate people's backstories into the actual story itself.
So, the more information I have, the more I can do that, and the more fun and engaging
it will be for you to see your character actually make an impact on, in, in, on their stuff.
So, um, if, if you, if you're into that, feel free to send that to me.
If you don't send it to me, that's fine.
We'll still have fun.
We'll still play a game and it will be a blast.
So, don't, don't feel like you have to do that.
But if that's something that you think will be really fun, then just give me the info so I can do it.
Yeah, I'm going to be, I'm going to be looking for more of my backstory.
Oh yeah, absolutely.
Thank you.
