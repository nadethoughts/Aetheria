# Session TranscriptAlright, so, when last we met, we had the three dwarves, Demlur, Urik, and Hurgen, meet with the king.
The king informed you that he has lost communications with one of the colonies that he established in the Overworld,
after the Flaming Retribution destroyed the Overland.
And it's been a year since the Flaming Retribution, and he had pushed out some colonies, and one of the colonies went silent.
You went to the colony of Daggersheath, and discovered that the village itself was not destroyed,
but there were a great many people that were missing, and a great many dead bodies.
It looked like a large battle had taken place in there.
Upon further investigation, you found some large-sized footprints in your investigations.
You were tracking, trying to figure out what was going on, and you found some really large-sized footprints
that seemed out of place, considering the size of the dwarf.
You saw some smoke rising in the distance towards the mine that was created for this town.
This is a mine.
This is a mine.
This is a mine.
This is a mining town.
And so you went towards the mine, and found a couple of rats scurrying around in the mine area.
Those rats were of unusual size.
They were a lot larger than a typical rat would be, about the size of a dwarf.
And they looked like they were made out of molten lava.
You then went and dispatched said rats, suspecting that they might be the...
...the enemies that had caused this destruction, perhaps.
And at that moment, after you had killed all the rats, you heard some phrases coming out of the mines.
With three separate voices.
Two large and bolsterous voices, although they don't necessarily seem to be too intelligent.
And then a third that sounded more intelligent.
Um...
And, uh, referenced the masters.
Those groups, uh, those people appeared to be looking for something.
Uh, the actual phrases that were said was,
I not know where it go.
This cave is too small.
Yes, why stumpies make things so small?
Quiet, fools.
Your master and mine will not be pleased unless we find the creature.
And as you hear those voices, you see emerging from the...
From one of the tunnels of the cave, a, um, two ogres, and one...
And one creature that looks like a dwarf, but is not a dwarf.
Um, and that dwarf, or that dwarf-like creature also, um, appears to have some sort of flaming visage.
Um, so it looks like it's...
Its beard looks like it's made out of...
Actually, it's a female dwarf.
Um, but its hair looks like it's made out of, um, made out of flame.
Um, it appears to be red-hot.
Um, and the, um, ogres, which are the two...
the two larger creatures appear to be giving it a wide berth um as far as ogres are concerned you
guys don't really have like ogres don't really have a lot of organization they're not very
intelligent um so they don't they are more more like followers rather than leaders in as far as
like just overall um personality and that kind of thing so it's not unusual that they would be
following the lead of this creature but you're not quite sure what this creature is um as far as
other things um i have a i have updated the quests section to have a specific quest that you guys are
following um it is investigate the silence of the dagger sheep um so that is your active quest at
the moment um i've also updated the story with um the previous with a you know a description of the
previous um
of the previous session so you can reference that as well um and i did also in the map section move
the marker for the party down to the dagger sheath so you guys are over there um i think
those are all the updates that i have made so with that um they have walked out of the um out of the
cave they have not noticed you yet but they will in one action's time so i am going to give you
guys all
one
action that you can spend before you're noticed by these characters um what do you do uh hide
all right so go ahead and roll me a stealth
action uh no not actions where am i stealth there's a stealth
where did my dialogue box go well i've done better uh it was almost a 14
stupid flipping over to a six couldn't even get for the nine we're on
oh um if you went to the map and hit the back button your interface will have disappeared
i haven't fixed that yet so just go ahead and refresh your screen okay so just don't you did
roll a 20 yeah oh sick all right so you are we all hiding no you can do whatever you want
yeah you could do whatever you want you have one action that you can spend i was i just don't
remember i don't remember a big spot to be hidden
um
you guys may be fine
there's yeah there are enough things that you that you can arguably hide behind that you know
you can you can feel free to do that or you can choose to just charge and attack or you can choose
to um try and hail them and talk your way talk your ingratiate yourself with them you have a
number of different actions that that you can attempt to do um is my hunt prey like available
to turn on quickly that's an action right that is an action uh it is not an action it is not an action
so it's completely random but you can of course go home you can notebook it on point wg so you were
on point number two is she's not on from last time so you would have to use your hunt pre you'd have
to choose one of the creatures and um and activate your hemp pray which might not be a bad idea abuse
out virtual agent you chose to hide okay everybody else is doing it chris well just because everybody
else is doing it doesn't mean that you need to if everybody jump if everybody jumped off the empire
state building would you do it too bill was burning probably enough yeah all right so good man all right
all right so let's go ahead and move on over to the abandoned mine oh yeah okay so emilor
and hergen you guys are able to successfully hide so move your move your pog to some place where
these uh creatures will not see you who is that uh not you yeah yeah okay i mean you did attempt
to hide so you could move to a place to hide but your uh your hide score your hide was not
sufficient not great i feel pretty good right where i'm at i'm behind this little blasted out
piece of gate i can't move all right i can't drag myself just or maybe not hiding maybe uh setting
up a tactical ambush that sounds better well that's what i was wondering before you say anything
chris could i be like down here but i feel like that's way too close to everybody i i think that
that would that that exceeds your movement um to be able to have gone all the way down there
that's a piece of cake
he's a rubble like right here but yeah you could go to that rubble right there that ramsay pointed
out that's close-ish and then demlor did you just kind of back in behind the uh behind the gates
uh yeah i mean yeah my best all right is limitedly visible as possible that was okay since i'm not
hiding i guess maybe get some cover you are hiding just because you're not successful doesn't mean
you're not doing it you are hiding oh um yeah yes all right so um both okay so doesn't look like
there's anything that you get for
critically succeeding for the hide but uh ruric you are hidden and argan you are hidden as well
that's looking beautiful okay and demlor uh you are not hidden but are concealed at least for now
um they they stop um as you get you guys all scurry around find find places to hide um and
you and you sit back and you wait to see what happens as they have their discussion um this uh
ogre is going to be the last one to be killed by the ogre so they're going to be the last one to be killed by the ogre so
stops and looks directly at dem directly at dem lore's hiding place and says i'll get out here
maybe this it and starts moving your direction uh let's go ahead and roll initiative how do i
roll stealth for initiative chris right so for those of you that used your stealth um i think
it's uh i'm going to if you would like you don't have to roll initiative separately um we can just
use the roll that you made um but if you uh but if you do want to use stealth for your initiative
uh i think you really have to open the character sheet um and then in the initiative section
there's a drop down that lets you switch attributes um from the character sheet ah okay
oh yeah i see it cool oh no jason apparently had a big body boom make a body boom that's what it
looks like so no bueno um so let's see here i forgot that i'm already injured so maybe i shouldn't
be where i'm at
ah
that's probably fine maybe fortune favors the bold i do want to talk to you chris about how
many weapons i can hold i'd like to have a bow at some point uh you can hold as many weapons as
well you can have equipped as many weapons as you can carry uh without hurting your um
without hurting your uh incumbency or whatever it's called yeah your encumbrance you can hold
only one two-handed weapon which is what a bow and arrow would be or two one-handed weapons but
right
i think i'm back am i back yay you're back oh good all right so jason um i'm gonna need you to roll
initiative and you can choose to roll either your stealth as your initiative or your perception
because you're trying to sneak all righty investing right good um i think we'll go here here we are
ah yes we're off to a glorious evening here of rolling low numbers
oh you do have hero points that you can spend for those role for those low numbers yeah
so please do remember yeah all right something you know valuable say you want to shoot me before
i get a chance to talk to him it's fine so now it is time we're going to go ahead and start off with
uh rurik hey rurik well i do believe uh the best thing that rurik can do in this situation
is to just pull myself out of initiative right so that is what we are going to do i think that's a
okay so next we're going to have this ogre mm-hmm
and he's gonna move forward like that and he's going to target emlar oh
and he's gonna fling a javelin well that's not great i do not have anything to say about that
that's a long fling it is he is out of range but he's still going to try do you have anything that
you want to do in response to that mc oh no no no sorry i do not have anything to say about that i
wish i did i thought you were i thought you were no no looking at something all right oh he knows very well all right
not well enough uh so he so you are you are currently concealed because of yourself so he
did succeed in the attack in the flat check but uh he because you are behind cover he was not able
to hit well it's not just because you were behind cover um because he was so far far behind so he
flings the javelin and it hits the ground uh about five feet in front of you but uh demler you're
pretty sure that they spotted you yeah um yeah oh we have a hurgan next so hurgan you are up
excellent i think i'm gonna reinsert myself after hurgan okay this dude hasn't gone no i don't know
what to do in a sense should i go towards this guy i'm afraid that he's gonna lambast me well
maybe i mean he's gonna try but yeah i mean he is a level appropriate enemy so which means
might hit you
might do a lot of damage or might not so oh have we given up on talking to i mean not the orcs but
this other person i mean for now probably i am bro just you know and called the stompies can't
let that stand that is true chris help me remember what is my length i can move 20 you can move 25
feet i will which i think is already on my sheet so i'm not going to take it off yeah you have you
have a hunt prey action so you run
up is this far enough that's fine okay so you target him and run up with your axes out with
your axe and your warhammer out what do you do i forgot how to play um how do i swing both of them
uh there is a well actually um there but there's the twin takedown which takes one action and you
can swing with both your weapons there's actually a macro that i just that i put on your on your uh
on your hud it looks like two blue swords
you click on that that will initiate a twin takedown macro which should just run the run the
twin takedown automation for you um you also have to pick your which hand has your hammer and which
hand has your axe and that kind of thing but yeah but one of them gets like less power right right
and but the the twin takedown take the twin takedown macro could walk you through everything
okay and i'm i'm you said hud and i think that's the stuff along the bottom but i don't see two
swords right um okay well
let me unless i'm missing something so it should be like if you look at the thing at the bottom
right where on the uh on the left hand side there are a bunch of buttons on there one of the buttons
should be like this blue thing you see that um i really wish i did and i'm sorry um okay no it's
that's that's not your fault um give me one second and i should be able to like my whole thing was
like minimized before over to the left and then i had to click on it and it kind of opened up again
and i see this basic action macro but it's just like this golden no that that's in the wrong
spot it's above um it's above that just sorry guys i've run over my phone i'm not sure i guess
i wasn't exactly following every uh directive here but you you don't need to um so scott i just
dropped a macro in in the uh in the chat if you just hold that over where should i put it in one
of those slots put in one of the slots any one of those slots anything that looks like a button you
can drop it into okay i have war hacks and now i have a war hammer multiple attack penalty do i
have to do that um let me see here my options are two and i have a war hammer and i have a war hammer
no map map minus five and map minus ten so you're at no map because you have not attacked yet okay
so that's what that's for if it was like first or second okay yeah so if you use twin takedown
multiple times did something and bam all right so you hit with you hit with one of them i'm
assuming just roll damage on the 21 instead of the 13 yep yeah roll damage on the 21 um yeah and
you miss with the 13 all right so you run up with your uh with your axes
and uh war hammer you bury your ass into the leg of the ogre and swing back and swing around with
your war hammer to kind of hit both of them but the war hammer bounces off the the armor of the
ogre but your axe your axe carries home dealing 10 points of damage and that's my turn yep so
that's the end of your turn um oh shoot with the wrong button i still don't see how hunt prey helps
me yeah hunt prey helps you
in that it makes every multiple attack penalty that you have significantly smaller so every but
like you so basically um your flurry ranger which is what you are is designed to do a bunch of
attacks like he's designed to just kind of like hit hit hit hit hit hit hit hit hit so the more
attacks that you so um the hunt prey for you specifically reduces your multiple attack penalty
from a negative five per swing to a negative three per swing so
you're more likely to hit with all of your other attacks that you that you're swinging with all right
so it didn't apply this one okay right right well it did apply because you did have because one of
your uh your second attack was at a negative three i see okay so all right cool next up
i started blasting all right um yes i would very much like to shoot this fellow um yeah yeah okay
can i
oh
oh
oh
dirt dirt dirt figured it out okay um and i need to remember to add this um because it's not
taking into account my expert for some reason all right uh yeah so anyway i started blasting
with some fire rounds oh oh oh dear oh dear seven i don't it does still hit it does but
ah yeah it's fine we ain't gonna get we ain't gonna get all greedy uh all right cool yep precision
one
shot one kill all of the various bull crap oh and eight sounds good the four and the two
last one my shotgun um all right cool uh so that's one hmm i suspect hergan may need
some assistance soon five um where can i get no longer hidden as well oh correct very correct
there's not anywhere
i can get really um all right so i think what i'm going to do get him again that's kind of what i'm
thinking um he's almost dead maybe i'll shoot the other guy i mean that's not a great shot but this
dude well he's got persistent on him but yeah one down all right we're gonna try it we're gonna we're
gonna try it right so i'm gonna do my um uh my reload action so i'm gonna stealth i'm gonna duck
behind the cover and reload by making this here stealth roll um and i'm going to uh i'm gonna hit
him with when i reload i'm just gonna reload a normal shot this time not the special fire shot
minus five uh probably not nope i ain't gonna do it um you missed yep yep so that was your second
shot yeah yeah yeah yep that's fine all right i am out of actions then that is me all right so
what you guys do know
is that an 18 hit him and a 15 missed him well that is correct all right so the second ogre's
turn he's going to is there a reason why i cannot do anything with my character because we're in
combat and it's not your character's turn how do i get it to like measure a distance um i can't do
that until it's up around the person there's a ruler in the upper left hand corner the measurement
control that'll you have to have that active in order to be able to measure distance but you
should be able to have
at least like put your like just hover over a guy and see how far away that is i just didn't want to
necessarily go for a guy so it doesn't let me do much yeah there's a measured measure distance the
ruler should get it for you uh chris i don't mean to be that guy but were these guys off guard since
i was hiding from them they were not off guard so you're right you do hit him oh sick um yeah so go
ahead and roll damage on that yeah big bada boom this is my boom stick
excellent love to see it so you have one dead ogre and then another other that is going to
be attempting to attack her again it's his battleaxe
um
he's going to DAYUMB minions
나오는
of toward ti
their young
floating before you get started before you get started i want you to um no just just do your
thing sorry um okay um as a as a um kineticist anything that comes across as elemental you can
um do a um you can do a recall knowledge on it um because it's kind of like in your wheelhouse
yeah so um not that other people couldn't do that as well but um i might have a little bit more
better right area yeah okay right um so right but this flashy thing that's five feet how do i make
that go away after i tried to measure something it showed up and i i haven't figured out how to
make it go goodbye bye or go where it belongs there you go oh thanks so this big feller is
d-e-d um and so he just took a whiff at her again that seems quite quite
unusual
unkind hurricane has been very lucky this battle he hasn't well everybody's been very lucky this
battle no hits have occurred so all right i'm going to do that and see what is this oh hey
look at now i'm moving um maybe if i go here okay that seems like you know kind of trying to flank
a fellow might be advantageous for somebody so we're gonna we're gonna do this and then we're
going to attack the question is how do i attack um given that you are in melee you're probably
going to be doing
a um an elemental blast i would think yeah that sounds um and you would do and you also want to
probably do a two-action elemental blast as that does more damage a two-action elemental blast will
add your strength and your con to your melee attack okay i think i'm doing it we'll find out
if i screw it up i found out oh yay hey i need to do that again uh no you hit okay i mean unless
you want to re-roll a hit
but no i just i just want to make sure i'm doing it right if i was going to do the so the two
action isn't like two hits it's just one action one thing that i'm doing it just takes two actions
to do it right um we all right we hit uh we'll go ahead and do damage um it looks like you did
use a one action elemental blast not a two action elemental blast said it's got the two things in
there what did i do well let's just let's just roll the damage and and if you're mine and if
you're done then i'll just add your con to the damage so no big deal uh do i need to change uh no
base damage stays the same it says acid but that's it's not actually being applied right so that
doesn't matter yeah i know it's really confusing that is that is something that isn't added to your
damage at all yeah okay no until you press the add button it's not your damage and i feel like
i have this conversation pretty consistently you probably do and i apologize for not learning
well it's it's not just you like it confuses everybody right
it's not you being dead um okay so it does look like you um does look like you didn't uh you didn't
do two action one so i'm going to apply this damage and i'm going to add four to it and in
order to do a two action elemental blast um if you're doing it from the from the hud at the bottom
if you click on the actions where you see the elemental blast header there's a one roman numeral
one and a roman numeral two there so in the
basic action macros right that's what you're talking about no no um in the so um in so in the
top um the top of the hud there's a button that looks like a sword if you click on the button
that looks like a sword um it'll have all of your attacks uh okay the double swords nope the double
swords bring me to our attack order so that's not what we're talking about not okay so look at the
bottom of your screen uh at the bottom where you're
see your okay where you see your your uh character picture okay i see my character picture it's got
dem lore at the top if you follow that line to the right you'll see a graduation cap some feet
a person with the halo and then a sword no i do not see any of that are you are you looking at
your character sheet or are you looking at the hud at the bottom of the screen so uh yeah like
you said on the bottom just above the the buttons down there right i have a picture of my character
i'm going to call it a rook and then a person running and maybe the uh glows of your brain look
look above that uh-huh just above that i have a player character list yeah a list of players
with a latency 27 ms or fps 30 oh um move move that i'm gonna trust give me a second here i'm
gonna take a screenshot and i'm going to you are probably not seeing the same thing i am
so we will see if you are seeing the same thing i am so we will see if you are seeing the same thing i am
thing that i am but um i just i'm not sure so um nice i would take a screenshot of my screen
you can totally do that i just in discord i just sent you or i just in in the discord chat channel
i just sent a screenshot um and it's got a red box around the thing that i'm what that i want
you to click in it with an arrow on it do you see that um cracked granite general uh no it's in the
well i i'll put it in the crack granite general channel
it's probably easier to easier to see it over there okay so i just sent it out yeah no no it
doesn't look like that at all okay the only thing i have to me is the one to zero boxes and then i
have a picture of my guy but all of the the the rook the person running the eyeball blue glasses
fist that is over top of him if i hover on him only none of this other stuff is anywhere in
there but gone in click on my guy okay that brings up stuff yes clicking on him does stuff
okay
there we go and it also opens my character sheet nice okay okay i see that now i um the sword yes
i see the sword and i get fine if you click on the sword and you see the elemental blasts in there
uh in the in the header there's a roman numeral one and a roman numeral two if you click on the
roman numeral two when you're doing your elemental blast that'll do it to action elemental blast
so oh yeah okay moving forward all right thank you so sorry yeah no problem oh no no worries i
not really sure how to do all the things and i don't think that collapsed like that yeah i think
that was a pretty new feature so yeah i don't remember it being collapsed ever before like i
remember having it up there and looking at it looking with it but okay i did some damage i hit
it just before it kills me um that was two uh two of my three actions and moving there was the third
so right i am i've expired okay this guy um is going to that's not going to be helpful
uh it's going to
it's not gonna go that way it's gonna go this way and it is going to
jason just set his computer shut off again oh my gosh um he's gonna target her again
and it's going to fling a fling a light hammer so it's what throw him it pulls out it it has a
light hammer and it flings it at you don't die don't die and he and uh the hammer hits you or
eight points of fire damage oh
fire now uh you are not on fire um and she says something like fools stop swinging at it and
actually hit it so she moved a couple times to get up there yeah all right next up we got her again
you're up so my haunt pray thing stays on right it just switches over to this other organ uh yeah
i think that uh i think that's that's the way i read it yeah it just says when she shifted
to shift to a new person yeah yeah so is this person flanked uh it is
I believe it's not fully flanked at this point.
Like, you would need to be one square down or two squares down to flank.
Is it worth it to do that, or should I just try to hit it three different times?
I would say it's worth it to do that, because you're more likely to hit it.
And you could do your twin takedown twice, which is still four attacks.
Let me just check and make sure that...
You are not currently flanking, so if you want to go down one more, that'll get you to your flank.
Okay, try it again.
Swing, do it again.
Yep.
Alright, so you hit with one.
Oh, wait.
Never mind.
No, wait, wait, wait.
Oops.
Oh, that's fine.
I misread the thing.
You were flanking the other one, so if you want to be in that other spot, you can totally be in that other spot.
I just misread the card.
And your first attack was a better attack, so I would go with your first one.
So, do that damage, then?
Is that what you're saying?
Yeah.
So, on your first attack, you missed with your first weapon, but you critted with your second weapon.
So, roll critical damage on that.
The 24.
Okay.
Yeah.
The 24.
Oh, my gosh.
Are you kidding me?
And now, if you want to do a second twin takedown, then you need to do that, and then just choose the map, the map two, and then you can do a second twin takedown.
Why not?
Nice.
Those both look like hits, so roll damage for both of them.
Oh, jeez.
Yeah.
That's what you're supposed to be doing.
That's awesome.
Oh!
Oh!
Max damage.
Oh!
Yowzer.
Alright.
I was distracting him on one side while you're killing him from the back.
Beautiful.
And he does.
He basically slices, dices, and tenderizes the ogre.
Is there any special way you wish to have killed this thing?
Hammer to the nuts.
Sword to the chest.
We're low people.
They're big people.
They're big people.
Yeah, yeah.
So, you hammer its nuts so hard that it lifts off the ground, and then hack it in the chest,
and then it basically just kind of stumbles.
It stumbles around, acting like it's about to grab its junk, and just falls completely
unconscious.
Hopefully not on my friend.
These are big people.
They are big people.
Would those guys have counted as giant at all, or is that just a totally different class?
These are not giants, but they are a giant type.
Excellent.
I'm just wondering if it would have affected that feat that I have on strategy, I think.
You were not able to hide from the azer.
Okay.
That is fine.
Take a step, and then action three, and we shoot.
Oh, when I reloaded, though, I definitely reloaded some cold bullets this time.
Get her.
All right, so she's not off guard, but that's all right.
She was in range now.
Don't forget to plus two.
And the hero points did hit.
Rurik, you are getting an additional hero point.
Okay.
All right.
Ouch.
Oh, that looks like a crit.
Very good.
That's probably going to be pretty good.
I'm guessing that's going to be pretty nice.
Oh, jeez.
Oh, that cold damage.
Oh, my gosh.
Get wrecked.
I didn't even see how much damage was that altogether.
A lot.
Is that 29?
It was 29 damage.
Okay.
Sick.
Blam.
Wow.
Plus persistent cold damage.
And I'll say, oh, they ain't hitting anyone anymore.
Should we try to talk?
I will.
If you want to.
Yeah.
She makes some sort of oath against you that you don't quite understand.
And Demler, you are up.
And that would be the time where I'd want to do that knowledge thingy.
Like, what can I make of this chick?
Although I'm not trying to, like, die.
Yeah.
So this is just one of your actions.
So you have other actions that you can use.
If you click on the basic action macros,
the one,
and target her.
Target her.
I click on the basic macros.
On the third column of that basic macro thing,
there's a recall knowledge.
Click on that.
I clicked it.
That will give me everything I need to know.
You are unable to figure out what this thing is.
It's definitely something from the elemental plane,
but that's the elemental plane of fire.
But that's about all that you've got.
As far as we're going?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, actually,
I will say that you do recognize what it is.
You just don't have any additional information on it.
What you're looking at is an Aesir,
which is an elemental from the plane of fire.
They are smiths and crafters,
much like dwarves are,
but they are elementals,
not actual dwarves.
But they have very similar attributes
and very similar interests to dwarves.
Nice job.
All right.
Yeah.
Two more actions.
What are you going to do with them?
I'm going to step up onto the orc,
or whatever this is,
giant thing that fell down in front of me.
And I've got a few questions,
if you don't mind.
All right.
You wait for her to respond?
Yeah.
She will look at you,
run forward,
and say,
your questions,
I have no,
I have no,
I have nothing,
I have nothing to say to you.
I wish I had a better,
a better thing,
but I don't, so I'm just,
and then she,
and then she points her,
her fiery hammer at you,
at Hergen,
and a laser beam erupts from it
and hits both you and Hergen.
I need you both to make reflex saves.
Why didn't Jason kill her?
Because Jason was trying to talk to her.
Oh, good job, Hergen.
Good job, Hergen.
I needed that.
Hey.
Oh, sick.
Wow.
Oh, gosh.
Okay.
Well, this,
this laser beam erupts from her hammer
and you guys both dodge out of the way
with no,
with no problem.
In the cockiest manner possible,
I just like tilt my head to the left
as the thing fires past me.
What was that?
Oh.
This is persistent cold damage.
Did it help?
Is that killer?
Amazing.
Is she even alive?
She hits.
Man.
Oh, my gosh.
Barely.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Just need a stiff breeze, Hergen.
Well, we can try to capture her.
It's up to you.
Should we tie her up?
Make her talk?
Or just move on?
So, just so you guys are aware,
this cold damage is going to happen
every single round.
He is dead.
Yep.
Which is why she's not willing to talk to you
just for the record.
That's fair.
She knows she's dead.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
That was good enough.
One hit, cold damage.
One hit.
Should be just one damage.
We'll get her.
No, it wasn't.
One damage, but it was close.
One second, guys.
So, they came from this mine to our right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
One of those doorways.
What is this big chain thing?
That's a good question.
Just the mining equipment that got broke.
Woo.
I lack permission.
All right.
Party stash.
So, you are able to defeat the ogres
and the elemental.
As you start piecing around,
in the, not piecing around, but...
I'm comparing the size of the ogres' feet
to the prints that we saw in the other parts of town.
I'm assuming that they match?
Some of them, yes.
They're about the same size.
There are others that are slightly larger
than that you're seeing.
These, specifically, ogres are not giants.
Even though they are the giant type.
Are they giant-trained?
The ogres, yeah.
They've got the giant trait.
They're not giants.
So, ogres still exist in the world where you are.
They're just brutes, enforcers, and followers.
So, typically, they're kind of left alone
and that kind of thing.
But these ones are being led by something else.
Right.
And, why the heck...
We're out of combat.
Rurik is going to do some ministrations
and patch people up,
take out his medicine kit.
I was going to say...
You're like, oh, he gave you quite the wallop.
Do some healing would be fantastic.
Rurik has healing?
Yeah.
Oh, he is a field medic.
I'm not entirely sure what that means.
It means that he has healing.
Oh, I forget.
Am I...
I am an expert.
Is it worth rolling expert?
DC 20, that's kind of high.
I'm only rolling a plus 8.
I think I've got medicine 2.
That's standard here.
All right.
Bam.
Try to treat her again.
Oh, dear.
That's not very good, eh?
I mean, we've got a couple of these things, right?
I'll spend one.
Reroll using a hero point.
It'll make a critical success, right?
Excellent.
Okay.
Then, we have the continual recovery.
So, they're only immune for 10 minutes.
So, I can just keep going.
And we will.
Because, you know,
I need my fellow warriors up to snuff.
All right.
Uh...
A treat.
Something that you guys,
as you're going through the bodies,
you do find a few things that are interesting
and some things that you might want to pick up.
So, there is treasure.
The treasure is in the chat.
It is quickly disappearing under the fold.
All this healing.
So, the items that you do find...
I need to apply that healing.
I need to click that button.
Yep.
Okay.
Thanks.
Wow.
All right.
We're both barely hurt now.
40 out of 46.
41 out of 46.
Yep.
All right.
Ours is treasure.
All right.
So, if you scroll up,
you found amongst the bodies
a smoking axe,
a killer's belt,
two healing potions of lesser quality,
one soothing tonic of lesser quality,
and one life shot.
Cool.
Neat.
That's funny.
Hey, let me shoot you.
I like that.
I don't have the ability to see the smoking axe.
I don't have permission.
I don't assume I'm going to want it, but...
No, you aren't,
but the person who is going to want it
should probably have permission for it as well.
Uh-huh.
So, I will configure ownership.
I have no...
Change it to observer,
and you guys should be able to see it now.
Let me know if you can.
Oh.
Yep.
I'm assuming I'm the one supposed to take that,
but am I wrong?
Well, considering that you've got one person
who shoots guns
and another person who doesn't use weapons at all...
That was all you, sir.
I think that's your...
You make me feel stupid.
I think that's your...
No, you're just being overly considerate, Scott.
It's not you being stupid.
You're overly considerate.
You're like,
this is really the best thing for me,
but somebody else wants it.
That's how I was interpreting it.
I would put...
That belt looks really good for you, Jason.
Okay.
I need to...
That's a soothing tonic.
Oh, that's cool.
Intimidation checks.
I don't know if it's worth it.
Wow.
Not that part, necessarily.
The other part.
The intimidation check,
read the actual ability.
That will give me a solid zero.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, but read the ability,
and that'll...
And then you'll see what Ramsey was talking about.
Okay.
Definitely.
So, do you need a...
Do you need a rundown
on what that belt does, Jason?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Does the belt...
Does Jason or...
There's one ruby in the belt?
No?
There's a ruby.
You can use this once a day.
The ruby will refresh daily.
Which is...
OK.
Yeah.
You pull the ruby out of the belt
after you've attacked somebody.
You crush it,
and the dust from the ruby
will create
a 1D6 persistent bleed damage
on that person.
So...
And I need to
wear it,
or belt?
Yeah.
You would have to...
You would have to wear it.
And the reason
why it's especially good for you
is it requires an open hand to use
it. Right. From which, you know,
I mean, you usually have open
hands. Your other compatriots
don't, so.
I think one of you guys
ought to take a healing potion
and I'll snag the other one
in my consume. So I have one
of them. I took the soothing tonic
because it's kind of a lesser bit of healing
and I kind of sit in the
back. Sure, you guys grab the actual healing
ones. So I'll take one of the healing potions
and then they're kind of distributed
among us. So if we need it, we can
work with each other and I guess
you could drink it yourself. I didn't really think of that
but
excuse me. All right. I think
just to make sure, we will
go ahead and try to top you guys off.
We'll take another few minutes. We're already
kind of using a bunch of time
here. All right. One for Hergen.
Yep, that'll do. That will do.
Holy cow.
One for Demlore.
Maybe one
for Demlore. There we go.
Oh, well, not a lot.
I'm only four down at that point,
I think. Close enough. Yeah.
Well, it's been an hour healing.
Six rolls.
Okay. So you basically take that
hour to patch up
your bandages and that kind of stuff.
You do look
into the mines.
They definitely
seem pretty unstable.
These ogres definitely weren't
watching their heads as they were
walking around in the mines. So the
a bunch of the support beams appear
to be heavily
damaged and or destroyed.
You do think of
what they were
talking about as they were leaving
the mine,
that there was something that they
were looking for that was
in the mines, but they weren't able to
find it. And based
off of how one of
the ogres assumed that Demlore
was what they were looking for,
you would assume,
that it was a dwarf of some kind.
Which door did they come out of?
The center one.
The center one.
While we're
farting around,
I would shimmy up these rocks
here and then shimmy up
this here and just
take a good look around
and see from the elevated platform
if there's anything noteworthy.
I guess
movement in the town, friendly or
foe, signs of life.
Whatever I can.
I can perch.
That sounds like a perception
roll to me.
Do we have...
Can I just roll the blue eyeball?
Yes.
That's the one to roll.
So you look in the distance
and you see
in the far distance
to the west
near the cliffs,
you see the evidence of
smoke, but not like destructive
smoke, like heavy,
black smoke.
It's more like...
Right, but you see
evidence of camp
fires and things
in the distance, far to the west.
Do I have a gauge of like, hey, this would take about a day
to get there, or is this like a couple hours?
It's hard to tell.
Roll a
survival.
Do I have a
wounded, dying hero point?
Roll the skills,
find survival.
Just raw survival, then?
Yes.
Yeah, I'm going to get nothing on that.
You don't know how far...
Smoke is a tricky thing. It's really hard to tell
how far away it is.
It could be
like an hour that direction, or it could be
three or four days, you're not sure.
While I'm kind of up here, I'm going to take the shortcut
to the mines.
While he's doing that, Rurik and
Hergen, do you guys have anything that you would like
to do at this point?
I guess while he was doing that, someone mentioned this chain.
I'm just going to check it out, like, what the...
What do they use?
What's this for? It looks like it's
big enough the ogres brought it and used it for
something. Or, I don't know. I'm just checking it out.
Right. So you...
What is...
Roll a society.
Society.
Society.
Recall, can knowledge. Bam.
Right. So
you know that large chains
like this are often used as part of
dwarven mining procedures?
You're not exactly sure what for.
You just know that
a lot of dwarven mines have larger
chains. Maybe it's a pulley
system or something they use, but
not completely out
of the realm of... Not completely
abnormal.
Gotcha. Okay.
Alright. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. I think I would
be...
I'll pull you guys back into the...
I'd be searching around. I saw lots of bones.
Saw pickaxes. So I'd be searching footprints.
Travel.
Signs for, like, you know,
what happened to the dwarves if they were in a hurry.
Or not. Okay.
I don't know what this thorough search does.
That's what I was kind of reading. Okay.
You could do that, or you could do
a survival
tracking, if that's
something that you're wanting to go for.
Yeah. I kind of just know what happened to dwarves.
That's what I'm trying to do.
And I'm sorry, you said what to use besides the
thorough search? Track. Under survival.
So survival. Roll a survival.
Okay.
So you see very
similar signs in the mines.
This is what you saw in the town, right?
So there are some dead dwarves in the area.
A lot of them look like they were
squeezed, like, you know,
toothpaste in a
in a
squeezed out of their armor and that kind of thing.
There are some...
There's more evidence of, like, burning
and, you know, elemental damage in this
area as well. You do see
the ogre footprints.
And they appear to have...
Well, I mean, in this
in this mine,
they're all over the place, but there's a general direction
of the west. You see the
footprints coming from the west.
This appears to be a place
that a last stand was made by
the dwarves. So it has a lot
more heavy signs of battle.
And again, you notice
the mine
had some...
The ogres were not
the size that they should have been to be in that mine.
So there's a lot of, like, support beams,
structures, and things that are broken.
You do see a
more recent set
of footprints that are not ogre-sized
and don't appear
to be with any of the ogres
that does head into that center
mine.
But
that's pretty much all that you're able to
tell. So the ogres appear to
have come from the west.
They attacked the village
and then they attacked the mine.
And then after the battle was complete
and everything, there was
a set of dwarven footprints.
That went into the mine. And then you also
see the footprints of the
ogres and the azer that
you just fought.
That went in there as well. You don't see
the dwarven footprints that went
into the mine come back out.
Yep, yep, yep. So they're probably looking for the
dude in there. Everything in that middle
door, though. Thus far,
yes. On the middle door.
Well, that was very helpful. Right.
So what are you guys going to do? I was hoping to get down
in the mine. Yep, yep. I was going to say,
I should check out that mine, eh?
There's a survivor down there, it looks like.
Alright, so you guys head on into the mine.
There are a couple things that you
There are a couple things that you notice
as you're going in.
You do need to proceed very carefully.
You can't really bump into much of anything
otherwise, like, the mine
is prepped and ready to collapse.
So you must proceed
very carefully in order to be able to go in there.
Let's see here.
You are able to follow
the dwarven footprints.
With your roll,
Hergen, you're able to get
or are able to navigate through that mine
fairly well, even though you've never
been in there before.
Just because you're able to kind of, like, follow
the footprints. It became very
clear once you got, like, you know,
30, 40 feet in
that the dwarf
that was there pretty much did
a maneuver to cover his
tracks and went down
a left
junction when the
ogres and the azer went down a
right junction.
Basically, it looked like he kind of
walked it down the right junction,
then kind of swept up his
return tracks as he went back,
and then went down the left junction.
So you head down that direction.
As a dwarf,
you guys all have dark vision,
so you are able to see
in the mine perfectly at this point.
Everything is in monochromatic colors,
so everything looks black and white,
but you're able to see every crack, every crest.
You have a sense of
a lot of people that are
not really having any problems.
As you guys are going deeper into the mine,
I would like everybody to
make some perception
checks.
While this is being done,
this would be part of
the archetype feat here, the investigator
dedication.
Can I have a...
Oh, do you want to make finding the dwarf
one of your...
The case of the missing dwarf, right? Yeah, absolutely
So, yeah, what you need to do is on your character
There is a checkbox that is marked as pursue a lead investigation bonus
Click the pursue a lead. Yeah, so in your actions like that same little like sword thing at the top. There should be a
Okay. I see pursue lead. Yep. Check it suing a lead and now
roll
pull an investigation
For that again, I think it grants a bonus to perception to doesn't it and I'm sure I'm looking
the case
lead, all right, so you get
Investigation bonus plus one circumstance bonus to checks and they apply depend on the actions that you use to investigate to in GM checks
Investigate are typically perception checks or skill checks. Yep
Yeah, so go ahead and roll roll your perception check with that checkbox
Marked and you're gonna get a bonus
Is that trying to find that work?
Alright, so I checked the box then I'm gonna go down here to a perception regular perception check and go ahead and roll that
All right, I'm
Needing to refresh this page. I think because I'm missing all kinds of everything
I had a rush to when we got kicked back to it. Yeah
Sorry, I had my kids were going psycho. So I had to figure out what was going on. Yeah, no, no worries. No worries
Yeah, and eventually they'll get this fixed. It's like this is part of the version 13
transition thing so
Apparently, they're not handling switching between scenes, like, or switching back between scenes too well, so I'm hoping they'll get fixed, but on the bright side, the way to fix it, or the easiest way to fix it is just refresh the screen, so you should be okay.
Yeah, that seems to be working.
All right, so, Jason, there are a few times where, well, actually, let's start with Hergen.
Hergen, you are able, there are, as you're walking down there and you're kind of tracking the tracks, you notice a couple of crude traps that were put together that were designed for bigger creatures than yourself, and you are able to either choose to set them off, you're able to choose to either set them off for yourself without hurting yourself, or you can choose to bypass them and point them out to your friends.
These are things like pit traps, not.
Not really, like I said, not really heavily kind of rush jobs.
Why would we set them off?
Why not just bypass them and point them out?
Because there might be somebody else that comes along and doesn't see it and falls in and hurts themselves.
But either way, like I said, not a big deal.
I'm giving you the options of what you can do, not telling you what you should do.
So if you don't want to set off the traps, then you don't set off the traps.
There's not a wrong answer there.
Let's keep them alive for a minute.
Okay.
All right.
So you get past them, keep moving forward.
Rurik, you do notice that there are some definite sight lines that have been set up along this same corridor.
It looks like somebody was basically, how do I say it?
It's like things were set up in a way for a long-ranged attack to be able to be sent your direction.
Almost like, you know, kind of like a one-two process.
So, like, if something fell in the pit trap and they got beyond that, then, you know, somebody would be ready to, like, fire in and basically, like, cause chaos and destruction there.
So you kind of feel like you're in a, like, as you're walking around, you're like, I'm in a kill zone right now.
So as you guys proceed forward, Demler, you see a cave-in.
And as you're looking at that, you see a cave-in.
And as you're looking at that cave-in, you see a hand on the outside, like, sticking out of the rubble.
It's a dwarven-sized hand.
He's going to run over quickly, get there, and see if he can't start pulling some stones and stuff out of the way.
Yeah.
Hoping that it's not a cave-in.
So you start.
Okay.
So Hergen and Rurik, you see Demler suddenly run forward to a pile of stones.
And after a few moments, you see that he's excavating a dwarf.
What do you do?
The hell?
The hand, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Fair enough.
All right.
So you guys run in, and after a few minutes, you are definitely able to pull this dwarf out of the rubble.
Both Demler and Hergen, you both recognize him.
He's a member of your clan.
That was sent out as part of this colony as the captain of the defenses for the Dagger Sheath.
He goes by the name of Captain Hale Ironmark.
And everybody go ahead and roll a reflex save for me.
I don't like it.
I know, right?
I got a pretty good reflex, though.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I don't think that many people here are going to have a reason to be too concerned about that.
I think that's some pretty reasonable people.
Dexterous dwarves.
A little unusual.
Yeah, yeah.
What the fuck?
Yeah.
All right.
All right.
Y'all do just great.
Yeah.
Okay.
So you are able to pull him out from the rubble.
But as you do, even more of the rubble just kind of starts backfilling in.
And you...
You start seeing the ground or the corridor in front of you just starts collapsing.
You're able to get out of the way, but you got to get out of here as soon as possible.
Yeah.
All right.
You have a regular...
Not...
Not...
He struggles to get to his feet, but it's very clear that he has, at best, a sprained ankle.
At worst, something's broken.
Something far worse.
All right.
Cool.
Well, if you take one side, I'll take the other, and we'll start walking.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's go.
I'm pretty strong.
Remember where the traps are.
Let's do it.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All the way to go.
So you guys start heading out.
And as you start walking towards the entrance, the rumbles and grumbles of this cave-in start
getting louder and louder.
You find yourself moving at...
A brisker pace and a brisker pace to the point where you are starting to go to an all-out run.
You make it to where the traps are, and in order to be able to get around the traps,
you have to slow down to get around, or you can attempt to try and run over them and hope
that they don't trigger, or you can attempt to jump, or you can come up with some other
idea of what you're going to do to get beyond these paces.
But otherwise, you would basically have to stop and kind of edge your way around the
side of the tunnel in order to be able to get past them.
So they cover up a majority of the corridor.
If it was just us running around, I wouldn't think that's a big deal, but kind of escort
a less-than-mobile person.
With a cave-in right behind you.
Right.
I mean, this is basically like you are charging down this...
At this point, you're charging down the hallway, and you see it coming up.
So...
Yeah.
Think fast.
What are you going to do?
I think probably the fastest thing to do is set the trap, like, activate it, and then
move over it.
I mean, it's a trap.
It's going to go off pretty instantaneous.
They were, like, pit traps, though?
Or...
They were pit traps.
Yep.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
So, yeah, it would be falling into it.
Not a whole lot of go over it.
Right, right, right.
You could let the cave collapse in on the pit trap, and then just walk over top of
it.
Well, I think there's a bit of a sequencing problem there.
Right, yeah.
There you go.
All said.
Yep.
What's your problem?
I have, as we're running, knowing what these are specifically, I'm going to hand off
our compadre to Ergin and start rummaging through my backpack while we're jogging to pull out
my wrist crappler.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
And get that guy set, you know, set up on myself so we can make that happen.
So, I need to turn that into a held.
I'm assuming, right?
Right.
And one-handed.
So, I'll do a held one-handed.
So, then, yeah, you know, the idea is that as we're approaching that thing, I'm just
going to take aim, shoot that at something, you know, high on the wall or whatever that
will allow us to navigate around that or over that quickly.
Okay.
All right.
So, is there...
Excellent idea.
Wrist grappler for the win.
So, that's grappling gun held in one hand.
All right.
So, why don't you just make a...
Just go ahead and roll an agility test.
Acrobatics or athletics?
Agility per se.
Well, it doesn't really specify.
You know what?
It doesn't specify a skill.
So, I'm not going to make you roll a skill.
You use your wrist grappler and you shoot it out and you are able to get it to hook onto
something in the ceiling.
And at that point, you can do whatever it is that you want.
Do whatever it is that you want to do.
I'll grab our D little...
DLF.
That's what it is.
Right?
DLF.
I just finished that.
Did you?
I just finished Prince Gasgrain.
Prince Gasgrain.
Yes.
So, yeah.
All right.
So, you grab...
And just swing over the pit trap with him.
Okay.
Get him on the other side.
And then...
All right.
Do Hurgen or Rurik have any tricks up their sleeves that they wish to include in the
game?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Do you have any tips for the employee at this point?
I have that scout thing.
So the scout dedication, does that help?
It says something about capable of guiding your allies, detecting imminent threats, and
avoiding the attention of dangerous enemies.
So in this specific scenario, it's not going to be super helpful.
But at the very least, you can attempt to jump over the pit if you wanted to.
So that's, at the bare minimum, something you can do.
The pit itself is about 10 feet wide.
So it's pretty wide.
Okay.
But if you've got good enough athletics, you can definitely get over it.
So the choices are jump over it or go slowly around it?
Right, and potentially get overtaken by the caveman.
Depending, though, if you have something that allows you to move normally over difficult terrain,
then that would allow you to kind of scurry around the edge without having to slow down.
So I'm not sure if you have anything like that.
I try to use acrobatics to balance and scurry around the edge.
Because balance is an acrobatics action.
Yes, I will allow it.
Okay, sweet. We'll do that.
I can't think of anything else. I'm coming up with nothing.
Too good.
That's better.
Falling into a pit trap does not sound like a way to go.
So we used a hero point on that.
Yeah, so Rurik, you effectively tightrope walk along the edge.
Don't ask me how you do it, but you basically just kind of...
Whip around and get going.
I'm going to try it again.
Okay, so I went ahead and put an athletics check card in there.
If you just click on that, that should give you your athletics check.
Okay, I was on it. Ready for the roll.
Okay, so you leap over the pit trap and actually get about...
Yeah, you actually get about five feet beyond the pit trap with your jump and just keep running.
Nice.
So you guys get ready.
Get beyond that pit trap.
I would like everybody to roll an athletics just to see how you're holding up.
Athletics or if you can come up with a con-based skill that you think would be good.
I might re-roll with a hero point.
Yeah.
Wow.
I'm probably not doing well.
That was an awesome roll, apparently.
It's fine.
Yeah.
Okay.
Gosh.
A little winded.
Or a lot winded.
That's fine.
Okay, so Hergen basically looks like he's about to drop right underneath all the stone.
But from nowhere, he gets this second wind and just kind of starts outpacing everybody.
Grabs Captain Kale along the way and basically just like hoofs it out of the cave.
Both Emlor and Rurik, you guys are able to make it out of the cave, but each of you take three points of damage from the debris that basically just kind of is chasing at your heels.
So you don't quite make it out unscathed, but you each take about three points of damage getting pummeled by stones getting out of there.
And Hergen.
You are going to be getting a hero point for this hour.
Nice.
All right.
So you make it out of the mine just as like a billow of dust and debris just kind of mushrooms out of the mine.
And the cave-in is complete.
There's like one dude in there?
That you know of, yeah.
Okay.
Captain Kale says, you know, kind of limping.
Limping around, leaning on Hergen, says, thank you so much for saving me.
I was going to do my last stand with those ogres and the tunnel just started shaking and I got buried underneath that rock pile and I couldn't move.
So thank you.
That could have been my last winter.
Where's the army?
Definitely not looking good.
Well.
Well, you tell them.
I'm going to see that leg.
I'm going to start treating Woot up as God.
We're in.
Yeah.
We're in the army.
Whatever was up here is dead.
I don't think there's anything alive in the city.
Not that I've seen.
I would ask him, did they send a message to the king to send the army?
Because we were not aware of any such message.
No.
I just assumed if there were dwarves here that there would be an army behind.
It's we've been we've been captured for the past month, I would have assumed that the king that king that the king would have sent somebody for sure that somebody is the king.
But I don't think things go smoothly at home either.
So for all that was sent.
Well, we need to we need to warn the king.
There's there's trouble afoot.
They've captured they've captured a number of the a number of the citizens of Daggersheath.
I was only able to escape.
Just a few days ago, and they spent and they spent all kind they spared no expense in trying to track me.
They did not.
They do not want word of the attack to make it to the king.
Can we ask who they is?
You can.
It's a very good question.
What do you know?
What do you know about these guys?
Oh, Captain Captain Kale looks at you and he says, depends how much do you believe in fairy tales?
We believe in giants.
Well, you just took down a couple of ogres.
And oh, I wouldn't really call it a dwarf, but something of fire that looks rather dwarfish or shaped.
Yes.
Well, you did say giants, so he must at least believe in a little bit of the fantastical.
They have been extinct for over a thousand years, but somehow the village was attacked by giants and giants.
So these ogres, the ogres helped, but the giants were the real threat.
Um, we fought stone giants, fire giants, giants.
They, oh my gosh, there are, they do not, at least the stories say giant tribes stick to themselves and they do not band together or anything, but that was not what I experienced those.
They did not kill, they captured and I've seen a number of cruel things done to our people, um, dealing with infusing them with elements.
From the elemental planes to turn them into something different, that Acer was not a dwarf, but there are dwarves like that, that the giants made.
And once they've been converted, they've truly been converted.
They do not have their mind.
They're mindless elemental zombies that do.
Um, zombie is not the right word.
They will do the bidding of whatever, um, their masters tell them.
They still have their wits.
So, like I said, it was not a, it was not a zombie, but it's almost as if they were brainwashed.
Into being the, being thralls of the giants or the giants, the bosses, or somebody behind them.
I don't, I do not know as far as I can tell, it was the giants who are, who are making the orders as possible.
There could be something greater, but the stories say that the giants were, um, singular.
They neither joined, they joined, they joined to no sides and only supported other, um, other evil races and organizations that would.
Help them reach their own ends.
I don't see a giant bending the knee to anyone, but Erebos.
And with that, he makes some sort of, um, religious religious symbol as if he, you know, as if he was Catholic and said the devil's name.
Oh, all right.
Well, if you wish to know there, there, there are survivors, they're about, uh, they're, they're in the, they're in the camp, um, about a half a day's March to the west.
Oh, good.
Good.
I saw the camp.
But I must, I thought it might be like six days block from how many?
Survivors or enemy?
Yeah, survivors.
We have, we, our numbers have dwindled.
Um, we are down to, um, 15, 20 of us are left or at least that's the way it was a few days ago.
Were you guys able to bring any of the giants down?
We were not prepared.
So no, um, the ogres we, we have dealt with in the past, but the giants are a completely different, completely different beast.
They, uh, they're more powerful than, um, than what our small colony was, was prepared for.
Um, we wounded many, but none fell, but we must tell the king.
Yeah.
Do you know which way they went?
Um, which way the giants, sorry.
Um, no, no.
Um, I, I don't think that the, I don't think that any of them are left in the village, uh, or in the village in the, in the camp.
Uh, when, when I, that was the only way that that's the only reason.
I was able to escape.
Um, the guard lap, the, the guard, um, lapsed and ogres are not clever beasts.
Um, so I was able to escape with the help of my companions to try to make it, try to make a run for, uh, for iron hold, but I didn't make it.
Speaking of iron holds, I agree.
We need to get back.
It'll take a day out of our journey to get the other survivors, but I think we have to do that too.
Who's got the other, uh, I think I've got one half.
Of the magic scroll.
Oh, we did get sending stones or the scroll.
That's right.
Okay.
That's helpful and good.
Archment of direct message.
So.
Yeah.
Who was it on the other end that had that?
Uh, that would be, I have everything prepared, but that name.
I'm sorry.
I can't see the NPCs list is blank to me.
Oh, um, let me, let me fix that.
Did you Jason, were you talking about the parchment of direct message?
Right.
All right.
You guys should have access to it now.
Um, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It was Mayla black shard.
Okay.
Yeah.
Just shit.
She was, yeah, she's the, uh, court whisperer, the spine master of, of the, um, you did, um, or at least from what, what I remember, you guys got some unsavory vibes from her.
Um, or at least that seemed to be the way that you were reacting to her.
So, okay.
Well, I think regardless, we, uh, probably should, should try it enough to message.
I can't imagine as unsavory as any of those folks are that any of them want giants be down the door of iron hold.
Yeah, probably not.
We traveled, uh, several days to get here.
The range on that is, uh, it looks like 10 miles.
Yep.
So we need to go back a couple of days, like 10 miles through the mountains could be a decent day's walk.
Um, so, well, you did also.
You did also, you did also have mounts on this.
You had mountain goats, so that's why it took so little, but how far away are we, um, by goat, uh, from iron hold, um, you are about, um, it was two weeks, 14 days.
That's three weeks of walking, right?
The goats still, uh, in decent shape.
Yeah, they're, they're, I mean, you guys took pretty decent care of them, right?
So, and they're, and they're well, and they're well-trained steeds.
So, I mean, they didn't give you just like Joe Schmoe's goat, you know, they, they were, they were castle goats.
Excellent.
Hopefully they don't.
They didn't run off in a commotion.
All right.
Right.
Um, well, is the priority to get the, uh, survivors on lockdown or do we send the message?
Well, we can't save the people without the army.
Don't have enough goats to take them all with us.
Can't let a few dwarves risk this quest.
Well, at the very least, um, at the very least, uh, and this is just Chris, but very least you could go and check out the camp, see what, see what, see what's going on there before you make a decision about whether or not you need a
full army to, uh, rescue 15 to 20 dwarves.
But then again, time is of the essence.
So, right.
So you thought they were a half a day away.
Yeah, that, that's what Kayle, that's what Kayle said faster by go.
Um, yeah.
Um, I just applied the damage that you, we, we took, oh, oh, oh, it's like all of a sudden anyway.
Um, yeah, it's probably worth a couple hour ride.
Uh, we can get there by night.
So I would think, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Um, as you, once you've decided to move towards, um, towards helping the, um, freeing the rest of the, um, settlers of dagger sheath, um, Kayle gives you his, um, a map that he's been holding on to for the area.
Um, it's the survey map Atlas, um, which will give you a plus one item bonus to survival checks and any skill checks.
Do you recall?
Knowledge for a specific area, which happens to be the area of dagger sheath.
So, all right.
I think, uh, Perkin would be best to take that.
Lead the way.
Probably both lead the way and take the survey map.
Yeah.
Um, the, uh, investigation is closed.
Oh, for having found the, uh, having found the dwarf.
Yes.
Yeah.
Okay.
Um, would it, are you, do you wish to start another investigation?
Um, I don't like, yeah.
It's, but I don't know that I have a clear sense of what I would be investigating at this point.
That isn't, I mean, a major theme.
Well, yeah, but I, I think that like investigating the, like investigating the camp of the camp of ogres to figure out, to learn more about the giant, about the giant invasion or something like that, that could totally count.
All right.
I agree with you, Sam.
Yeah.
Perfect.
All right.
Cool.
All right.
So you guys, um, so, um, Kayle gives you what information he can.
Um, but as he's really not in any, in, in much, uh, shape to be able to be of use for you guys, um, he, he's at this point, he would pretty much, um, keep you like be, be a burden.
Um, he says that he'll find, um, he'll find a location.
He marks it on the map.
He's like, this is a safe space, uh, a safe area.
I'm going to go in Lilo for, for a while.
Um, when you have, um, when, when.
You return, please come and pick me up.
Okay.
All right.
You guys head down to, uh, head down to the ogre camp.
So you make it, you make it a few hours by goat.
Um, make it, make it close to where the ogre camp is.
Um, you, uh, as you, you approach, um, I'm assuming that you're going to want to stealth your way in.
Stealth it.
Stealth seem to be our MO.
Mm-hmm.
So you are able to.
You said that I just, I'm so good at it.
You're still decent.
Um, so you get to, you get to a place where you're able to kind of get an overlook on the, uh, on the camp.
The camp is, um, on the edge of a cliff.
There are, there are a number of smaller, um, tents that are more like a, that are more like, you know, living quarters.
Um, in the eastern section of the camp, there's roughly seven of those.
Um, each, the, the camp itself has a number of, um, trebuchets.
Um, and some log, and some log walls that are surrounding a larger big camp, uh, big tent.
Um, and along the, and along the log wall, um, there are a number of cages.
And inside those cages, you see dwarves.
Um, and at that point, let's go ahead and roll some stealth rolls, uh, before I start, before I start giving any additional information.
Yes, yes, yes.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Can we be done by 10?
Can we be done by 10?
Around 10?
Yes.
Or, uh, 1030?
Boop.
All right.
Is stealth, stealth gonna be, uh, just, okay, just, you want sneak stealth or just stealth?
Sneak works, um, yeah.
Doesn't matter.
As far as I know, it doesn't matter, but sneaking is fun.
Awesome.
Um, okay.
So, you guys are definitely able to get pretty close to the camp before you are, before, you guys are able to get close to the camp.
Um, nobody, nobody discovers you.
Um, so, there's some additional things that, that you notice in this camp.
One, um, there are a lot of ogres, but they're not all indensed in one space.
Like, they're spread out throughout the camp.
Um, so, it's not like, it's not a situation where you're basically looking at, like, you know, you walk in, if you decided you wanted to do something that you, that you would immediately start battling with the entire camp.
So, if you play it smart, you think that you might be able to...
Get by without having too much, um, you might be able to get by without having too many, uh, too many, uh, run-ins with anything.
You do notice that the large tent itself is, um, does appear to be guarded.
Um, so, you would assume that somebody of import is in that tent.
And you do also notice that there is quite a few, um, that there are quite a few, um, elementals as well.
So, you've got the ogres.
From which you're, from which you're, look, you're prepared for.
Um, but you also see some more azers, um, walking around.
As well as a few, um, a few of those lava rats that you were looking at.
Um, and you also see some mudmen and, and dogs that are made out of mud as well.
Oh.
Um, again, nothing is, like, fully condensed.
They're kind of, like, out and dispersed.
Um, dispersed around.
Um, but that's the general, the general vibe.
Of the, um, of the war camp.
And I'm going to go ahead and activate a window, uh, or, uh, um, you guys, like, you know.
So, you'll be able to kind of see the general layout of the camp.
Um, the direction that you come from is in the north.
Um, but there is a way to approach the camp from the southeast as well.
So, you could come back around from that direction, too, if you wanted.
Gotcha.
All right.
And to hit our 10 o'clock deadline.
Um, that was, uh, this, this seems like a good place to call it for tonight.
Yeah.
Um, so everybody.
Yeah.
So, you, you think that there's some important people that are in that tent.
Um, because it's larger than the others.
And it does have two guards in the, uh, in the entrance of the tent.
But as these are tents, like, you can, I mean, it's not like you need to go directly through the entrance if you're wanting to.
Right.
Gather more information.
Okay.
Um.
I think where the dwarves are, um, the dwarves are over here in this direction.
Um, like, kind of, um, they're on the other side of the, on the other side of the wall a little bit.
Um, so, they're kind of tucked away in an area where it'd be pretty difficult for them to escape without, like, going through the entire camp.
So, as you kind of look at where they're being held, a new appreciation for Captain Kale, um, comes to mind as you realize just exactly how much he had to navigate.
Um, so, as you kind of look at where they're being held, a new appreciation for Captain Kale, um, comes to mind just exactly how much he had to navigate.
Um, so, as you kind of look at where they're being held, a new appreciation for Captain Kale, um, comes to mind just exactly how much he had to navigate.
In order to be able to get to the point where he was, where he was able to escape.
And, um, I'm going to grant some XP as well for the session.
Um, everybody gets 500 XP.
Level four.
Which for those of you, yes, which for those of you keeping track at home means you are, um, you are now level four.
Ah, yay.
All right.
All right, level up in two minutes.
Snack.
Snack.
Snack.
Snack.
Snack.
Snack.
It's going to be a lot quicker than what it is with the Crown of the Immortals, because this one doesn't have, I don't have nearly as many, like, here's these other things that you need to take, that you need to worry about.
So I'm actually starting to think that maybe I should scale some of that stuff back into the Crown of the Immortals anyway, just because it's like the whole, like, skill feat thing where everybody gets an extra skill feat.
I'm like, nobody really uses their skill feats, so why am I giving them extra ones?
I was kind of playing with mine.
Yeah, hopping around on the...
This is fun. Fun night.
Yeah.
All right, so next time we meet, you guys are going to have to, or, I mean, you can either turn around and leave, or you can try and figure out how to infiltrate the camp and discover what you can, save some dwarves, make it home.
Yep.
Guns a-blazin'.
Or stealth.
Right, or stealth, or both.
Maybe a little from column A, a little from column B.
