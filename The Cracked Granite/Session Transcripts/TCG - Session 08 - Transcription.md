# Session Transcript
All right, so we start today with you guys getting within sight of Ironhold.
You haven't necessarily run into any scouts or any advanced troops yet,
but you do see Ironhold in the distance.
And there appears to be a lot of activity.
How are you going to approach?
I think at this point we're probably not sneaking much, much more in.
What do you all think?
I think you're probably right.
We were making haste to get there, you know, I think about a day earlier than they thought we could be, would be.
So I think our element of surprise is the fact that we're here already.
So if we can quickly get audience with the king, we can achieve the mission.
All right, so you're moving in brazenly, boldly, that kind of thing.
I should be welcomed in there if the king's still in power.
Yeah, that's true.
I will take silence as a set, unless somebody is thinking.
Okay.
All right.
So you guys head on in.
As you get closer to the gates, you do hear some voices from the ramparts yelling out to you.
There's, as you get closer and closer to the gates, there's, the gates themselves just kind of open up as you get within like 50 yards.
Um, they start opening, um, and as you approach, uh, there are a couple of guards that approach you and say, um, say, Dimla, Rurik, Hergen, we weren't expecting you.
How goes the war at the front?
And, uh, smirk a little bit.
Right.
Uh, we...
Well enough.
We need to speak with the king immediately.
We have urgent news.
Very good.
Um, they, one of them runs, runs to a messenger, and the messenger, like, high tails it.
Um, they, they, of course, invite you into Ironhold.
You are welcome to be there.
Um, do you...
What do you, uh, what do you do while you're waiting for the messenger to return?
Uh...
I would think start moving in the direction of the king's chambers.
Yeah, I wasn't so much planning on waiting.
Yeah, neither was I.
Okay.
That was absolutely necessary.
Well, things might be a little bit difficult, because certain parts of the city are kind of, um, are kind of off-limits, which require bureaucratic sort of approval and that kind of stuff in order for you to be able to get there.
However, you would be able to make it to, um, at least to the, um, the residence of the king or the seat of power.
Um, you'd be able to make it to the, you know, outer buildings of either of those places.
Um...
Which of the two would you like to move towards?
Um, I mean...
Because they are not the same place, so...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh, what time of day is it?
Can we ask this guy that's at the gate what's been going on here while we've been gone?
Um, it's not a bad idea.
Okay.
Um, yeah, the guy at the gate is, like...
Well, word came out of the ogre attack, so we are, uh...
So we're mustering the army to head south to dwell this ogre rebellion and avenge our comrades.
Um, the, uh, the army is nearly, is nearly completely mustered.
Um, we at least have the, we at least have enough to be able to send our advanced force, um, by the end of the day.
So, um...
Perfect.
We should be able to, we should be able to make there.
Go ahead.
What was the king's announcement?
Well, the king announced that, uh, the, um...
That there was an ogre incursion at the, uh, at the settlement of the dagger sheath, and that, uh, and that you, um, you three were, um, locked, or were stuck in the, um, in the ruins of, um...
That dagger sheath, the, uh, dagger sheath, the, um, the sentinel's rise, uh, power, where, um, there seemed to be a, um, a troll attack.
So, clearly, the trolls and ogres are working together, and we are expecting to, um, and we're expecting to go and, um, squash them.
Like we squashed, uh, you know, like we squashed so many other enemies.
It's surprising that the ogres have dared defy us.
Usually, they, they've been, they've been tribute, uh, they've been tribute, um, payers for a very long time.
Yeah, I was trying to get an idea of, you know, what was going on in their scenario, if they even, you know, who's the orders coming from, and things like that, so...
Sure. Uh, yeah, so, uh, basically, it was by royal decree.
So, um...
It's pretty much, it, it, from, from what you would know, as far as, like, where the orders come from,
Um, it's by royal decree, which basically means it's either King Hargrin, or somebody who has access to King Hargrin's seal.
So, it's the Deep Mantle seal, um, that, that basically signed those orders.
Um.
And it was sent by Cryer.
Yes, yeah.
Um, but, you know, it was, it also kind of came through the, from the military ranks, it came through the, came through the generals, and, and, um, and captains.
The hierarchy.
Right.
So, yeah, so, that's, that's the general idea, um, and, I mean, you don't, you, like, this isn't one of those things where it's a carousing sort of thing, or anything like that.
If you, if there's information that you want to know specifically, then you can just ask it, and, and these guys are more than happy to give you whatever information they have, um, for that.
So, if there's anything else that you specifically want to ask about, um, that, that, if, if they know it, they will let you know.
So.
I'm curious about the king's personal guard.
Um.
You know, do we know where they are?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
So, Bramley Stone, stone guard, the captain of the, um, of the king's guard, has been, um, ever since the announcement went out, he has not left the king's side.
Um, and he has at least a detail of, um, at least a detail of three or four, um, of his, of his own, uh, of his top choice of the king's guard that are by the king 24-7.
Um, and then, you know, the, you know, the other members of the guard are, you know, further out and that kind of thing.
Um, they've got it set up so he's under 24-hour surveillance and 24-hour watch, um, as is customary to do during times of war.
Mm-hmm.
All right.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Um, to answer your question.
Well, yeah.
To answer your question earlier, Ramsey, like, you guys actually arrived, like, it's not quite the break of dawn, but it's in the early morning.
Um, because you pushed yourselves, you pushed your mounts to be able to get there as soon as possible.
You were able to, uh, pretty much instead of, instead of arriving at the end of this day, you're arriving at the beginning of this day.
Um, so you, you, you basically gained a full, a full day, full day's travel.
Um, and the options, uh, Scott, uh, to, to, to answer your question, um, are the king is most likely to be either in his personal, um, his personal residence or his seat of power.
Um, so, um, this isn't, he, he actually has two separate areas.
He's got his ancestral home, which is where he lives.
Um, and then his seat, then the castle, fortress, seat of power, um, which is where he reigns from.
Um, they, they are connected, but they are not, um, but they're not, like, right next to each other.
So, there's some, some sort of secret tunnel system that keeps them, you know, separated.
Um.
Um, yeah, I think generally, uh, just need to be moving in that direction.
Um, the runner is probably out ahead of us by a ways, but, um, we can at least move that direction.
I don't know how long it would take to walk through the, I don't know.
What do you want to call it?
Yeah, the city.
The city, but, yeah.
Yeah, so, the, the king's, the king's residence and the seat of power is pretty deep into the city.
It's not, like, next to the, next to the gates.
So, um, it's a, it's a pretty substantial walk, but, um, this also isn't, like, the, um, it's also not, like, New York City in scale.
Um, this is definitely a larger, uh, a larger city, but there are a number of different things that you have access to, um, that allow you to be able to move pretty, um, pretty quickly through the city if you need to.
There are teleportation circles and teleportation rings, um, as, kind of, like, a public transport system, um, as well as, well, and these, these are, like, Stargates, right?
So, you dial in, and they're, like, connected Stargates.
Yeah.
So, dial in the, the location, and then you walk through it, and you pop out the other, the other side of it.
Um, but, um, but, I, so, it's, it's a good way of being able to move around the city, but it's not necessarily, like, something that's, um, like, I, I didn't want to give the impression that it's, like, teleportation circle, you can go halfway across the world.
It's, like, these are very localized magical devices, um, in, in the world of Etheria, um, the Dwarven, uh, it's kind of, like, a little bit of a different thing.
The Dwarven community is actually the keepers of, of knowledge and magic, um, rather than the Elves, and the Elves are more, um, psionic in nature, so they have, like, innate abilities that they do,
but it's not, um, but it's not, like, magic magic, so it's not something that they can, it's, they're more, I guess, more Tolkien-esque, where, like, Elves are, Elves don't really, they've just got special abilities, they don't, like, do magical circles, like, they don't have, like, magical runes and build magical things, they're just, they innately are able to do things, um,
and that kind of thing? Does that make sense?
Mm-hmm.
Like, like, when...
I like it, yeah.
Yeah, yeah. So, that, that's the distinction, is, like, the Dwarves are actually the keepers of knowledge and the keepers of magic, um, which is different than most fantasy worlds, because usually it's the Elves.
But in this world, like, psionics, um, it, while psionics don't necessarily, um, aren't necessarily exclusive to Elves, they have a tendency to be more, um, more innate, um, among Elves.
So, it's just a little bit of an oddity there. So, the Dwarven, so, all that being said, I'm sorry, that was a little bit of a lord of, all that being said, like, the Dwarven, the Dwarven city has a bunch of, like, magical means of communicating and, and, um, inner, and being able to move, and being able to move and transition and things by, by magical means.
Um, so, in order to be able to get to the king's residence, um, it'll probably take you about 20-30 minutes going, going through the, going through the gates and things that would require you to get there, um, primarily because not everything is 100% interconnected and the king's area, and, and the area that the king lives is under a lot more scrutiny and a lot more security.
So, there's not a direct route. You can't just walk up to a teleportation ring and say, drop me at the king's residence. You know, you gotta, kind of, right, do some stuff. So, uh, but yeah, you are, you are able to get there within about 20 minutes by, um, teleportation and, um, also there's some sort of magical monorail that, that, that, uh, flies around the city as well.
Wow. So, um, so, so, it's kind of like New York, but not like New York.
Yeah, but not New York. All right. Yeah, I think, you know, we just kind of start heading that general direction anyway.
All right.
And then if we, uh, get to a good spot, then, I don't know, maybe it's time to take a nap while we wait for, you know, at the door or something. I don't know.
All right. Um, so, let's see. As you guys, as you guys start heading out, um, the, uh, the, the gate, uh, the gate, uh, the gate card, um, calls out and says, where should we say that you are?
Seat of, seat of power.
Seat of power.
Yeah.
Nah.
Okay.
I was thinking seat of power. I don't know why we'd go to his residence, but yeah.
Yeah. If it's, if it's the day, then he's probably left the residence, I would imagine.
No.
Well, yeah, it's, it's a crapshoot. Um, but yeah, if, you know, cause it's, because it, it is the day, but it's also the early morning.
So it just kind of depends, but, uh, well, the conversation we want to have is more of a seat of power conversation versus, that's true.
Fair enough.
A brunch, a brunch conversation.
Fair enough.
Right.
That makes sense to me.
All right, so you head, you head into the, uh, to the king's castle, um, to await an audience.
Um, so you get there about, again, takes about 20, 30 minutes.
Um, by the time you make it there, uh, you are able to, um, ascertain that the city itself is definitely under, um, is definitely busy.
And, um, busier than it usually is.
Um, so you've got, um, a couple of different things that are happening.
So, one, you've got the military that is mustering, and, um, people are, um, and, and people are, um, going out, getting their, getting, you know, you, you see a lot more army presence, like armored dwarves running around and that kind of thing.
Um, as well as kind of like the, uh, the tagalongs for the army, like, you know, the, um, the people that handle the food and the people that, you know, handle all the logistical stuff and, you know, the extra armaments and all that stuff.
Like, there are a number of different, like, shops and things that are closed, um, that are closed, but, like, are actually, like, you know, moving.
So, it's like there, there are certain shopkeepers that kind of travel with the army, and they're definitely, um, prepping their wares and their stores and their potions and magics and different things.
Um, you'll also see that there is, in the, in the town square, um, or the city square, um, you see that there is a, uh, a group of, um, a group of protesters that have also been mustering about, you know, the, you know, this is, this is the uplanders, this is the uplanders war.
Why are we, why are we, um, leaving the safety of the mountain, um, we should, we should just stay here, and, you know, that kind of thing.
So, just more along the lines of the, the people who feel like they shouldn't, that we shouldn't be moving, uh, shouldn't be moving forward.
There are a number of those people that are mustering in protest, um, although none of them do seem to be people of any import, um, which kind of tracks for,
um, these sort of political movements, like, the people who actually have the power don't actually show up at the meetings, um, sort of thing.
That's kind of what's happening here.
You have a bunch of commoners that are running around sticking their necks out for, for the cause, um,
Um, and you don't see anybody that, you know, really is, you know, really would be in charge of, of, of what, uh, of actually, uh, of the actual political movement.
Um, effectively college students, right?
You know, the, you know, the university students that are, that are protesting.
It's, uh, that sort of a situation.
Um, so, there's unrest in the city in a number of different areas.
There's unrest in the separatist faction, which is basically, uh, trying to make this as difficult of a thing as possible for the army to go.
Because they want to encourage those people who are already out there to come back to the mountain and to leave the surface dwellers to their own fate.
Um, and then you have the army that's mustering and the people that are supporting the army that are, um, that are working to go.
Um, you do get quite a few odd looks from a bunch of different people because technically you're supposed to be, you, you are one of the, are, you are three of the people that they're technically supposed to be saving right now.
And you are recognizable in the city.
So.
Yeah.
So there are a bunch of people.
Good.
Yeah.
So, and the separatists basically, when they pick it out, they're like, see, see, it's a conspiracy.
They're fine.
There's no problem.
They're making it up, you know?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, um, so you unwittingly cause a little bit more of a ruckus than intended, um, by your mere presence.
But, um, you know, that's the, that's the fate of being a hero.
You show them the blood on our war hammers and different things.
Yeah.
You're like, does this look fake to you?
Um.
Is this earth org?
It was a tough one.
Yep.
Um, so you guys had, you, you guys do make it to the, you guys do make it to the castle.
Um, when you're there, uh, you know, the, um, the, guard, um, the guard is there.
The, the, uh, royal guard is there.
Um, which is not indicative of the king being there.
The royal guard kind of hangs out in both of those locations all the time.
Um, but as you approach, uh, one of the, one of the guards, um, approaches you and says,
um, says, well met.
Uh.
Indeed, well met.
We weren't, we weren't expecting to see you.
What's, is the war over?
Nope.
No, no, far from it.
Uh, situation has changed.
About to begin.
We have urgent news for the king and the king's ears only.
Um, very good.
I will, uh, I will inform my superiors.
Um, he, um, basically goes and calls, calls a runner and asks them to go.
Um, while he, um, while he stays guard where he's at.
Um, you, uh, wait a few minutes.
Um, but as you do, um, after, after a few minutes, you see the first runner exiting the seat of,
the, the, exiting the, the, um, the castle, the keep, um, and the second runner, um, going to the captain of the guard.
Are they both, like, the, the, um, the gate runner, um, just gives a solid, gives a solemn nod to you as he walks by and he heads back to the front gate.
Um, after hearing a few, uh, minutes, um, from, um, um, after, you know, hearing what the other runner has to say to the, uh, to the guard.
Um, um, the guard gestures to a few other of the royal guard and have them, um, have, have them, uh, escort you in.
Um, um, however, in order to be able to gain presence with the king during war times, um, you are required to relinquish your weapons in order to be able to enter into his council.
As a cautionary thing, everybody is required to.
Seems reasonable.
You want to want to pull a Gandalf?
Well, I mean, technically, yeah, technically, Jason, I think you, you just don't have, like, you don't have weapons, so.
Whatever.
You don't care.
Yeah, I'm not sure I can pass my boomstick off as a walking stick, so.
Right.
Yeah.
And Hergen's, Hergen's smoking axe kind of, kind of gives the game away.
Yep.
It sure does.
Smoldering metal.
I could, I could maybe try to hide something, and I, in fact, have a level one magic item that lets me hide things, but, um, I don't think now is the time to try that.
If we're pointing out that someone else is a traitor and we get costume weapons in, I can go poorly, so I'm not going to bother.
All right.
Yeah, I mean, um, I got my striking clan dagger, you know, if they want it, they can, they can have it.
Okay.
Um, so, you guys are, yeah, um, so you guys are disarmed and are let into the keep.
Um, we're taken into, um, the king's chamber.
Um, and sitting at, on the throne is the king himself.
Um, King Hargrin Deepmantle.
However, um, he is not alone.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
He does have, um, the captain of the guard, um, Bramley Stoneguard.
We like him.
Um, with a few of his personal guards around him, as stated previously.
Um.
And.
Um.
And also, um, Varric Silvervane is there, as well.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
We don't like him.
No.
Very notably.
Mm-hmm.
Speaking of notes, uh, who has that evidence?
I don't know one of us does, but I forget where's one of us.
I ended.
Good question.
Uh.
I'm not sure.
I mean, I mean, really, at this point, some, one of you would have picked that up.
Yeah.
Yeah, for sure.
For sure.
Um.
Yeah.
Like, you guys can just, you guys can just make that call of who's got it.
Um, I don't think, I don't think that, I don't think that that's that big of a deal from that
perspective.
So, you.
I thought I had grabbed that, but I don't, I don't see it in my inventory specifically.
I don't know.
Yeah.
There might not have been.
There might not have been an inventory.
But yeah, it's all yours.
Demlor, you have it.
Yep.
Oh, okay.
I do know that, that Demlor, I think you were the one who took the recording stick and used,
used that, right?
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, so you're the one.
I did that as well.
So you, like, it would make sense that you're the, that you're the evidence gatherer of the
group.
So, unless you wanted to kind of have it distributed, distributed out amongst you guys just for security
purposes, but.
Either way.
Yep.
Yep.
Okay.
For now, I've got it.
I think that's good.
All right.
All right.
We will call that good.
So, King Deepmantle looks at you from his throne to his right.
He has, um, he has Varric Silvervane sitting in an advisory seat, um, as well as Bramley
Stoneguard standing behind him.
And Bramley has four of his, um, four of his guards with him.
Um.
And King, uh, King Deepmantle, um, looks out to you and says, um, well, Matt, I was not
expecting to see you, um, according to your message, you were, um, trapped in the, um, in
the Sentinels' Rise watchtower.
How did you escape?
Um.
I'll bow slash kneel, whatever's appropriate in this culture.
Uh.
Yep.
Um.
And say, Sire, uh, we, we apologize.
Um.
We, uh, needed to hide our true location from the enemy.
Um.
And I'll kind of look at, uh, look at Demalor with kind of like a.
Mm-hmm.
The enemy.
You.
You sent the message to.
To us.
Are we the enemy?
Others.
And is that the, uh.
We're listening.
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
It appears, Varric, that you are correct.
There are those that would, um, those that would wish to, uh, usurp me.
Tell me.
Do you have a name?
I think it might be better if you saw for yourself, Sire.
You know, kind of.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um.
Yeah.
So.
So.
So.
Start, uh, producing.
Some, uh, artifacts, so to speak.
All right.
How are you producing these artifacts?
Uh.
I mean, not, not what kind of flair.
Uh, I'm not asking that, are you?
Um.
But more along the lines of, are you going, are you revealing one at a time?
Or are you just going to drop all of the, are you going to do an info dump?
Like, what's your, uh, what's your approach here?
Are you picking up what I'm asking?
Or.
I am.
Um.
Yeah.
It's, uh.
How subtle and tactful do we want to be?
Uh.
How subtle and tactful would Denlor be, I guess, is the question.
Right?
Uh.
Let me, let me, let me look at my tact here.
I think that's a specific attribute of mine.
It is.
Well, negative one charisma, intelligence plus three.
Ooh.
Uh, what, but you do, but, but, you do have a society of eleven.
Yeah, because I have wisdom and intelligence.
Right.
Right.
Right.
So, your society would inform you as far as, like, what's appropriate versus not appropriate
within a, within a.
Civilizations.
So.
Right.
Um.
That's kind of what it is.
It's effectively like knowledge nature, only it's for civilization.
How people function together.
Mm-hmm.
So, um, so, um, so, this one, so, you could lean into your society as you're making a decision
about what you're, uh, about how you're going to be doing what you're doing, um, or
you could just be like, oh, I got a charisma of negative one, so, it's, it's going to be
what it's going to be.
So, either way, it's completely legitimate, but I did just want to make sure that you knew
that you do have a skill that could apply in this situation.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, that's a, yeah, that's a good reminder.
Um.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Hmm.
Okay.
But you also have zero performance, so you got zero flavor.
Oh, I mean, yeah, that's the deal.
Like, I'm not, like, I'm not pretty about it, but, essentially, Trader sits within the
room.
He starts looking around.
Okay, so, when you say that, there are a couple things that happen.
Uh-huh.
A couple things that you notice, um, specifically.
So, one, uh, you see the, um, you see the king look around in alarm, as if there was somebody
in the, uh, in the room that he has not seen.
Uh-huh.
Mm-hmm.
And, two, you see Varric, because you are paying attention to Varric, guaranteeing me,
um, you see his eyes narrow.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Um, it's like, you know something, but, you know, it's kind of like, you, you can see it
on his face.
He's like, you know something that you shouldn't.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
And, also, the guard all are a lot more alert.
And, um, Captain Bromley, um, specifically, has his, goes from having his hand resting
on his sword hilt to having his hand ready to unsheathe his sword at a moment's notice.
Um, the guards themselves, um, are kind of uncertain, they're, like, looking around, kind
of like what the king is.
Um, but Captain Bromley is looking where you are, um, as if he, but he suspected all along
might, in fact, be true.
All right, so that's, that's what happens when you say that.
Please continue.
I'm, uh, start the, uh, what do you think?
Should we start with the video image and the aftermath of the attack?
And, uh, go from there?
Okay.
I, like, I'm asking Roeck and Hurden.
Uh.
Don't, sorry, I'm, Ramsey's trying to remember, don't we have an actual thing signed by Varick?
You do.
We got that also.
Okay.
Yeah, the question that, that, that, yeah, yeah.
I'm asking is, do we want to lead with that or do we want to show what happens that leads
us to that?
Yeah.
Let's have some good courtroom drama.
Let's build up to it.
I'm a visual learner.
I don't think that's how Roeck would put it, but yeah, let's, let's start with the video.
Right, right.
Whatever that is.
Like Salem.
So I, I produced the, um, the recording stick.
Okay.
Um, and you, you were the one that took that video.
Can you describe what you recorded?
Right, what we were recording.
Um.
Or if you remember, like, I, I, I remember, but I want you to, as it was, I was getting
the recording stick out, I think, as the last shot was being fired at the, the final earth
troll.
Okay.
Um.
Um, and so I took a, a recording of the three of us, right?
It took a shot of each of us that you could clearly see our faces and all the wounds.
Um, I don't know that I caught the, the troll in his death throes per se, but I did, I did
take a shot of all of the trolls.
There was one who hadn't gotten through the portal yet, and then the other three who had
gotten into the portals.
And then I took a very clear shot of the giant.
And then.
Okay, go ahead.
And then it was over to the chest or satchel.
Okay.
Um, so when, like, the, the king looks at all of, all of the video evidence, um, sees the
trolls and he's like, wait.
And the circles of power are in that, or what do you want to call them?
Yeah, yeah.
The, the rings of quorum is the, is the name of that.
Yes, rings of quorum.
Yeah.
Um, he says, wait, where, where is that?
That looks familiar, but I don't.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The rings of quorum.
Outside of, uh, what, what, what was the tower?
Uh, the sentinels rise.
Sentinels rise.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um, he, he, he looks at you in shock and says, I've never known those to actually work.
Those are, that, that's an ancient legend, an ancient artifact that is before, before memory.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
And, oh, oh, so are the giants.
And these, well, and that's the thing, it's like, so he, he says that, and I'm assuming
that you're showing, like, pieces at a time and giving him time to react to them.
So, um, he, so he, he just has this kind of, like, wondrous look about the rings of quorum,
um, working and kind of seeing what, what, what happened to these trolls?
Um, did the, did the rings do that to them?
Yeah, the, the giant has figured out to.
Wait, giant?
What?
Yeah, that one.
Fast forward to the giant.
Yeah, that guy right there.
Reversed.
He, and he, he, and when, when he sees, when he sees the giant, he just, he jumps to his
feet, um, in surprise and shock and, um, and, and you see, and, and you see a little
bit of fear popping up in his, popping up as well.
Not inappropriate?
Nope.
Nope.
Probably need a new pair of underpants.
At that, Varric.
After the last week.
Right.
Um, at that, Varric responds, clearly this is an altered image.
There's, there's, we've, we've, we know that the giants have not existed for over a millennia.
There's no, there's, the, the, they must have, they must have done something magical to
this, to this recording rod to make something that looks like a giant.
This is not, this cannot be true.
What we need to focus on, Sire, is the trolls and the ogres in the south.
They are our true threat.
These, these people, I warned you against using them.
I did not think that they would be trustworthy, and this proves it.
That there's no reason for us to believe that giants exist still when they've been extinct
for over a millennia.
Um, as he's, like, talking, I'm digging in my pack.
Like, not like, whatever.
I'm pulling out, uh, the giant battle map.
Um, and I'll kind of present that, uh, to one of the guards to then take to the king,
because I'm assuming I'm not handing shit directly to the king.
Um.
That is correct.
Yep.
Uh, and I'll say, interesting.
Um.
And I'll kind of, like, look at the three of us.
Um.
Well, no, that's not entirely accurate, is it?
Hmm.
Shit.
Hmm.
I forgot.
Jason, you are kind of magic, aren't you?
Uh.
I mean, not exactly, but kind of.
I'm, I'm not.
And, and that's kind of, like, that's the line that I want to take, but.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That was going to be my tack, too.
I don't think so.
I think I'd rather say, why don't we get our, our arcane master in here to see how much any of us could tamper with this.
Yeah.
It is easily verifiable.
If you want to call.
As is this map.
If you want to call it into question, so be it.
Um.
There are ways of testing the accuracy of this rod's images.
I'm sure.
Did we get anything with the giant footsteps when we first saw them at the first place we went to?
I don't know if we got evidence on it, but the, the battle map definitely has a location that's very clearly marked giant war camp.
Yes.
Um.
Let me see if I can pull it up here.
Mm-hmm.
The, the one to the northeast.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Yeah, and then we got to just let this progress to the letter with his signature.
Mm-hmm.
And as when, um, uh, when Demlor is, is, is done saying that about getting the arcane master in here, I'll kind of look right at Varric and say, um, as we will soon see.
Um, and kind of like nod and bow to the king, sire.
Uh, our word is trustworthy.
And then glare daggers back at Varric.
Ha ha ha ha.
Uh.
Ah.
Ah.
All right.
I didn't know if it looked like a selfie inside that giant footprints that we found.
I don't think so.
Jason had that thing out.
Yeah, that recorder thing, I think, can only store like one thing at a time.
Yeah, it's one, yeah, you get one, one image, and I don't remember how long it is, but, like, once you use it, like, that's it.
You have to delete what's on it, essentially, to record a new thing, so.
Yeah.
Uh, so this is the, uh, this is the map fragment that, um, Varric produces.
Um.
Uh, to which that Varric says, giant war camp could mean anything.
Could mean that there's a, that there's a large war camp that direction.
But at the same time, I didn't, at the same time, I would not trust them.
Um.
The, as you guys are speaking and showing this evidence, um, you can tell that Varric is doing his best to spin a web that would remove him from implication.
However, the king is starting to get suspicious.
Um.
And he says, but the clear, the clear thing that we need to focus on is the threat that is known, not these shadows that this, that this group of, uh, that this small group of people who aren't even a part of our military are spinning this tale for you.
We know that there are ogres to the south.
We don't know anything about the rest of, the rest of what they say.
No.
No.
You don't know.
Uh, you know that there are ogres to the south.
So you know there are ogres to the south, because we went, and we fought, and we killed them, and we brought back this evidence.
That map is from the war camp that we slaughtered.
Where we rescued, what, two dozen of our fellow countrymen?
And so, Varric, it seems like you're putting a lot of confidence in our testimony concerning the war camp to the south.
Or you're getting a lot of confidence from information that you've already known.
Which is it?
You, you, you, you, you aren't the only ones that saw the ogres.
We're, we are going off of the evidence of, of the, we're going off the evidence of the refugees as well.
So, he blusters as, as, as he knows that he's kind of losing, he's losing the, the lines of logic.
The king says, enough.
Let's stop arguing for now.
Call for Baelgrin, our archmage.
I want him to be here for the, for, for, for the confirmation of the evidence.
Um, one of the guards goes off, um, and doesn't take long at all.
Um, Baelgrin was already in the keep.
Um, and you see, um, a ancient dwarf, um, kind of totters.
His way in, uh, into the king's chamber.
And he says, sire, you called for me?
King says, then the king basically instructs him to take the recording rod that, um, that
Demlor showed, and then to, um, assess whether the recording has been tampered with.
Um, to which Baelgrin kind of looks at it a little hopefully and says,
A recording rod only records once, and it cannot be re-recorded.
So I don't see it actually doing anything.
I, I don't see there being any way to tamper with it.
Um, but I'll test it.
Mm-hmm.
And, and, and, he, he's kind of thinking that this is well below his payday.
Um, at this point.
He's just like, ah, okay, fine.
Um, after a few, he's like, I am an archmage of the highest order, and you're having me
check a recording rod.
What the heck?
You know?
That's funny.
Um, that's funny.
So after a few minutes, he, he does go through it, and he comes back and he says, I can confirm.
This is the original recording.
Okay.
And if it is the original recording, from which I've just confirmed that, this is a
very disturbing, this is a very disturbing thing that has happened.
Would you be so kind as to confirm that we have not tampered with that map as well?
Um, he takes it, looks at it.
Um, yeah.
Um, and he goes, he goes off into a corner and, um, and comes back, um, after a few minutes.
And he says, not only can I confirm that this is an original map that shows the world in a
way that we do not know, nor has it been this way, very, um, in, in known memory.
So either this is a pre, um, a pre, um, a prehistory map in which something happened to the environment,
or this is the results of the flaming retribution.
Um, not only can I confirm that, but I can confirm who is the owner and, or who is the, the owner
of, of the map.
Um, give me one second.
Um, it, the, uh, and as he reveals the map, there are some, there are actually like glowing
runes that are on it that weren't on it before.
So through his arcane arts, he was able to reveal additional secrets in the map that
you, that you weren't able to, um, that's new.
Excellent.
Um, and, and, and the, and the language that's, and the runes themselves aren't a language
that you recognize.
Oh, yeah.
But, um, but Baelgrin says, these, these runes are.
Uh, he says, these runes represent a name.
Um, actually, it represents two names.
The first is Rondar Earthcaller.
Um, and then following that is the title, Hi-Tripe Master.
The second is Korak Flintshard.
And after that is the word for general, although it doesn't directly translate.
Anyway, these runes are made in a ancient dialect of giant.
Um, at that, Farrick says, traitors.
Two of them, or four of them.
There's no way that this is true.
Um, and at this point, he's just grabbing at whatever straws he can get.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Um.
Are you trying to leave?
From which, well, from which he, he has gotten to his feet.
And he has moved away from the throne and away from the guards.
Um, but, Bromley has also been kind of inching his way towards him.
Um, so he's not too far away from him.
Um.
Is there a, a, an obvious close exit, uh, for him?
Um, there is not an obvious close exit.
Um, however, um, if you would like to, um, as, let's see, as a metal kineticist, if you
would like to make some sort of roll to determine, um, if there are any secret, um, any things
that look like metal, um, like metal doors and, and that kind of thing, um, in the area,
I will let you, I will let you do that.
So, like, if you've got some way of being able to channel elements and, and detect, detect
metal, I think you've got something like that.
Um, then you can totally do that as you're, as you're trying to see any, like, notice any,
um, any secret exits.
Uh, you can also use your perception just to do that as well.
So, um.
The, when, when Belgrin Deep Delve, um, when, um, the Archmage Deep Delve gets, um, gets
accused of being a traitor, he kind of looks at Varric confused and says, I've served the
Deep Mantle, the Deep Mantle family for over five generations.
Why would I turn traitor now?
Uh, good question, Belgrin.
I think it's time to accuse this guy so he doesn't run off.
Uh, I believe we have one final piece of evidence to present and be verified.
Uh, Sire, I would suggest no one be allowed to leave this room.
Uh, he nods at the guards, the guards cover all of the main exits, um, and, um, as, as, um, Varric
kind of, like, is trying to inch away, Bramley basically ends up walking, just walking up to
him and, and, and put it, and puts his hand on his shoulder and says, hold friend.
He looks back, so he's going, wow!
He looks back, so he's going, wow!
He looks back, so he's going, wow!
Pretty much.
Pretty much.
Pretty much.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Love it.
All right.
Um, the king, the king says, all right, let's, let's hear this final piece of evidence that
you've claimed.
Hmm.
I am.
He's still, he's still giving an air of skepticism, but also, you know, he doesn't, he, he's kind
of picking up that there's something fishy going on, but at the same time, like, he doesn't
want to believe where he thinks you're going, so.
Yeah, I don't blame him for that.
All right, Jason, you were saying?
Um.
I think.
Interesting.
Um.
All right.
Yeah, I'm just going to, uh, hold on to that for a second.
Um.
Let me, I'm not going to do it that way.
I'm going to.
Do a.
Can I, can I do, what, what, what would I do?
Would I do, um.
Would it really be a stealth check?
It would be perception.
Right?
To find hidden doors.
Yep.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And all, and, yeah, and as a metal kineticist, I would give you a plus two to your roll for,
for that.
In case the door, in case there are some metal doors.
Mm-hmm.
All right.
Um.
All right.
So.
Where's the best place for me to do that roll?
Is that in the skills?
Um, no.
Perception is not a skill.
Not really a skill, is it?
Um, I would say, so there's a, in the, in the HUD, there's an eyeball.
To the eyeball?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Click the eyeball.
Um, and then when you.
You want me to add a plus two?
Yep.
Add a plus two circumstance bonus, um, to there.
So, just where it says modifier plus, plus one circumstance, just add a plus two, and
then click the add button, and that'll, and that'll give you just a default plus two.
Oh, okay.
It looks like a circumstance bonus plus three.
Okay.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Not a circumstance bonus.
Um.
Make it a status bonus.
Do you already have a circumstance bonus for pursue a lead?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I do.
Yep, you're right.
Um, and I want to give you a plus two to the roll, so I don't want to give you, like, a
a plus one, because you've got, you've already got a circumstance bonus, so.
Great.
There we go.
I think we're set there.
I rolled a dice.
Okay.
I have no idea what I rolled.
All right, so you do, you do recognize that there are, uh, there are a couple of secret
exits that, that are in this room.
Um, one is right behind the king's, um, throne.
Um, so you were able to pick that one up more out of, like, kind of what you were feeling,
uh, feeling out with your kineticist abilities, but there's, like, a trap door behind the king's
throne, which is not anywhere near, um, where.
Um, our DLF.
Yeah.
Our, our, yes, our, our dear little friend is.
Um, he was moving off to stage right.
Um, which has a, another hidden door behind one of the tapestries that he was kind of inching
towards.
Um, he's not within, um, he's not within, like, he was getting to the point where he was going to be within distance of being able to make a run for it.
Um, but with Bromley having, you know, a hand on the shoulder, cured him.
Yeah.
Um, he's, he's not, he's not moving anywhere.
Okay.
Excellent.
I will still, in the back of my mind, be like, all right, we're going to just, we're going to cover that door in a steel plate.
Um, so you just can't even get to it.
Um.
Okay.
If I need, if I need to, that's what he's, in the back of his mind, that's what he's prepping.
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Um.
Okay.
So, yeah, final piece of, of evidence that you were, um, alluding to, uh, produce the, the document.
Um.
Say, should it first be verified by the wizard, or should it just go directly to the king?
Uh, the king basically just puts out his hand.
Mm-hmm.
He's like, I, I will take it.
Love guards.
Nonsense.
Yep.
Um, yeah, so guard grabs it.
Yep.
Uh, he hands it to you, or he, he, he gets a hold of it.
Um, and when he, uh, takes it, he looks at it, starts reading through it.
Um, and says, send that to the king.
Shh.
Yeah.
Um, looks at it, looks at Varric, and says,
I was under the impression that no one had access to your seal but you.
Mm-hmm.
Um.
To which Varric starts blustering and saying,
that, that, that, that letter doesn't, that letter doesn't, doesn't mean anything.
I, I, I wasn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't send it.
There was nothing going on.
Uh, the, the, the, the, I, I knew nothing about, uh, about the, uh, about the guard towers.
There's nothing going on.
Uh, that, it's not my fault.
Um.
Which the king said, the king says,
now no one mentioned anything about guard towers.
Uh.
Uh, Varric's just having the time of his life and
sitting over there, just big old smile on his face.
Um, I am, uh, I'm, I am, I am, it's, half a second from activating my, uh, so my whole thing.
Um, the, the, the king, the king looks at, looks at Varric, um, and says,
Bramley, bring him here.
To which Bramley,
may not ungently,
moves Varric
to the, uh,
to the, uh,
to,
right in front of the king.
Mm-hmm.
And he
looks him in the eye and he says,
um,
why would you betray your own kin?
And Varric,
and Varric continues to bluster about how he's innocent and there's no,
um,
and
this is,
this is all a setup.
Um,
it wasn't,
it wasn't him.
He wasn't,
he,
he wasn't,
um,
he,
he wasn't responsible for what was happening,
um,
to which it's kind of interesting because Varric up until this point seemed like such a big personality to everyone.
And in this state,
in where he is,
you are reminded of how small and petty he actually is.
Um,
after,
after a few moments of blustering,
um,
the king just says,
Bromley,
secure him.
We need
to figure out what's going on.
Um,
to which Bromley calls a few guards over,
puts Varric in shackles,
and they escort him out of the room.
Um,
he looks at the three of you
and says,
now tell me what's really going on here.
Well,
um,
first of all,
majesty,
I apologize again for the necessary deception.
we,
when we sent the message,
we,
I'm trying to remember,
actually,
we did know who exactly the traitor was.
Um,
we knew that there was,
where it was.
Okay.
Okay.
We did not,
we still don't know about the master spy chick.
That's true.
Uh,
we,
we were very uncomfortable with her.
Yes.
Yeah.
We,
we could not risk,
uh,
knowing that there were enemies within,
uh,
we could not risk sending true communication back.
Um,
we gambled on being able to catch the traitor or traitors by surprise.
We have no evidence of anyone else,
but I suspect where there's one,
there may be more.
Yes.
The rest have a tendency to flow together or work together.
Mm-hmm.
Um,
the rest,
I think you've managed to piece together.
I mean,
as far as we can tell,
uh,
our kingdom is under great threat.
The giants are a fact,
in fact,
awakened,
returned.
Um,
and they've been plotting.
They are not weak.
No.
They're not,
they are not weak.
They're plotting with the,
the ogres,
the trolls,
and apparently some number of dwarves.
Let's see.
I would believe that there is an attack eminent,
from the northeast.
Hmm.
Yes.
To rule out a threat from the south,
I don't think we can do.
And we can,
and we can trust this battle map.
Where did you get it?
The battle map we stole from.
I know you,
you said you got it.
Yeah.
I,
I know you said you got it from the ogres.
Yeah.
In that camp.
You could have gotten it.
Yes.
But,
tell me,
tell me the circumstances.
I need
details of your travels
in order to know what to do.
Yep.
Um,
and I won't make you guys rehash the entire adventure.
Yep.
But,
um,
any,
any details that you specifically want to provide to him,
or not provide to him,
um,
here's your,
here's your opportunity.
Yeah.
no,
I don't think,
uh,
hold anything back at this point.
Um,
not much to hold back.
Right.
I will definitely let him know,
especially about the weird magic that is turning.
Oh my God.
I mean,
dwarves into elemental creatures,
like seem to be mind controlled.
And,
uh,
where,
where in anything,
where trolls.
Yeah.
I kind of hope that one was a one-off,
but probably worth mentioning.
Right.
Um,
just like,
we need to be kind of prepared for just about anything.
There was,
uh,
a,
a dragon or,
you know,
fireworm of some sort that was tracking us for a while.
And then we didn't deal with that.
So I,
I wouldn't rule that out of the,
of the equation.
We never really encountered whatever it was that destroyed,
uh,
sentinels rise.
And that wouldn't have probably been a,
a small force.
Um,
so that,
that enemy is still about in the South,
it would seem.
Um,
so I don't think that to say that there's no threat to the South is a wise thing.
That's not,
no,
but,
um,
definitely like,
it looks to be that there is an imminent attack,
um,
from the North.
All right.
And that might be the stronger of the,
of the force.
I think we've weakened the,
the Southern attack a bit already.
Well,
given,
given how insistent Farrick has been,
not just in this council,
but in all of his councils about focusing on the South,
I would say that you are probably correct.
Um,
very well.
We will send scouts to the North,
to the Northeast,
to see what's on the other side of the mountains.
Um,
we have not needed to look that direction.
So we've been ignoring it,
but it seems that that has been to our peril.
Um,
and we will,
of course,
send reinforcements to the South,
um,
but not the full mustering of,
of our forces.
Um,
you've all done well.
I thank you for your service.
and you,
what,
whatever,
whatever boon,
um,
or,
um,
whatever boon you would,
you would wish,
um,
from me,
or from all of Ironhold,
um,
is yours.
You are no strangers to being heroes among us,
but,
um,
we,
we really appreciate what you've done for,
done for us.
Um,
at the very least,
um,
and he,
he offers,
he offers you each an appropriate sum of money.
Um,
I don't have a specific number in mind,
but it's,
it's an appropriate reward.
Billion.
One billion gold pieces.
Um,
but he offers you an appropriate reward for,
for what you have done in the service that you've,
that you've gotten.
Um,
and you do have the favor of the king.
Um,
excellent.
What that,
um,
just,
which is a pretty awesome reward in of itself.
That in and of itself is a great reward.
Um,
I would ask for one thing.
Um,
you,
well,
uh,
before,
before we get,
before we get to that favor from which,
uh,
we will definitely get to it.
Um,
you have been,
um,
all,
all three of you for services to the king.
Um,
have been,
uh,
will get knighted as wardens of the granite crown.
Um,
which is a honorary tighter title.
It's not a,
um,
it's not like you are now part of a knightly order or anything like that.
It's like being knighted in,
in Britain.
It's like,
you know,
and it's still a big deal,
but it doesn't restrict you at all is my point.
Sure,
sure,
sure.
It's a military rank and that's the responsibility associated with it.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Um,
you are also,
um,
known as the Ember Guard of Dagger's Sheath to the common folk.
Were you?
Now,
your boon,
uh,
Rurik,
or Demlor,
sorry,
wrong dwarf.
Right player,
wrong dwarf.
Mm-hmm.
Um,
um,
a comfortable bed to sleep in.
Mm-hmm.
At least for one night.
You are,
you are given the most,
you are given the best feather bed that you could ever ask for.
Um,
it's some,
it's like these feathers are made in a way that it's,
it's,
it's reminiscent of memory foam,
but memory foam doesn't exist in this world.
So they have some sort of magical means of making memory feathers.
Exactly.
Um,
so like your lumbar is highly supported in that.
Oh,
perfect.
Um,
so you are,
you are granted,
you are granted that for sure.
As the rest of you are probably tired as well.
You are,
you are given the ability to,
to sleep and,
um,
and rest.
Upon,
um,
upon waking,
you will have discovered that the king sent out his scouts,
and within very short order,
there was a,
there was in fact a camp to the north that was a force that was far greater than what,
um,
you saw to the south by its description.
You also found out that the,
um,
that the island to the northwest that you saw that you didn't recognize does indeed exist.
Um,
it is a new,
it is new land that wasn't there before.
So,
um,
it was a new formation that happened,
um,
as part of,
um,
you would assume as part of the flaming retribution.
Um,
so land masses switched and changed,
and,
um,
you haven't seen too much of that effect here in this area.
Um,
but one of the things that you do see is now you have a,
an island that is,
um,
where there were a couple of islands there that were small.
Now there's this giant,
um,
this giant island that,
that is off the coast.
And it appears that there are giant forces that are on that island,
as well as a force that is,
that was attempting to sneak over the mountain,
but it was discovered.
Um,
and with that,
the war with the giants has begun anew.
yeah,
I'd love a little ambush on that encampment would,
uh,
be fantastic.
Yep.
Um,
so,
basically what happens now is,
um,
the,
um,
giants being discovered,
having known that they are now,
um,
that they're now discovered,
they are,
um,
uh,
they,
they go into full military,
um,
uh,
military attack mode,
rather than going around and being reclusive.
Upon the,
um,
searching of Varric's,
um,
homes and his personal,
um,
his personal,
um,
connections,
um,
it was discovered that he has been in correspondence with Grandar Earthcaller
for quite some time,
um,
at least for the past year,
if not longer.
Um,
the plot that he was working with is he made a deal with Grandar that if he handed him the Dwarven Kingdom as,
um,
as a,
uh,
conquered,
um,
as a conquered nation,
then Grandar would instill him,
would,
would instill him as the leader of the Dwarven people.
Um,
and being that Varric was in line for the Kingdom,
but was not,
like,
the next in line for the Kingdom,
um,
he did not like his chances of becoming king on his own,
so he chose to work with the ancient enemy of the Dwarves in order to be able to accomplish his goal.
Unfortunately,
he would,
and he would have gotten away with it too,
if it wasn't for you kids.
Um,
Smuddling Dwarves.
You meddling Dwarves.
We probably saved his damn life too,
because they probably just,
we killed him.
Yeah.
Well,
and,
yeah,
and that is something that,
like,
that,
that is absolutely true.
Um,
well,
could have been true.
Right,
right.
But,
but I would also say,
like,
um,
for,
um,
for this as well,
the,
um,
you guys,
you,
the,
the information that you gathered about the elemental,
um,
the elemental Dwarves,
and the elemental creatures and things,
it appears that the,
the,
um,
that the giants are actually working with,
um,
like,
elemental princes of the elemental planes,
in order to gain power.
Mm-hmm.
Um,
which has helped modify and increase the potency of their,
of their magic.
Um,
but it's also given them the ability to,
um,
to make thralls,
um,
which is what you guys had seen.
Right.
The Dwarves that are captured and enthralled in the elemental forces,
um,
pretty much at that point become like,
um,
androids.
So,
they are alive,
but their minds are completely blank,
and they only do what they're instructed to do by their handlers.
And,
um,
which,
you know,
causes some problems.
Um,
that Azer that you ran into,
that,
that,
um,
fire dwarf,
that fire-like dwarf creature,
was not,
in fact,
a thrall.
That was an elemental,
of the elemental plane.
Ah.
So,
it was different.
Yep.
Yep.
Yep.
Yep.
Yep.
Yep.
Yep.
Um,
and,
so,
but,
but that's,
that's another aspect of the giants.
The giant army.
So,
the giant army is,
um,
not only powerful because of the giants,
but they've also,
um,
they've also allied themselves with the elemental planes themselves.
Um,
and while there are,
and,
and the elemental planes,
um,
as far as like deities are concerned,
the elemental planes have two polar opposites,
uh,
as far as deities are,
uh,
are concerned in this world.
So,
you've got like,
um,
you've got a good elemental,
um,
elemental God and a evil elemental,
elemental God.
Um,
and they are polar opposites.
So,
like,
you've got a fire one,
you've got an air one,
you've got an earth one,
a metal one,
um,
a wood one.
Um,
and,
uh,
and that's kind of like how the elements themselves are,
are equalized is you have both poles that are,
you know,
kind of pulling against each other,
which basically makes the element itself just neutral.
Um,
so instead of having like one deity that is neutral,
it's the,
um,
it's the friction between the two deities that make the element either positive or negative.
Like it,
it doesn't have a,
it's not positive.
It's not negative.
It's just kind of,
it is what it is.
It's that dichotomy that creates that.
Okay.
Um,
so yeah,
and you guys,
you guys kind of,
as things go on,
you,
you discover these sorts of things and also they build their,
the door,
the,
the giants are,
you know,
can,
are increasing their number by capturing,
um,
by capturing dwarves and other things and turning them into thralls.
The war has begun.
Whether or not that,
whether or not the dwarven kingdom will,
will,
um,
will succeed or fail,
um,
is not in the,
is not in the scope of this story.
Um,
you have saved the kingdom from complete annihilation by a snake with a sword.
Within the snake within the borders.
You have saved the king,
you've saved the kingdom,
and you have,
um,
given the kingdom a fighting chance.
Um,
now,
I would like to ask you,
um,
how you see your character moving forward in the,
um,
in the world and the war or the world or the war,
he,
they,
they might decide that your characters might decide not to be involved.
Um,
but how do you see your character moving forward in this,
um,
in this world,
um,
to,
you know,
in the future?
So why don't we start off with Ramsey?
Um,
if you've got any ideas.
Absolutely.
Uh,
so Rurik,
um,
the,
boon Rurik asks for from the king is for,
uh,
his clan to be reinstated,
um,
as a member of the gear grinds.
Um,
and that investigation be reopened into,
I don't know if I ever figured out exactly what it was,
whatever it was that his father was accused of that got them turned clanless to begin with.
Um,
you know,
if,
uh,
if it turns out his father was actually guilty of it,
then so be it.
But I think Rurik's own deeds has proved enough for at least his reinstatement,
if not his father's.
Um,
from there,
uh,
he will,
uh,
certainly join the war effort.
Uh,
before this adventure,
he was probably quite a bit jaded.
Um,
you know,
kind of just for himself doing what he could.
Um,
but,
uh,
facing the larger threat,
the larger enemy,
and finding camaraderie among this group,
uh,
of,
of fellow dwarves,
kind of changed his mind a bit.
Um,
so he's all in on the war effort.
Um,
I kind of see him both primarily rising the ranks of the gear grind and being more inventor
than a frontline soldier.
Although he definitely likes to go out and do that as well when the need arises.
All right.
Cool.
Did I cut you off or was that?
No,
no,
no,
no.
All right.
That's pretty much what I got.
Awesome.
That is,
that's really cool.
All right.
Um,
Jason,
do you have any ideas for Demlor?
Um,
having witnessed the things that Demlor has with the,
um,
the giants regarding the,
yeah,
kind of the,
the merging of,
of the different elements and accessing,
uh,
the elements,
uh,
looks to me more like through the arcane opposed to,
um,
his method.
Um,
he's,
he's wondering,
uh,
first,
if,
um,
I don't know our wizard's name here,
but,
um,
if,
if there's any connection,
um,
that we can work out and see if there's a way to,
um,
kind of accomplish some of those enhancements that the,
the giants were doing to help bolster and boost,
um,
the Dwarven army,
um,
and,
and maybe working as a,
uh,
more like a,
a trainer in that art.
Uh,
but definitely,
like,
definitely wanting to continue our,
our roguish dwarf type activities of going in somewhat stealthy,
um,
if,
if,
uh,
our three comrades here are still willing to go out in the field and take on a
couple of missions here or there that are particularly,
um,
sensitive or,
or critical to the,
the larger effort.
And there's a strategic attack that needs to be executed.
man,
he'd,
he'd be,
uh,
just frothing at the mouth for such an activity.
So.
All right.
Um,
okay.
Excellent.
So,
um,
something,
something that you are able to do,
there was that one Dwarf that was partially,
um,
that was partially converted,
but you saved in the,
in the tent.
Um,
you are able to work with,
um,
Baelgrin,
which is the archmage.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
And that,
and that Dwarf to be able to create,
um,
to be able to add some additional elemental capabilities to the Dwarf,
to certain Dwarves who have certain,
um,
who have certain dispositions.
Yes.
Um,
so,
uh,
and with that effort,
you are able to help support the war effort and give the Dwarven,
uh,
give the Dwarven community a fighting chance.
Um,
with your,
um,
with your thoughts of like,
you know,
more stealthy missions and that kind of thing,
you guys are,
you're definitely able to go in and gain important information,
um,
and reclaim knowledge that,
um,
is knowledge that time forgot.
Um,
as the giants themselves are out of myth and legend,
some of the things that they're able to do are things that,
um,
yeah,
you,
you remember in the stories are things that,
um,
the Dwarves and the Dwarven kingdom used to do,
but,
aren't,
but nobody now knows what they do.
Um,
so you're able to kind of bring in some of those ancient magics and ancient,
um,
and ancient secrets back to your people.
Um,
Scott,
do you have any ideas for Hergen?
Um,
I just,
I'm assuming this,
um,
is not going to play into what we do next,
but I mean,
I'm just,
Hergen's not going to be one to stay in the city.
He's going to go out with the others.
If these guys want to stick together or go towards the war effort,
but particularly just wanting to,
like,
what's the right word?
Um,
discover more of that Island too.
I think that would be appropriate,
like focus or whatever.
All right.
No,
that's great.
Well,
I don't think I would go South with everybody else.
I think I would want to go North into the Island.
Okay.
So Hergen becomes more of an espionage expert in the,
uh,
in,
in the,
in the giant territory,
um,
known for going into the,
uh,
going into,
um,
Far Grand,
I believe it's called,
um,
the,
the new Island that was created.
Um,
let me confirm,
but I believe that's what you said.
Yep.
Far Grand.
Yep.
Um,
so you,
so you are able to go back into Far Grand and,
um,
basically pull in,
um,
information from behind enemy lines.
Um,
obviously you work with your friends and your compatriots,
um,
as much as you can.
Uh,
but sometimes your,
um,
sometimes your,
uh,
priorities and their priorities conflict.
And in,
and in those cases,
like you're the one who go,
you know,
you go into,
um,
into the back territory,
um,
fearlessly,
um,
jumping into that giant territory.
And in so doing,
you are able to discover,
um,
secrets and battle and find battle plans,
um,
from,
from the very,
um,
from the very tables that the giants,
um,
make them from.
Um,
you become an expert at,
um,
at espionage,
um,
as well as your nature lore allows you to be able to navigate through these new lands in,
in brand new ways.
Um,
each one of you provides a vital,
um,
a vital function to the war effort,
um,
in the,
in the battles and,
um,
fights with the giants,
um,
and that is the end of the cracked granite.
