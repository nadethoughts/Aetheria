you guys are understanding
all right when uh when last we met uh the group had traveled from the
traveled from the watchtower of
uh the group had been being hunted by a um by the ogres um parties which
uh two of the three major threats the group um did end up running into um the group of werewolves
the the group with werewolf and the wolves um happened the time before the session before
this session there was a cyclops who was traveling with a spider companion that was
even larger than him um that had ambushed the uh the group and the 21 dwarves that they that they
were escorting um rurik demlor and her again were able to defeat those
um they were able to defeat those baddies and um proceeded on to hammergate hold
uh where they met captain ember helm um he he took them in um heard your story and uh very quickly
decided to start reaching out to the other watchtowers to make sure that everybody was on red
alert in case uh a attack should happen although he did seem a slightly dubious when you started
talking about or did you talk about giants i think you avoided talking about giants oh you talked about
ogres yeah we did not talk about giants specifically yeah yeah yeah yeah so he uh so he heard about the
ogres and um immediately brought the uh brought the watchtower to red alert and sent messages out to the other watchtowers
and also sent out um a scout to see where things have landed um the next day uh he informed you guys that
the sentinels rise watchtower had not been had not responded um and he suspected that there might be
something um there there might be something afoot with that um as that was an hour or two out of your
way and heading towards ironhold he asked you to swing by and take a look at it uh from what you did
in so de doing you discovered that the sentinels rise had been um been raised raised oh um
yes and so uh you didn't find any specific survivors um but you did find some footprints of
some large footprints um some you were able to identify as troll footprints and then you saw some
other footprints that you didn't recognize um specifically and there were some um very
odd looking hairs um looked like it was almost like a heavy fur sort of hair that was on that that
you you identified but you didn't know you didn't know what it could be belong to
on your way to the watchtower you did pass the rings of quorum um which are a dwarven um
a dwarven ancient an ancient dwarven um
landmark um landmark um it was created by your ancestors as far as you can tell um and you and
it's kind of one of those things that kind of like the the use of the rings of quorum have since
disappeared into antiquity um but uh you did see as you were passing that um it looked like there was
definitely some foot traffic and and some stuff around around there so you know there's definitely
something something was there um
um but you weren't able to ascertain what why how you just knew that there had been something that
moved through there recently um while at the sentinels rise um rush tower you did find a stop order um
um from uh the grand regent um eric silvervang um asking the watchtower to um effectively um barricade itself
and not um not respond and or um
yeah not to respond to any any messages from anybody else and to not and not to send anything
i was kind of like a red alert sort of message um that they were given
we found dead bodies at the watchtower or just we didn't find any survivors okay we did find dead bodies
um again it's kind of like one of those things where it's like you would thought that there would be
more bodies than there are but um there are definitely dead bodies that are there okay
um you informed hammergate hold uh via the sending stone that was in the watchtower
um what had happened uh and you were urged on by um captain uh ember helm to
get to get to iron hold as quickly as possible um he did inform you that the scout had returned and
there is an ogre army that is on the march um had you guys arrived even uh even half a day later um the
watchtower would have been caught unawares and you would have and you would have made it to a
a um you would have arrived to a raised watchtower in um yeah in hammergate hold as well as the raised
watchtower in sent mills rise um so you arriving when you did um saved the watchtower
okay um on your way back to the main road to get to get to iron hold um you're getting it was getting
into uh early into early night so it's not it's twilight but it's closer to night than it is to
light um you were passing by the rings of quorum or you were passing in the vicinity of the rings of
quorum i should say and you did notice that there is um a arcane light that is coming from the rings of
quorum and that is where we stopped so
um um what do you do
mm-hmm
well you definitely should check that out
we follow the light yeah go into the light like a mosquito
light like fire light or light like magic slash sunlight
you got it cool cool cool cool cool uh
and we're like close to the main road you said
yeah so in order to be able to get to the main road you have to go through this game trail that
you were you walked through to get to um the sentinels rise so you're basically just kind of
backtracking through the game trail um and that's where the rings of quorum are so they're not
like right off the road but they're boats okay now we should probably move as quietly as possible
who knows who knows what that is it sounds like some sneaking rolls and indeed it does
are we going to do uh
uh
where's that at again chris uh so in your hud um it's better to go to the hud
and then there's a stealth in there and then on sneak
all right so um as you guys um approach uh you do notice a few things um in the rings of quorum
um
one um they are there is this purplish glow that's emitting from the center of the rings of quorum
and the rings themselves have these magic runes that are etched into the rings these large magic
runes that are all light and flaring um you also know in the rings of quorum there are um as you're
approaching you're approaching from the east um there are four gates
on the cardinal directions of the ring rings of quorum so you're approaching there's one gate near where
you are approaching from um and then there are two one north one south and then one far to the west
each of those gates are glowing and emitting um a different colored um light the one that you are
closest to is emitting a red light the one to the north is emitting yellow the one to the south is
emitting green and the one to the west is emitting a white light you also do see um some pretty large
creatures um that are in the area in the center of the rings of quorum um there is a um
um there is a creature
that is dark gray and very large um it has matted fur on its shoulders and its chest as well as um as well
as a beard and um and hair uh this i'm going to need somebody to either roll a society or a survival
role to identify
very good either of those things i don't think
what were the two survival or society
i'm pretty good at survival plus 12. yeah give it a shot
unless somebody's got a better one i'm not finding that in the hud where would i look for that in the
hud do i find it in the hud uh yeah it would be it's in your skills section let's go
oh
oh there we are
oh only a 10
well um
uh jason do you have a role that you're willing to make um yeah um i definitely would like to
society society what recall knowledge um yeah
oh
oh i wrote it privately i should have done in the hud i'm sorry
no it's fine um and it's got your survival it is is fine um so uh
dem lore and hergin you both um are able to identify this thing um
dem lore you're a little bit more familiar as you as you rolled society for it um this is a is
definitely a giant um an actual giant um not an ogre not a troll an actual giant um
or again you are able to identify this as a cave giant um
um
rex
so it is in the center um and it's performing some sort of magic ritual now on each of the gates
there are also some um trolls there's a troll on each of the gates
um
um
and
those you don't have to roll for
because
it's a troll you guys know what trolls look like
um and you've got a troll on each of the gates
they are standing um right in front of them um as the ritual is taking place
um
and that's kind of what you see at this point um how do you guys wish to proceed
it's just us three right right we're not with a pack of people anymore right okay
um
sounds like they're conjuring an army like in
the marvel movies
from outer space
yeah i'm definitely
i'm a little perplexed and a little and very disappointed that they're
using
an artifact of
of ours to
do whatever abomination is they're doing that's that's very
that makes me angry
um
how big is the space chris is it like
where they can see each other really well
yeah so as far as like from the from the gate to
the center
um so from each gate you're looking at anywhere from 55 feet
uh to 30 feet from the from the gate to the center of the rings
so you guys are a little bit further back
um
obviously you haven't gotten to the point where you're able to you know
engage you're kind of you know
still
assessing the area a little bit
um but the gates to the north and south a little bit closer to the rings than the gates to the east
and west um the gates the east and west are about 50 are about 55 a little over 50 feet away
um from the center and the gates to the north and south are um about 30 feet to the center of the rings
and we can't get to the road unless we go
by this area
you can choose to bypass this if you so desire
like you can sneak you can sneak away and
get on by
so
this is by no means something that you have to deal with
what
uh shame to feel like we should
yeah not
this would be so i mean i'm like
i want to you know open an investigation here for scherzel
that's not a good idea yeah
yeah um
hey uh what are you going to be investigating
out
first question is what are they doing second question is if it's a summons what are they summoning
um
okay
yeah
that's the investigation
so the investigation is what's happening in the rings is what i'm hearing yeah okay
um
all right
uh so you guys gonna sit back and kind of watch how it goes
see what's happening
i mean
first
or a little but i don't think the idea is just to stand here and let them do whatever they're doing
yeah
if you need a little bit to figure it out that's fine
i'm gonna assess it yeah
okay
yeah all right so you guys kind of
find a find a find a perch sort of spot to assess what's happening um after a few minutes
um
um
yeah after after about a hour i guess
the ritual appears to be getting to the point of like something's happening um
and
the troll um
um
the the cave giant
and set the troll to the south that is next to the green gate
and that troll steps into the green gate
and then immediately after it steps into the green gate
um
um a
forest troll
this
tree
yes
oh
hey
um
from the
and effectively like
um
so Jason
um as you're
observing like as
an expert in elemental
energy you know this kind
of your shtick right
um
you are looking
at these trolls these trolls don't seem
to be like
healthy trolls
they seem to be like
slave or
or worse trolls
they seem to be pretty weak
as far as trolls go
they're still trolls
yeah yeah
they seem to be pretty weak but
um that troll that just came
out of the
green
uh the green
um
gate
appears to be that same
troll only all the sudden
it's empowered by
um
wood energy
um
and
and as far as what
you're looking at here
what you think
you're seeing
is it's not summoning an army
this
this
this giant isn't summoning an army
he's transforming
the army
that he's got
and making it more
powerful
we need to send an elemental
blast
and blow
that middle thing
out
of
power
all right
so
yeah
good
good point scott
um
what is your reaction
to having discovered
what's going on
my thought is
i don't know
if
i don't know
anything about the mumbo jumbo
but what i do know
is dead trolls
can't be transformed
right
there is a
very lot of logic
to that
that's my thought
or whether they can
but it takes
significantly more effort
yeah
um
you gotta make them
on dead first
i'm
right
i am
i am
wondering
if there
is
a way
to
um
disrupt the
magic
uh
in
in a way
that might be
um
somewhat painfully
explosive
um
well
this magic
appears to be
um
focused
i mean
the
the simplest solution
is
kill the magician
yeah
yes
for sure
but
as far
like
if you're
if you're
looking at
like
uh
are you
thinking
like
maybe
figuring out
a way
of
kind of
breaking
the
rings
of quorum
no
i don't
want to
do
that
i want
to
i'm
wondering
if
uh
yeah
so i guess
i'm wondering
if it's
working a
certain way
if it would
be
something that
you could
um
speak the
magic so it
does not
what it's
supposed to
so maybe
instead of
making the
thing stronger
it gets
even
weaker
or
it takes
substantial
damage
doing
you know
stepping into
it causes
it more
damage
you know
something of
that nature
yeah
um
my question
i have is
are the gates
things we care
about or can
we destroy
the gates
uh well
you you
can try
to destroy
the gates
these are
ancient
ancient
relics
so
we just
need to
kill the
people
just kill
the people
yeah i mean
you can try
like like i
said i'm i'm
not saying that
you can't do
it um
but yeah
these have
withstood the
test of
time so
you know
you got some
if you got some
big boom boom
though you might
be able to do
it i don't know
you just don't
need any red
trolls or
yellow trolls
coming out
yeah
we got fire
and we've got
yeah
any
any of the
trolls seem
bad
um
as soon
as rorick
understands
what's
happening
um i
don't
want me to
leave the
mumbo jumbo
to uh
to to my
buddy uh
demler over
there and i'm
just gonna
take my
i i
understand that
this is probably
gonna be a
fight one way
or the other
uh so i'm
gonna take my
little uh
potion of
bane oil out
and we're gonna
bane up this
here shotgun
right
um
i don't know
if i would
know but
would i know
if trolls are
giants or not
technically
um i think
that you
probably would
know that they
are of the
giant type
yeah yeah
okay
makes sense
sick
and we are
going to
bane this
sucker up
with giant
bane
right
um yeah
the question
is
how do i
actually do
that
can i put
that on my
weapon too
uh i think
somebody had a
bane rune
yeah i think
you just straight
up got a
bane rune
um
i have
equipment
bane is all
it says
and i'm
reading it
okay
so for
you scott
um and
technically
speaking you
have to have
somebody apply
the rune to
your weapon
but i'm not
gonna
i we we
have we have
somebody here
who's got
craft and it
takes like an
hour to transfer
a rune to a
weapon so we
can say that
you have done
that um
in the process
yeah okay
yeah
so i do
enjoy crafting
yeah exactly
um so
yeah you've
got the
bane uh
which which
weapon do you
want to have
bane on
your war
axe or
your war
hammer
uh the
axe the
smoking axe
i'll put it
on the
striking
yeah i'll put
it on the
striking
war
man i don't
care either
one
it's it's
fine whichever
one you want
um generally
you want you
would want to
put it on your
main weapon
um because that
one's well
actually either
one um
i can add it
do you want it
on the smoking
axe or do you
want it on the
war
hammer
sure
yeah
okay
all right
um
because i would be
ready to go in
once i see that
green thing come
out and the
other thing didn't
come out like
what is going on
and we need to
stop at some
level and the
three against
five does not
deter me
right
right
right
right
so we have
your smoking
axe is now
a bane
smoking axe
is it worth it
to like as how
far away are
we is it
worth it to
like check
tracks as we
go in closer
and look for
other pitfalls
you can get
you guys can
try and position
yourselves to
get get a little
bit closer
um you can
check for tracks
if you want
to um
see if there's
anything that's
that's patrolling
around the area
um well actually
let let me let
me let me just
give you this
scott you do
check for tracks
and see if
there's anything
patrolling in the
area you don't
find any you
don't find
anything um
that specifically
um you don't
find any any
fresh enough
tracks to be
um to be
anything
anything else
right
yep so as
you approach
you get
you're you're
approaching from
the from the
east so you're
you're gonna be
coming up to
the red gate
first um
so about how
much about how
close do you
want to get
before um
um before
you well
actually let's
just i've got
your sneak
rolls i know
where you're at
um yeah
i'm gonna get
close
and i'm
assuming that
you guys
are um
just moving
into attack
right
yeah
yeah
ultimately i
think that's
the strategy
oh
all right
pull you in
i am
i'm going to
devise the
stratagem
yes you are
yeah
yeah
it's gonna
be an
attack
stratagem
just for
chuckles
it's pretty
cool
not that it's
gonna help
me i think
what
might
um all
right so
everybody go
ahead and
roll
your um
all your
initiative
um as you
guys you guys
get to about
where you want
about like
you know
a move
away from
getting to
the troll
in front of
the red
um
the red
uh
gate
when
all of a
sudden
both that
troll and
the cave
giant look
directly at
you as
hurrican steps
on a twig
and
and
identifies
and and
identifies
you guys
as um
as
present
um
i think it's
sick ramsay
that you
rolled a
five and
you still
got
right
yeah
yeah
yeah
dexterity's
up there
huh
he's a
shooty guy
yeah
yeah
yeah
that even
okay
just plus
one d6
i just have
to remember
that
all right
um
so
let's
see
um
i have an
unallocated
language that
i'm supposed
to have
chosen
so you
guys at
this point
you can
choose to
use your
um
sneaks
as your
initiative
or your
role of
initiative
i
oh
oh
what we
rolled for
sneak earlier
you mean
yeah
the hidden
one
i will
probably
take
that
it is
likely
better
than
uh
than
this
i'm trying
to keep
my
okay
just want
to see
okay
that's
that
this
would i
have any
inclination
as to
what
these
um
okay
it does
13
the
the
white
the yellow
and the
the red
would be
um
you're
you're
pretty confident
that there are
connections to
the elemental
planes
yes
what
elements
is what i'm
uh
red would
be fire
green is
wood
yes
yellow is
earth
and white
is
um
is
water
or
yeah
water
okay
okay
all right
let's uh
begin
shall we
shall we
i don't
know
we
shall
all right
berg oddly
enough
your sneak
roll was the
exact same as
your initiative
roll so
that's
funny
uh
i didn't have
to do a
dang thing
i see i
see i
see
all right
so hergan
um
question
would it
behoove
me to
wait for
them to
come to
me before
i
hit them
or probably
not
it depends
um
i mean
if you wait
for them to
come to
you you get
an extra
action but
at the same
time you
might be
waiting a
long
wait
right
i don't even
know if i can
get to this
guy though is
what i'm
saying so
if i hunt
prey
you're
you're 25
your way
20
gets me
to
there
so that's
one action
and then my
third action i
can hit him
yeah well and
you could have
hunted prey
earlier too
this was not
a surprise
for you
okay
because i do
that
you don't have
to wait till
combat starts to
hunt prey
you cannot
prey immediately
okay so
let's just say
i did that
and so i'm
on my second
action then
right
all right
attack
oh
all right so
you have one
hit
with your
warhammer
all right
let's do
some damage
all right so
you run up to
the uh you run
up to the troll
that's in front of
the red gate
swing with both
your warhammer
and your axe
your your axe
swings wide
um ricocheting
off of the
hide of the
of the troll
but your warhammer
strikes true
dealing 18
points of damage
18 points of damage
um if i want to
hit again
yeah on my
thing i do the
map minus five
or do i have it
set up to where
it's less than
that i thought i
had some weird
thing uh well
if you do a
second twin
takedown um
it it should
should automatically
do that right
yeah it should
automatically figure
it out as part of
that macro
okay cool
so just do the
map minus five
big money big
money
do you
with both
of them
that's what it
said
right
and did you
use your
bane on
there
i thought you
already put that
on there i'm
sorry
i did put it on
there but yeah i
think it's something
that you have to
turn on and off
or like rolling
damage
it's on the
smoking axe
yeah
sophisticated
enough
what bane
is
is that the
game or is
that lucian
i'm gonna have
to
i can
in my
sheet
say where
the bane
but that's
about it
i don't see
anything else
on the
damage codes
or anything
yeah
on your
sheet
you
can
but just
under my
equipment
that bane
thing i can
just like
choose to
wear it
but
it just says
change
carry type
to warn
i don't
know that
that does
anything
and in the
damage for
that smoking
axe there's
nothing that
says
bane on
it that i
could see
in any
drop downs
well then
um
we'll just
apply this
damage here
um
and
uh
then
roll a
d6
i was
only
thinking
on the
second
one
right
i guess
i don't
understand
i mean
can roll
a d6
but
yeah
just roll
just uh
roll
a
a d6
and i
will
remove
that
from the
troll
there you
go
what
is
going
on
i
don't
i'm
lord just
devised a
stratagem
yeah i was
devising a
stratagem
excellent
oh i was
like think
think what
what
i'm just
clicking
buttons
over here
this is
doing his
own thing
sorry
we're trying
to read
stuff and
all right
see it out
demlor you
are damage
you are up
yeah no you
you wrecked
this thing
oh yeah
you're dead
oh um
so yeah
you're
you're um
you're
baned
fire axe
just
sliced
through
the
thing
um
very
effectively
and
and you
also
tenderized
the meat
with your
warhammer
so
regular
regular
sous chef
over here
all right
demlor
what are you
gonna do
all right
so
all right
devising
stratagem
was applied
i don't know
what that's
gonna do
but it's
it's doing
it yay
um
i
am going
to
move
myself
i think
generally
here
okay
um
you have
a 30
foot speed
i don't
know what
i got
is that
to
it's not
saying on
that page
20 foot
land speed
oh 20
feet
never mind
i'm not
going 30
feet then
um i will
just go
20 feet
okay
20 feet
to something
like that
all right
i'm gonna
so i move
myself there
i am
then
looking
at
oh
nope
but you
ah
nope
not that
one
sorry
okay
oh
yes
it was
this
one
i'm
going to
do
the
magnetic
pinions
the
impulse
attack
so
that
will
allow
me
to
target
three
characters
within
60
feet
so
i'm
hoping
that
i
have
positioned
myself
within
60
feet
of
all
nasties
i can't
see
you are
indeed
within
60
feet
of
all
of
those
three
at
least
all
right
yeah
those
three
there
um
and
then
i am
targeting
multiples
i do
that
by
clicking
on
you
and
then
is
it
alt
shift
shift
all
right
we're
doing
that
and
then
impulse
attack
i do
not
need
to
do
i
um
with
the
mountain
stratagem
do
i
add
the
plus
one
circumstance
bonus
to
that
for
these
guys
being
giant
it
should
be
in
the
in
the
in
automatically
applied
but
if it
isn't
if it
isn't
then just
go ahead
and turn
turn it
on
on
gate
attenuator
item
okay
i'm not
seeing
anything
about
that
it's
when you
when you
apply your
attack
or when
you're
when you
have the
little
attack
dialogue
there's a
toggle that
says mountain
stratagem
that you can
toggle on
and off
it should
automatically
be toggled
on
but if

i'm
not

about
in

open
on
your
um

troll
or both
the trolls
you did
not hit
the cave
giant
hmm
he's a
little ways
away
all right
um
and then

to the
magnetic
pinions

and then
you can
add
um
you can
add in
a
plus
one
um
circumstance
um
piercing
um
damage
to that
role
um
and then
roll
it
so
i'm
going to
do a
modifier
yep
do a
modifier
yeah
plus
one
circumstance
and then
you want
to turn
that
into
a
piercing
yeah
it's
not
an
acid
right
and add
that
then
roll
it
and
i did
it
i clicked
all the
buttons
it's
it's
sometimes
this stuff
be
be
be
kind
of
crazy
so
all right
so you
hit
the
troll
and
the
other
troll
i barely
heard it
guys
how do
you want
to have
killed
the
uh
red
troll
um
i'm
seeing
i'm
seeing
kind of
like
uh
like
um
hella
from
uh
what is
it
thor
you know
he just
stands there
he just
like
raises
both
arms
and like
spikes
spike
shoots
out
the
ground
impales
both
of
them
this
happens
to be
that
once
the
uh
the
little
trail
up
here
is
impaled
he
kind
of
slumps
over
on
the
uh
the
spiky
the
metal
spiky
nice
all right
so
basically
you find
the
metal
in
the
ground
and
you
have
it
erupt
as
metal
pinions
to
attack
all
three
of
the
um
all
three
of
the
opponents
the
giant
and
the
two
trolls
the
troll
that
hergan
was
was
just
laid
into
um
gets
pierced
through
the
chest
and
then
slumps
down
on
the
on
the
spikes
that
you
just
created
um
the
forest
troll
um
leaps
out
of
the
way
as
the
spikes
come
in
to
pierce
it
but
it
but
um
it
does
get
a few
it
does
get
it
isn't
able
to
avoid
all
of
the
spikes
that
come
out
um
and
the
cave
giant
uh
the
spikes
come
and
hit
it
but
the
spikes
aren't
um
they're not
strong
enough
to be
able
to
pierce
its
hide
um
just
yet
good
to
know
jason
jason
i'ma
i'ma
i'ma let
this i'ma
i'ma let
this one
go but
um
it did
just occur
to me
that you
did a
three action
task
followed
by a
preceded
by a
move
that was
a three
action
i thought
that was
a two
oh
magnetic
pinions
is a
three
action
task
oh
dude
i'm
sorry
that's
okay
all right
i'm not
gonna make
you go
back and
rework it
because
and
we'll
just
keep
things
going
but
i just
realized
i was
like
wait
a
minute
i
must
have
looked
at
the
wrong
i must
have
looked
at
the
wrong
thing
it's
it's
perfectly
fine
man
and
i'm
only
bringing
it up
just so
just
just
so
we
don't
make
a
habit
out
of
it
and
i
definitely
don't
feel bad
about
or
anything
so
these
things
happen
okay
well
that's
good
to
know
thanks
all
right
cool
thanks
man
um
the
uh
next
thing
that
one
of
the
trolls
standing
by
the
troll
standing
next
to
the
furthest
left
thing
is
whole
is
holding
its
action
um
and
the
cave
giant
continues
the
ritual
seriously
that
wasn't
wildly
distracting
oh
it
was
but
he's
he's
focused
yes
um
he
continues
making
gestures
and
um
and
pointing
to
different
runes
on
on
the
uh
on
the
rings
themselves
um
and
he
does
point
at
the
um
point
at
the
uh
troll
to
the
far
uh
west
and
that
troll
immediately
reacts
by
stepping
into
the
portal
don't
like
that
all right
so that
one's
gone
for
now
for
now
yeah
um
sick
sick
sick
sick
uh
well
um
we started
this by
being
spotted
right
yes
okay
i'm
gonna
move
somewhere
not
30
okay
they're
there
um
i guess
yeah
come on
i don't
think it
matters
too much
let's
move
come
oh
i'm
on
ha
ha
i'm
measuring
that's
why
measure
move
all right
uh
this one
up here
is dead
right
correct
sick
cool
we'll
move up
here
uh
for action
one
uh
action
two
we're gonna
try to
hide
again
because
i like
to be
hidden
especially
on my
first
shot
um
i
unfortunately
won't get
to reload
because i'm
already loaded
but
i'm getting
one shot
this turn
no matter
what
so
uh
we
will
try
to
hide
bam
uh
and
then
they're
both
a range
increment
away
so i
think
what i'm
gonna do
instead of
trying to
take the
cave giant
because i
feel like
that's gonna
be much
more
difficult
uh
i'm going
to shoot
the
north
troll
all right
so
um
got my
boom stick
i got it
loaded with
the fire
ammo
like you
do
um
this does
have the
correct
um
thing on
it
um
i don't
know if
i hid
from it
or not
um
16
yep
minus
two
yep
okay
that's
all
correct
um
blame
oh
oh
that's
funny
it is
a hit
however
uh
hits
are not
good
enough
for our
first
shot
uh
we're
looking for
that
that's
what we're
looking for
okay
uh
this is
what i
do
i i
crit on
my first
attack
because i
really need
to
all right
cool
i got the
one shot
one kill
uh
precision
um
the
bane
is not
in here
so we
will say
it is
1d6
sonic
because of
the thunder
boom boom
so we'll
add that
all right
and then
all the
fire damage
from the
thing is
there
yeah
cool
uh
roll it
oh
right
um
so
we need to
do a
fortitude
save
right
uh
yes
yes
yes
yes
should be
no
oh
that's a
success
yeah
yep
yep
it was
relatively
close
it was
dc21
okay
well
though he
didn't
even though he
did succeed
on the fortitude
save
you
didn't one
shot one
kill him
but you
yeah
yeah
close
yep
that is
all right
we will
take it
all right
that's all
me
that's three
all right
um
i'm gonna
roll
a d6
here real
quick
uh
to
give
a
hero
point
to
brick
oddly
enough
you just
spent it
so
congratulations
excellent
it just
happened to
be the
random
selection
too
so
excellent
i'll do
it again
there you
go
all right
yeah
it's me
okay
cool
um
this
uh
this troll
is again
holding his
action
and as
his
um
as
his
as he
his turn
creates
or
happens
um
oddly
enough
he does
still
regain
hit points
virk
fire
not
turn
that
off
in
this
one
let's
see
here
i'm not
at all
familiar with
pathfinder
trolls
no
no
no
absolutely
actually
i think
he was
weak to
it though
which
was in
the
damage
calcs
yep
he should
have his
regeneration
turned off
so i don't
know why
oh he's
perfectly
fine
i'm just
gonna
back
where it
was
are you
ready
you don't
look it
oh you
don't look
like you're
in bed
okay so
it is the
forest
troll
who is
just a
minute
forest
troll is
still
regenerating
he just
got hit
with
needles
i did
pointy
ones
yeah
i'm sure
he thought
it was
fun
all right
so he's
going to
bound
up
demlor
target
him
don't
like that
no it's
not gonna
go well
but it's
all right
it's all
right
just give
someone uh
in range for
her going to
go get
that's right
right
right and
he is
going to
right
who wants
to bite
me
that almost
landed on
17 he's
gonna try
yeah
nice
he missed
once
that's
by one
one point
fantastic
i know
right
i only
get lucky
all right
many times
unfortunately
it took him
two actions
to get to
demlor so
he only had
the one
attack so
you have
been spared
i was
spared
hmm
which one's
in the
portal now
chris
uh
well
what's
one
best one
the white
the whitey
hmm
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
the white
one which
actually
at this
very moment
in time
reappears
steps out
hmm
cross troll
i'm not
excited
and you
see that
step out
nice
maybe he's
maybe he's
extra weak
to fire
yeah
maybe
maybe
i would
assume so
um
that was a
pretty picture
somehow i
clicked off
from it
now it's
gone
don't seem
to be able
to get it
back
the nice
thing is
we're a
very long
way from
him
yeah
he's
he's gonna
have a
little bit
of a
track
here
yeah
yeah
that's
all right
because this
other guy's
not feeling
good
hopefully
hergan can
finish him
off real
quick
or not
hergan but
rurik
maybe rurik
can
stay
worried
then
i am
disappointed
that he
has
fully
recovered
and that's
it is
sad
he's
gonna
nope
he's
healed
for 20
points of
damage
good
night
he's
gonna
fling
a
hatchet
oh
that's
exciting
he's
not
gonna
fling
a
hatchet
at
demlor
he's
out
of
range
he's
just
gonna
stay
where
he's
at
and
look
very
menacing
he's
doing
a good
job
of
that
rurikin
you're
up
booyah
can't
flank
him
can't
flank
him
i guess
not
chris did
i do
something
wrong
with the
thing
before
with the
dane
or dune
or whatever
it's
called
um
bane
bane
i just
don't
know
how
to
turn
bane
on
for
specific
things
okay
i've got
it
on
the
oh
oh
missing
oh
maybe
um
it's
either
an
ultrasound
or an
echocardiogram
as we
just
look
at
this
called
but
either
way
sometimes
it's
on your
fingers
so it
might
not
be a
bad
idea
to
take
it
off
and
that's
the
warhammer
didn't
have
the
bane
on
anyway
so
that's
fine
yeah
okay
yeah
that was
a good
idea
all right
so you
do 17
points of
damage to
the forest
troll
do some
meats
and then
i'm gonna
do some
cheeses
here
roll
the
beautiful
bean
footage
damage
if we're
gonna
make
it
oh
you're
kidding
me
oh
i'm gonna
re-roll
with the
hero point
but i can
only re-roll
one or
can i re-roll
the whole
thing
just the
one
so probably
re-roll
your axe
not your
warhammer
i would
down
130
that's a
hit
so when
you're doing
damage
for that
let's go
ahead and
when you
are looking
at the
damage
roll
dialogue
add a
underneath
the smoking
axe thing
add the
add one
like you can
just type in
bane where it
says label
and then change
the d4 to
a d6
and then
change acid
to
um
change acid
to splashing
and then add
that and that'll
that'll do your
vein for you
okay
bane
let's see
not bad
that's me
i think
this was
one of the
appointments
that you
might be able
to heal
though
whoa
32
he got
fired
yeah
because you
hit him
with fire
which
turns off
his healing
fireball
fireball
so
seven
and
a lot
of 30
that's
that's
some
he's seen
better days
all right
so
i use
my
kinetic
aura
so that's
an action
right
right
and then
i can do
a two
action
elemental
blast
yes
you can
do a
melee
elemental
blast
which will
give you
a little
bit of extra
damage on
that too
i'm gonna
i'm gonna do
that
melee
elemental
blast
i think
that's
anyway
that's what
i'm planning
to do
you can
well
you could
do a
you could
do a
what
what do
you call
it
electric
well
you could
do that
too
i was
thinking
your
investigator
stratagem
oh
stratagem
that
costs
an
action
yeah
but
it
if you
hit
with it
you choose
to use
it
it
no
that's
only for
strikes
that's
not for
elemental
blast
shoot
okay
yeah
just do
your
just do
your
elemental
blast
attack
nothing
gets added
to it
hey
i didn't
roll a
one
or five
you did
miss
by one
you
wish to
like you're
a point
how do
i
you
right click
on the
elemental
blast
oh gosh
how do they
make me do
all these
crazy things
it could
just be a
button
there
it is
you just
have to
right click
first
it's just
a button
that i
can't
see
all right
i'll do
it
that's
sick
all right
so then
here is
where i
would add
the mountain
stratagem
bonus to
it right
right
so if
you look
at it
there is
a mountain
stratagem
like if
you look
at your
damage
roll
there's a
mountain
strategy
toggle
that's
toggled
off
or it
might be
toggled
on just
make sure
that's
toggled
on
so when
i click
on the
critical
right
it's
going to
open
the
window
and
then i
will
toggle
critical
blast
is
on
okay
okay
yeah
okay
okay
it is
actually in
there this
time
mountain
strategy
look at
that
that's
cute
of them
yeah
the worst
rolls i've
ever done
no these
are
pretty dang
good
pretty
damage
for one
attack
is that
what that
is
yes
that's
pretty
good
that's
the best
i've
ever done
oh my
gosh
yep
plus
for one
resourceless
attack
leading
right
mm-hmm
doing just
fine
yeah
all right
so the
cave giant
as it
continues
his ritual
um
points at
the chained
drained
troll
the north
clearly
we are
not
a threat
into
he has
a task
in hand
so
he can't
just interrupt
a ritual
and he
just decide
he's not
gonna
he'll
he's not
gonna finish
it
um
so
yeah
so the
uh
the troll
steps into
the gate
wait you got
money for
tomorrow
hard in
the light
berk you're
up
okay
all right
well
well
i suppose
sadly
he's not
visible
right now
is he
oh
he is
gone
that's
unfortunate
well
get full
strength
up
one
need to
move
step
okay
i can't
get close
enough
that's
fine
step
two
i'm
gonna
hide
behind
the
like
the
rune
circle
here
and
reload
so
we
do
that
and
hopefully
hide
from
the
cave
giant
because
that's
gonna
be
my
target
i'm
gonna
reload
another
i don't
want to
waste
the
fire
i don't
know
if
this
giant
is
fire
or
not
maybe
i will
load
sure
let's
try it
i'm
going to
load
a
well i
don't know
how that
works
we're just
gonna go
fire
it's
fine
or
cold
sure
let's
shoot him
with some
cold
that sounds
like fun
um
we'll shoot
him with a
cold shot
final answer
um
excellent
and then
we will
uh
shoot him
we'll like
come around
so we
put our
back up
against the
thing
reload real
quick while
hiding
and then
like peek
out
these rings
are like
moving
right
yeah
yeah
yeah
so kind
of
aim up
wait for
the shot
you know
breathe
squeeze
and
bam
hopefully
that was
weird
my treadmill
uh
stopped
at that
exact moment
and that
was very
strange
uh
because it
stops after
a certain
amount of
time
anyway
uh
we fire
okay
so you
were not
able to
hide from
it so it
does still
see you
yeah
no worries
oh
uh
that's
pretty good
though
that's
very
quite
good
it's
good
all right
um
yep
let's
get
the
1d6
sonic
in there
as
bane
and
boom
nice
rolled
rolled a
little better
that time
some good
rolling
who did
you shoot
oh
the cave
giant
the big
one in
the middle
shoot him
already
yeah
it's
it's
time
he's
coming
for
us
rituals
done
yeah
yeah
well i
was just
saying did
you shoot
him
it was
the troll
that you
shot last
time
yeah i
shot the
troll that's
up north
that is now
in the portal
and gone
or else i
would have shot
him again
yeah yeah
but i
could not
all right
so you
let your
let your
breath
out
yeah
cave
troll
catches
your
catches
your
eye
and as
you're
and as
you're
firing
like
it
it
swats
at the
it swats
at the
at the
bullet
but
isn't
able to
glance it
away
enough
yeah
it does
it does
cause the
the bullet
to move
and so it
doesn't hit
exactly where
you were
aiming
but
still does
hit
it still
does hit
um
and the
frost around
the bullet
just starts
erupting from
the bullet
wound
noise
and he
you have
his attention
excellent
perfect
just
all right
uh
that's me
that's all
i got
um
chris
real quick
yes
um
i have
a feat
that is
like
um
what is
it called
strategy
humbling
teamwork
um
is that
it doesn't
say
in the
description
anywhere
if it
is a
an action
requires
an action
or
it just
says that
i
i can
tumble
um
through an
allied space
tumble through
as an action
so tumble
through as an
action
yeah
okay
it is an
action
well okay
tumble through
as an action
okay
the feat
of that
is that
it allows
the free
action to
the ally
and
yeah
yeah
allows us
to flank
it
yep
oh yeah
so
okay
when you
successfully
tumble through
an enemy's
space
an ally who's
adjacent to
the enemy
can step
as a reaction
so they
can take
a five
foot step
as a reaction
so if you
wanted to
attempt to
tumble through
the forest
troll
it could give
her again the
opportunity to
reposition himself
by five feet
in order to be
able to be in a
better flanking
position
that's what
that means
that's pretty
nice
it is pretty
cool
for sure
yes
uh
and now
the uh
move
uh
a
the troll
that walked
into the
yellow
cavern
has come
out
um
and
this is
what he
looks like
now
well that
is not
what i
expected
hmm
yeah
i don't
even know
what that
is
oh it's
earth troll
i understand
i was
expecting
pikachu
troll
i don't know
what that
is
but okay
electric
troll
yeah
yeah
he was
yeah
be a sweet
band name
the electric
trolls
huh
all right
so this
troll
basically
takes a
yeah
this troll
um
picks up
a rock
hmm
i don't like
that
wow
i mean
that's not
surprising
looks directly
at um
the guy
who just
like shot
the heck
out of
it
before it
became
said
guy
and
and he's
going to
lava rock
at you
hmm
hmm
don't like
this
oh he sure
is
and uh
yeah
so
so he
flings his
rock
he comes
shooting
like a
bullet
from uh
from him
all the way
where you are
which is
way further
than
anybody
has any
right to
be
lovin
rocks
um
dealing
17
points of
damage
to you
um
that
hurts
uh
is he
damaged
from his
previous
escapades
does not
look like
he is
not
he's
fully
restored
um
awesome
all right
um
and he's
gonna
he's just
gonna
machine gun
rocks at
you
so
sure
second
yeah
get wrecked
miss
and then
the third
one
oh are
you kidding
me
well
it
or
17
more
points
of
damage
excellent
and he's
gonna keep
his position
uh
oh
that's
surprising
oh yeah
he's throwing
rocks
he'll have to
go anywhere
to throw
rocks
apparently
not
right
he's
going
to
i was
regenerative
was off
it's not
there you
go
oh
that's how
i'm gonna
do it
i'm just
gonna reverse
it when
it comes
up
well
yeah
that makes
sense
okay
so he's
going to
forget
her again
so he
looks at
her again
and
starts
you know
just
effectively
doing like
a haymaker
with his
claws
so he's
just gonna
try and
get you
with
with two
of his
claws
first
attack
miss
close
sorry
chris
oh
miss
can i
kick
him
in
the
junk
while
he
misses
that's
what i
see
uh-oh
he's doing
a furious
flailing
no
nothing
um
and he's
gonna try
and bite
you
no idea
what that
means
oh
miss
oh
wow
oh man
you know
guys
this is
supposed to
be really
tough
maybe the
maybe the
maybe the
cavern troll
will uh
um
will save
me here
um
yeah i
wouldn't call
this an
easy fight
nope nope
i've only i've
only hit one
of you
i hit you
twice but i've
only hit one
of you
oh
well it took
away half of
his life
right yeah
it's true
i mean
i was also
effectively
hasn't even
hit
yeah yeah
yeah
and i was
also effectively
stunned for a
turn so
we're not
doing super
great
um
that's a good
point
that's a good
point
cross giant
cross giant's
gonna
move up
he's gonna
troll
forest troll is
still bleeding
and he's
gonna
throw a
couple of
hatchets
all these
guys throwing
crap
right
they are as
ranged as
you are
all right
so he's
he's loving
those at
her again
oh man
oh
nice
that's good
second
and the
second
hatchet
he throws
oh
yes
all right
wasn't for
that range
penalty
all right
here we
go
that was
in Europe
roll
in the
order that
guy's dead
right so
there's no
guy after
me right
yes
so it's
basically it's
you dim
more than
the cave
giant
in
nor
is it better
is it better
for me to
hit the
guy right
in front
of me or
try to
move twice
and hit
this frost
troll once
and then
let jason
kill this
guy
um
so that's
really hard
there's no
guarantee that
i'll kill
that guy
it
the main
i think the
main problem
that you guys
are running
into right
now maybe
i'm maybe
i'm
we're simplifying
it but
rick is
um kind
out there
yeah in
front of
the the
three other
bad guys
at the same
time like
you know
one dead
bad guy is
decidedly
better than
no dead
bad guys
so
it's kind
of a
it's kind
of a mixed
bag in this
situation
i mean
if nothing
else
i could kill
this guy i
could move
in front of
rick and
right i
have an
action can
i give him
a healing
potion or
something
uh yeah
oh i mean
you can but
i wouldn't
super worry
about that
yeah i
don't think
you're ready
for it
yeah
i also often
have spare
actions uh
i haven't
these last two
turns because
i've had to
move but
now that i
don't have
to move i
will have
spare actions
and can heal
myself
so your
actions are
more precious
to do in
the boom
boom
yeah so
maybe
i'll do
the forest
troll then
see what i
can get
yeah it's
probably it's
probably best
to you know
just kind
of remove
a threat
right
big money
that one of
them was a
critical hit
pretty big
roll the
critical
decent damage
on that
as far as
the roll is
concerned
nice
see rule
four and
that's a
success
by zero
yeah
well
fortitude
has got to
be like
the strong
point
right
you did
you did
kill
it
so that's
one action
yep
i should have
some range
attacks and i
don't
that's okay
that's why
ruric doesn't
have any
you know
melee attacks
yeah but
i mean
if you have
like a
i've got a
specialty
i can't move
right now chris
and i'd like
to move
up
oh well
it would
probably help
if i made
it your turn
there you go
i was gonna
say that
frost
troll
chilling
crazy
yeah the
frost
troll
he threw
his axes
multiple times
oh yeah
yeah yeah
yeah so
now yeah
so hergan
you killed
the forest
troll now
now do
your thing
i guess i
just didn't
advance it
brook i'd
like to
move where
i'm protecting
you but
i'm thinking
that's to
your north
sure
but i don't
want to mess
i wouldn't
mess up his
shot though
would i
no
all right
um i don't
know what
else to
do
than move
you could
attempt to
let's see
here
demoralize
you could
attempt to
demoralize
the trolls
or the
cave giant
let's do
it i don't
know how to
do that
do that
though
all right
so uh
go go
down to
the basic
actions
basic action
macros which
is the
little
sorting
yep
um well
it's down
in the uh
it's down
in the macro
toolbar at
the bottom
the golden
square with a
square next to
it
oh okay
click on
that in
you look in
the second
column at
the top
there's a
demoralize
option
click on
that um
and effectively
what you're doing
here is you're
basically kind of
like um
using an
action to
um make
the uh
make the
bad guys
think that's
you know
they're in
serious danger
right now
and like i
just killed two
of your guys
but you know
what's up
you know
that kind of
thing
can i do
more than
one or
just you
just target
one
just target
one
okay
hmm
i'm gonna go
big or go
home
how would you
like to
demoralize
your targets
um
boo
what it
says
too far
away from
the cave
giant
too far
away
that's
what it
says
okay
maybe you're
too far
away from
the foster
role too
i don't
know
maybe i
gave you
bad
advice
well this
one actually
lets me do
a roll
so
after i
targeted
that one
and click
the boo
the first
one i
clicked boo
and nothing
happened
okay
i just
wonder
it lets
me roll
should i
do it
yeah
big money
big money
failure
do you
know
giant
giant
language
i don't
think
so
no
common
dwarven
and
fay
so
yeah
you
you
basically
love out
some
insults
to the
frost
troll
but he
doesn't
appear to
be phased
by your
by your
shenanigans
all right
perfect
all right
demlor
you're up
do you
have a
um
you have
a
dead
tenderized
forest troll
right in
front of
you
um
i do
all right
so
i'm gonna
take a
step to
there
and it
says that
that's perfectly
fine i guess
um
and i'm just
gonna do
the simple
you know
um
maybe we'll
try a little
electricity
on this
guy
i'm gonna
blast
elemental
blast
um
upon
um
once per
round
uh
the
and
okay it
is a
free
action
so i
don't have
to
worry about
my actions
i can
still
do
a
two
action
elemental
blast
i'm
good
devise a
stratagem
was
applied
oh
whoa
what
wait a
minute
i gotta
do that
there you
go
and
and then
i'm
here
that
i tried
oh
i didn't
try badly
you hit
i didn't
try bad
that was a
good roll
like
you know
it was a
real good
roll
it was
three uh
it was
three points
away from
my crit
yeah
it's not
bad
i don't know
how much
higher i
could have
rolled
uh
uh
okay so
anyway
um
damage
mountain
strategy is
on
i have no
strength
modifier
because
this is a
ranged attack
with lightning
uh
mom's
strategy
zone
and then
does that
or did
that that
already did
the devise
stratagem
right
yeah
yeah
okay
rolled
decent
okay
i've done
a lot
better
okay
yay
like
he's
like
oh yeah
i'll shrug
that off
all right
so
that
was
like
that was
both
attacks
right
right
okay
perfect
just making
sure i
gots it
see what
this cave
troll
giant
thing
is
oh
oh
probably
rather not
find that
out exactly
but hey
he might
have a
sarlacc
sweep
and just
take us
all out
right
we could
ramsey
hit him
pretty good
he's mad
yeah
starts charging
your direction
starts charging
your direction
give it a slow run
that's pretty fast
oh he's
fast
and he
takes out
his great axe
that
that he's
been
swinging
around
to
you know
point at
point at
people
and now
he's actually
taking it out
to
you know
awesome
damage
and he's
going to
first
target
her again
a great
sweep
of his
great axe
oh
lucky
her again
sorry
chris
a miss
but he's
going to
take another
swing
and
this time
he's going
to miss
again
um
so
you
you feel
the weight
of
the wind
blowing
by you
as this
gigantic
axe
just
swings
uh
just swings
right over
our head
and over
your head
misjudged
our height
you know
we're not
that tall
he's very
tall
all right
um
oh
my gosh
i don't
understand why
i'm having so
much trouble
with you
well
i used to
um
fighting in
big groups
for local
charities
well
um
the only
thing i'm
considering
is do
i get
out of
his way
and i
don't
i feel
like
i maybe
should
he won't
hurt you
again
so here's
what i'm
going to
attempt
to do
uh
i'm gonna
again
kind of like
we have this
one of the
rings
sort of
kind of
in between
us
i'm gonna
try to
hide behind
that again
okay
so that's
action one
uh
action two
i'm going
to sneak
uh
so i move
at half
speed
uh
does
i assume
that rounds
down
because
you know
of course
it does
yes
um
so my
25 feet
becomes 10
feet i'm
going to
sneak away
to here
which makes
me roll
another
stealth roll
um
and if
both of
those are
a success
then i am
still hidden
from him
but otherwise
i am not
okay
um
the first one
was a failure
but the second
one was a success
okay then yeah
the second one
doesn't matter
if i wasn't
hidden to
begin with
and he
watches me
sneak away
scooby-doo
style
that's fine
uh
does he have
any reactions
unfortunately
not
so
good
good
that was a
calculated
risk there
yeah
yep
this is
literally
the only
the only
enemy
in this
group
that you
could have
done that
with
so
good to
know
good to
know
all right
cool
well
uh
we blast
him
um
this time
with my
hide
we're gonna
now that i
looked it up
and i know what
it does
we're gonna
load this
lesser giant
bane ammunition
and shoot him
and shoot him
uh
so strike
roll
no
it's a hit
nine
nine
nine
twenty-five
uh
it is
uh
getting a
little
weight
in
the night
huh
all right
well
perfect
still hit
change watch
but still hit
all right
cool uh
so we have
an additional
one d6
of sonic
because of
the bane
rune
uh
plus
a
d
oh no
no that's
already
well is it
i don't see
it here
um
uh
you can just
add as an
additional
damage
yeah
oh there
it is
uh
one
d4
persistent
poison
is what
bane does
all right
cool
boom
that
that's me
that's all
three
16
points
there
more
some
persistent
poison
that's
nice
yeah
yeah
yeah
um
we just
have the
cavern trolls
turn for
this round
and i think
i'm gonna call
it um
for tonight
at this
point
because
we are
past nine
o'clock
which was
our cutoff
time
and
i don't
see this
battle
ending
like
it'll be
a few
more rounds
exactly
so
yeah
um
we'll
finish off
the round
and then
we'll
and then
we'll
go from
there
yep
thank you
no
i can
go to
915
and then
i gotta
be done
that's
fine
yeah
yeah
i yeah
i'm sorry
i'm sorry
it got
it got
over
so um
i was
trying to
pay attention
um
so the
cavern troll
is gonna
sit
where
he's at
and he's
just gonna
be
loving
rocks
and hopefully
hit the
giant
accidentally
not
likely
i don't
think i
can ever
get to
him
so
somebody
else
is gonna
have to
kill
him
so
he flings
a rock
oh my
gosh
again
this guy's
doing
damage
for
11
points
damage
he barely
is going
to
um
target
demlor
he's just
basically
just kind
of
fling
fling
fling
pretty much
um
and that's
correct
that's a
20
that's a
that's a
20
that's bad
that's
the best
roll you
can roll
well he
rolled a
he rolled
a 2
so
it's only
20 points
of damage
to demlor
only
just still
a small
amount of
damage
then he's
going to
target
ruric
with his
last
one
get out
of
here
it's
on that
one
all right
he squished
his forest
troll
all right
and that
is going
to be
the uh
that's going
to be
where we're
going to
call it
for
tonight
yep
yep
so scott
you are
you are
free and
clear
sorry we
sorry we
went over
the nine
deadline
but
no you're
good i
figured it'd
be 915
because it's
short
that's
not
