# Session Transcript
00:00.000 --> 00:25.800
So, when last we met, you had investigated the ruins of Dagger Sheath, which is a southern

00:25.800 --> 00:44.080
Dwarven settlement that is one of the frontier towns that was created by the Dwarven Kingdom

00:44.080 --> 00:55.520
in an effort to establish a new foothold in the New World after the Flaming Retribution.

00:55.800 --> 01:08.080
You discovered that it was, one, attacked, two, there were a great many Dwarves that were

01:08.080 --> 01:19.080
dead, but there were also a great many Dwarves that were not dead, but not present either.

01:19.080 --> 01:25.800
You found something to investigate, or you found that there was some

01:25.800 --> 01:35.840
movement and something happening over by the old mine that the town was built around.

01:35.840 --> 01:45.580
You went in to investigate and found two elemental rats that you dispatched, and then following

01:45.580 --> 01:55.760
those, you found two ogres and one elemental dwarf that came out of the...

01:55.800 --> 02:00.160
came out of the cave.

02:00.160 --> 02:02.440
Or not the cave, the mine.

02:02.440 --> 02:12.120
They expressed that they were looking for something, and misidentified one of you as

02:12.120 --> 02:15.220
the something they were looking for.

02:15.220 --> 02:24.980
You then fought and defeated that group, and then went to investigate inside the mines.

02:24.980 --> 02:25.780
After a little bit of time, you got to the mine.

02:25.780 --> 02:36.860
After a little bit of time, you were able to find a Dwarf that had been caught in a cave-in.

02:36.860 --> 02:52.020
That Dwarf was Captain Kael Ironmark, who was the captain of the guard of Daggersheath,

02:52.020 --> 02:54.140
who you knew by name...

02:54.140 --> 02:55.140
You knew him by name, right?

02:55.140 --> 02:55.740
Right.

02:55.740 --> 02:55.760
Right.

02:55.780 --> 02:59.800
By name and reputation.

02:59.800 --> 03:11.340
You pulled him out of the rubble, and that created some additional cave-in situation

03:11.340 --> 03:20.260
from which you rushed out and were able to get out of the mine before a total cave-in

03:20.260 --> 03:24.400
came in and crushed you all.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.740
After that...

03:25.740 --> 03:32.980
After that, we talked with Captain Kael, and he described the attack as a giant attack,

03:32.980 --> 03:40.680
which struck you as odd given that giants are supposed to be extinct.

03:40.680 --> 03:55.580
He then pointed you in the direction of the giant war camp that you then went to.

03:55.580 --> 03:55.600
He then pointed you in the direction of the giant war camp that you then went to.

03:55.600 --> 03:57.860
He stayed behind, um, as he was far too wounded to be of use.

03:57.860 --> 03:58.420
He then pointed you in the direction of the giant war camp that you then went to.

03:58.420 --> 03:59.000
He then pointed you in the direction of the giant war camp that you then went to.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.460
And you went to the war camp and saw the ogres and, um...

04:03.460 --> 04:15.680
You went to the war camp and saw the ogres and, um...

04:15.680 --> 04:16.560
...com apprentices.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.560
...com apprentices.

04:17.560 --> 04:20.220
As well as some elemental creatures walking around the camp.

04:20.220 --> 04:22.260
...com apprentices.

04:22.260 --> 04:23.480
As well as some elemental creatures walking around the camp.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.600
Um...

04:24.600 --> 04:25.560
The camp was primarily currentlyBUG, okay?

04:25.560 --> 04:27.780
handled by

04:27.780 --> 04:31.420
was primarily manned

04:31.420 --> 04:33.480
by ogres though

04:33.480 --> 04:35.460
you have not

04:35.460 --> 04:37.740
seen a giant

04:37.740 --> 04:38.420
yet

04:38.420 --> 04:41.460
and that is where we are

04:41.460 --> 04:45.080
I will go ahead

04:45.080 --> 04:47.860
and

04:47.860 --> 04:51.540
switch over to the ogre

04:51.540 --> 04:53.480
war camp so that you guys can

04:53.480 --> 04:54.260
kind of get a

04:54.260 --> 04:57.600
feel for the overall

04:57.600 --> 04:58.160
layout

04:58.160 --> 05:01.340
and try and figure out what you

05:01.340 --> 05:02.740
want to do next

05:02.740 --> 05:10.600
hey

05:10.600 --> 05:13.140
oh look at

05:13.140 --> 05:15.780
that green screen

05:15.780 --> 05:21.540
oh okay

05:21.540 --> 05:23.040
alright

05:23.040 --> 05:24.240
oh

05:24.260 --> 05:26.260
a lot of things

05:26.260 --> 05:30.480
alright

05:30.480 --> 05:32.480
so we believe

05:32.480 --> 05:34.520
the primary objective is this big

05:34.520 --> 05:35.360
tent right

05:35.360 --> 05:38.080
um you

05:38.080 --> 05:39.640
the primary

05:39.640 --> 05:42.720
the big tent

05:42.720 --> 05:44.740
is a location

05:44.740 --> 05:46.620
that caught your eye

05:46.620 --> 05:48.160
it's not the

05:48.160 --> 05:50.800
location of the dwarves

05:50.800 --> 05:52.420
the location of the dwarves

05:52.420 --> 05:53.720
is

05:54.260 --> 05:56.260
down in this cage

05:56.260 --> 05:57.260
yeah

05:57.260 --> 05:58.260
okay

05:58.260 --> 05:59.260
yeah

05:59.260 --> 06:02.260
so they're a little bit harder to get to

06:02.260 --> 06:03.260
yup

06:03.260 --> 06:04.260
mm-hmm

06:04.260 --> 06:05.260
mm-hmm

06:05.260 --> 06:06.260
um

06:06.260 --> 06:07.260
and

06:07.260 --> 06:11.260
invisibility would do for you right now huh

06:11.260 --> 06:12.260
right

06:12.260 --> 06:15.480
well it would help you get to them but would it help you uh

06:15.480 --> 06:17.480
help you get them out

06:17.480 --> 06:18.480
right

06:18.480 --> 06:19.480
that is the question

06:19.480 --> 06:22.480
so and as far as you know we're not going to get to them right now we're going to get

06:22.480 --> 06:23.480
them

06:23.480 --> 06:32.360
and as far as and as far as the uh the overall like layout like um these these little pockets

06:32.360 --> 06:40.340
of people like over here and over here these guys are kind of moving around they're not

06:40.340 --> 06:50.220
in a specific location these these are posted um these are posted you know obviously the

06:50.220 --> 06:52.480
ones that are at the ballistas are posted

06:52.480 --> 06:53.480
yeah

06:53.480 --> 06:54.480
um

06:54.480 --> 07:02.620
so anything that looks like it's moving around is moving around um and this isn't like a

07:02.620 --> 07:08.720
dead silent camp either like it's there's there's a lot of movement there's a lot of

07:08.720 --> 07:18.440
noise um as a matter of fact in the big um in the big tent um you hear what appears to

07:18.440 --> 07:21.360
be um a little bit of well appears to be the the tent uh but i don't think that's the tent

07:21.360 --> 07:22.360
that's the tent that's the tent that's the tent that's the tent that's the tent that's

07:22.360 --> 07:24.460
to be like a actual battle

07:24.460 --> 07:26.260
taking place inside there

07:26.260 --> 07:28.560
um as well as

07:28.560 --> 07:30.560
some random like arcane

07:30.560 --> 07:32.440
words being being

07:32.440 --> 07:34.060
um being

07:34.060 --> 07:36.320
said as well and

07:36.320 --> 07:38.640
even though you are not in the camp

07:38.640 --> 07:40.460
that's still something that's

07:40.460 --> 07:41.660
happening that is

07:41.660 --> 07:44.420
loud enough for you to be able to pick

07:44.420 --> 07:46.460
up just with your just with

07:46.460 --> 07:47.720
your passive

07:47.720 --> 07:49.440
your passive perception

07:49.440 --> 07:50.320
so

07:50.320 --> 07:55.240
yeah

07:55.240 --> 07:58.520
so there's a lot of action

07:58.520 --> 08:00.460
a lot of movement taking place

08:00.460 --> 08:01.840
here um

08:01.840 --> 08:03.240
yeah

08:03.240 --> 08:06.580
okay okay a lot

08:06.580 --> 08:07.160
of ogre

08:07.160 --> 08:10.400
well this is a war

08:10.400 --> 08:12.240
camp so yeah

08:12.240 --> 08:12.720
yeah

08:12.720 --> 08:13.000
yeah

08:13.000 --> 08:18.420
um as i

08:18.420 --> 08:20.240
i think i alluded as

08:20.240 --> 08:22.320
i i think i alluded to

08:22.320 --> 08:24.600
this for you scott

08:24.600 --> 08:25.380
but like

08:25.380 --> 08:27.700
there is a way

08:27.700 --> 08:30.360
um or there's

08:30.360 --> 08:32.280
there's if you just come

08:32.280 --> 08:34.380
running in here all

08:34.380 --> 08:35.340
guns a blazing

08:35.340 --> 08:38.240
there's a very

08:38.240 --> 08:40.400
good chance that you are not going to make

08:40.400 --> 08:40.860
it out

08:40.860 --> 08:43.360
but

08:43.360 --> 08:46.540
that doesn't

08:46.540 --> 08:48.500
that but you know there it's

08:48.500 --> 08:50.060
there's not a zero percent chance

08:50.240 --> 08:53.140
that you will survive i mean there's a chance you'll

08:53.140 --> 08:54.440
survive but

08:54.440 --> 08:57.580
the chances are far greater that you might uh

08:57.580 --> 08:58.840
find yourself

08:58.840 --> 09:00.960
um with the tpk if you just

09:00.960 --> 09:01.960
run in

09:01.960 --> 09:02.780
here

09:02.780 --> 09:03.820
done

09:03.820 --> 09:04.920
yeah

09:04.920 --> 09:05.800
yeah

09:05.800 --> 09:07.280
wad wretch and a

09:07.280 --> 09:08.940
something hound

09:08.940 --> 09:11.280
i do love a good

09:11.280 --> 09:13.440
you know tpk and all but

09:13.440 --> 09:18.160
we can finish this up in this session

09:18.160 --> 09:19.360
don't you worry

09:19.360 --> 09:19.960
you're right

09:20.240 --> 09:31.400
if that's the way you want to go

09:31.400 --> 09:33.760
then you are more than welcome to do so

09:33.760 --> 09:35.660
I just heard guns blazing

09:35.660 --> 09:39.300
fair enough

09:39.300 --> 09:42.100
so

09:42.100 --> 09:45.660
I am not really

09:45.660 --> 09:47.760
coming with a great

09:50.240 --> 09:53.280
it's not seeing a lot of really awesome

09:53.280 --> 09:56.140
yeah

09:56.140 --> 09:58.700
I have an idea

09:58.700 --> 10:01.320
maybe I just don't know how possible

10:01.320 --> 10:03.380
it is given the edges

10:03.380 --> 10:04.140
of this map

10:04.140 --> 10:07.400
I was hoping to

10:07.400 --> 10:08.100
create some sort of

10:08.100 --> 10:08.720
this

10:08.720 --> 10:13.200
section down here in the southeast

10:13.200 --> 10:15.180
that I'm pinging

10:15.180 --> 10:17.540
can we

10:17.540 --> 10:19.020
get there

10:19.020 --> 10:20.480
like by going around

10:20.480 --> 10:22.220
and coming into the camp from there

10:22.220 --> 10:24.140
yeah you can come in

10:24.140 --> 10:26.580
from any direction

10:26.580 --> 10:28.600
other than well I mean

10:28.600 --> 10:30.700
I guess you could come up the cliff as well

10:30.700 --> 10:32.480
but I'm not sure how

10:32.480 --> 10:34.160
I would do that but yes

10:34.160 --> 10:36.540
I mean

10:36.540 --> 10:38.180
if you could figure out a way

10:38.180 --> 10:40.720
you're welcome to try and come up

10:40.720 --> 10:42.660
the cliff as well

10:42.660 --> 10:44.520
but yeah you can make it

10:44.520 --> 10:46.720
into the camp any way you want to

10:46.720 --> 10:48.400
there's enough

10:49.020 --> 10:51.080
like you guys rolled pretty well

10:51.080 --> 10:51.880
on your stealth

10:51.880 --> 10:53.780
get around here

10:53.780 --> 10:55.020
so as long as you're not

10:55.020 --> 10:56.120
infiltrating

10:56.120 --> 10:58.500
you can you can basically

10:58.500 --> 10:59.840
kind of

10:59.840 --> 11:00.560
figure out

11:00.560 --> 11:02.640
how you want to

11:02.640 --> 11:03.560
how you want to

11:03.560 --> 11:04.640
attack

11:04.640 --> 11:05.680
sure

11:05.680 --> 11:06.820
or come in

11:06.820 --> 11:09.160
so my thought was

11:09.160 --> 11:11.140
we could come in from this side

11:11.140 --> 11:15.300
maybe scale down

11:15.300 --> 11:17.580
this little bit here

11:17.580 --> 11:18.920
I don't know how tall that is

11:18.920 --> 11:21.160
like to me

11:21.160 --> 11:23.160
the biggest problem

11:23.160 --> 11:24.440
on this whole map

11:24.440 --> 11:26.500
is this dude

11:26.500 --> 11:29.220
I guess it's about 10 foot tall

11:29.220 --> 11:30.180
probably

11:30.180 --> 11:33.560
is this dude over here with the big war horn

11:33.560 --> 11:34.800
yeah

11:34.800 --> 11:36.980
he's the one that worries me the most

11:36.980 --> 11:39.360
so maybe if we scale down here

11:39.360 --> 11:41.280
we could maybe

11:41.280 --> 11:43.360
get to like him and these guys

11:43.360 --> 11:44.920
before he blows that horn

11:44.920 --> 11:46.760
I don't know I mean

11:46.760 --> 11:48.400
or again

11:48.920 --> 11:50.540
I don't think we can come from up here

11:50.540 --> 11:52.200
like off the map

11:52.200 --> 11:53.140
I don't think we can

11:53.140 --> 11:54.780
I mean

11:54.780 --> 11:57.860
wondering if we could jump right on the cage

11:57.860 --> 11:58.580
or something

11:58.580 --> 12:02.300
I don't know about that being spotted though

12:02.300 --> 12:03.580
right like

12:03.580 --> 12:06.600
these two guys will probably see us

12:06.600 --> 12:09.080
some of these guys on the wall might see us

12:09.080 --> 12:11.700
I mean maybe

12:11.700 --> 12:12.220
maybe

12:12.220 --> 12:13.120
but

12:13.120 --> 12:16.600
um

12:16.600 --> 12:17.920
I mean

12:18.920 --> 12:21.040
it would appear to me

12:21.040 --> 12:22.440
that they're pretty

12:22.440 --> 12:24.640
I'm not sure why

12:24.640 --> 12:27.200
they seem to be guarding

12:27.200 --> 12:29.160
the south side here this cliff

12:29.160 --> 12:30.220
yeah

12:30.220 --> 12:33.200
like I don't know what the horns

12:33.200 --> 12:35.200
like why are you blowing a horn that way

12:35.200 --> 12:37.180
right right

12:37.180 --> 12:39.420
really makes me wonder what is

12:39.420 --> 12:41.360
what is

12:41.360 --> 12:41.920
over there

12:41.920 --> 12:43.240
right

12:43.240 --> 12:45.600
but they're

12:45.600 --> 12:48.760
hmm

12:48.920 --> 12:50.640
so keen on watching

12:50.640 --> 12:52.200
or

12:52.200 --> 12:53.300
alerting

12:53.300 --> 12:55.880
um

12:55.880 --> 13:00.160
this looks like an elevator of some kind here

13:00.160 --> 13:01.260
I would have to assume

13:01.260 --> 13:02.260
yeah

13:02.260 --> 13:03.320
yeah

13:03.320 --> 13:06.060
I caught my eye too

13:06.060 --> 13:09.240
but I don't know how we could use that

13:09.240 --> 13:12.240
yeah I don't know that that's going to be anything to our advantage

13:12.240 --> 13:13.600
uh

13:13.600 --> 13:14.480
like see the option is

13:14.480 --> 13:16.480
instead of scaling down right here

13:16.480 --> 13:18.540
we could try to sneak our way

13:18.540 --> 13:18.640
like

13:18.640 --> 13:18.840
we could try to sneak our way like

13:18.840 --> 13:18.900
we could try to sneak our way like

13:18.920 --> 13:21.640
across this plateau

13:21.640 --> 13:23.280
like around the back of it

13:23.280 --> 13:24.320
around these tents

13:24.320 --> 13:26.080
and then drop down like here

13:26.080 --> 13:29.600
but I'm not sure

13:29.600 --> 13:31.240
or Scott your point

13:31.240 --> 13:33.840
it may be actually the best to come this way

13:33.840 --> 13:35.140
um

13:35.140 --> 13:37.900
we'd almost certainly have to at least take out these two guys

13:37.900 --> 13:40.580
relatively quietly

13:40.580 --> 13:41.900
um

13:41.900 --> 13:42.560
and

13:42.560 --> 13:45.300
this guy's going to be a problem too on that turret

13:45.300 --> 13:46.340
yeah

13:46.340 --> 13:47.340
yeah

13:49.580 --> 13:50.500
unclivered

13:50.560 --> 13:51.960
and what a good Carolina

13:51.960 --> 13:53.480
well if you stay close to him

13:53.480 --> 13:54.760
he's got no line of shot

13:54.760 --> 13:55.800
and also

13:55.800 --> 13:57.500
I uh

13:57.500 --> 13:59.240
taps the shotgun

13:59.240 --> 14:01.840
I don't do a whole lot of things very quietly

14:02.220 --> 14:03.240
I can sneak around

14:03.840 --> 14:04.820
that's funny

14:04.820 --> 14:06.340
well when it comes to taking dudes out

14:06.340 --> 14:07.360
it ain't quiet

14:08.180 --> 14:09.700
you don't have a suppressor on that

14:10.140 --> 14:12.740
they don't come in this gauge

14:12.740 --> 14:14.740
they don't come in this gauge

14:14.740 --> 14:16.600
trae

14:16.600 --> 14:17.500
also

14:17.500 --> 14:17.840
um

14:17.840 --> 14:17.980
got the 10-gauge locked on you guys

14:17.980 --> 14:18.040
um I got that 10 gauge locked on you guys

14:18.040 --> 14:18.180
um I got that 10-gauge locked on you guys

14:18.180 --> 14:18.520
um I got that 10-gauge lock on you guys

14:18.520 --> 14:30.200
you guys are making your plans um you you have the primary objective of the dwarves of saving

14:30.200 --> 14:38.440
the dwarves but also you know if you want to have any uh any idea about kind of like

14:38.440 --> 14:45.660
what's happening what's gonna happen and that kind of thing like you know checking out the

14:45.660 --> 14:53.580
command tent um which is where all those loud noises and and arcane calls are coming from

14:53.580 --> 15:01.560
might also be beneficial so yeah um can we check that out without being seen you guys

15:01.560 --> 15:09.660
maybe nope back back door i mean like we can theoretically sneak around to the

15:09.660 --> 15:13.080
back side of the tent without being seen i think that's pretty feasible

15:13.080 --> 15:15.640
mm-hmm what hang on

15:15.660 --> 15:21.220
hang on hang on let's rethink it's a tent so you can get underneath the tent i'm sure

15:21.220 --> 15:29.380
yeah if we came around by the hog they're cooking a hog there i mean it's also a tent uh we can

15:29.380 --> 15:35.340
kind of clearly hear loud things from where we are here we get right up next to it i'm sure we

15:35.340 --> 15:42.700
can hear not loud things right it's just cloth or weather or whatever right there's always shadow

15:42.700 --> 15:43.220
puppets

15:45.660 --> 15:51.500
i mean not exactly what i was thinking well yes yes

15:51.500 --> 16:01.560
uh but my thought was what if we don't go quietly what if we snuck up to the big tent

16:01.560 --> 16:11.300
took a listen figured out some stuff and then uh lit it on fire uh and while that was happening

16:11.300 --> 16:15.500
we then snuck around to one of these two areas we talked about before

16:15.660 --> 16:20.380
i was trying to think of the diversion that we needed and that seems like a pretty decent one

16:20.380 --> 16:23.920
i couldn't figure out how to create a diversion i like that one though

16:23.920 --> 16:33.740
um what does my ambush tactics do for my chris in this situation

16:33.740 --> 16:42.500
says i can best figure out how to ambush foe the best methods of reacting to surprise attacks

16:42.500 --> 16:44.420
in those terrains

16:44.420 --> 16:48.060
uh what type uh is that

16:48.060 --> 16:52.520
last feature or skill feat

16:52.520 --> 17:00.360
says ambush tactics you made a study of best practices for laying ambushes

17:00.360 --> 17:02.740
and terrains you've spent time learning about

17:02.740 --> 17:10.400
what is your trains any combat training enemy rules

17:10.400 --> 17:12.840
okay

17:14.420 --> 17:20.300
any combat during which an enemy rolls stealth to determine initiative

17:20.300 --> 17:28.300
your combat during which an enemy can choose to roll initiative using the lore check as appropriate

17:28.300 --> 17:34.400
okay well as far as like mechanically from a skill feat perspective

17:34.400 --> 17:42.380
it doesn't really it doesn't provide any just straight up mechanical benefit but the fact that

17:42.380 --> 17:43.880
you have ambush tactics

17:43.880 --> 17:44.400
you can't do that

17:44.420 --> 18:12.540
um in and of itself like i feel like you i feel like that's a good enough um thing for you to be able to um kind of figure out the like so say you wanted to sneak into the tent or you wanted to you know do something like that um then i would say you can roll your ambush tactics

18:12.540 --> 18:13.540
um

18:14.420 --> 18:18.000
which would be a survival

18:18.000 --> 18:22.220
um you can roll a survival to figure out the best

18:22.220 --> 18:29.680
location to be able to like sneak into the tent or approach the tent without being seen

18:29.680 --> 18:35.600
so that you could basically get yourself into a place where like if you wanted to ambush

18:35.600 --> 18:39.660
somebody inside there you could ambush somebody inside there

18:39.660 --> 18:41.940
okay that makes sense

18:41.940 --> 18:44.380
i was kind of even thinking too like as we're getting close to the

18:44.420 --> 18:45.760
cage

18:45.760 --> 18:47.380
like just knowing

18:47.380 --> 18:51.780
how some of the orcs might react or something like that you know what i mean

18:51.780 --> 18:54.140
yeah yeah

18:54.140 --> 18:58.660
um well the yeah the ogres could like you could basically

18:58.660 --> 19:04.680
it wouldn't necessarily give you something about how they'll react but it would definitely give you

19:04.680 --> 19:07.500
you know kind of like an edge in like

19:07.500 --> 19:10.360
attacking them while they're unaware

19:10.360 --> 19:14.100
yeah okay perfect that's what i wanted to make sure of

19:14.420 --> 19:17.460
i didn't see the mechanics either but it sounded cool so

19:18.260 --> 19:20.220
no and yeah

19:20.220 --> 19:27.660
i mean it it makes sense that you would be able to do something ambushy with that skill feed so

19:27.660 --> 19:28.020
right

19:28.020 --> 19:29.220
you know

19:29.220 --> 19:31.180
camped our to coast too

19:31.180 --> 19:32.480
so

19:32.480 --> 19:35.660
the other thing um

19:35.660 --> 19:41.360
if we wanted to and wanted them to go after the big tent here uh so

19:41.360 --> 19:42.500
um

19:42.500 --> 19:42.700
so uh this is the tent you just complete the ladder and take care you'll get on 95ps and stuff like that you takedom like here are you never seen one like that in real life um sometimes you never see it as an unlisted try it before but even if you've seen it in real life it's really fantastic great big deal to see a в

19:42.700 --> 19:51.760
here uh up here on the call the northwest corner here um there's a bunch of roots and stuff

19:51.760 --> 19:56.020
kind of over this you know little fifth area um

19:56.020 --> 20:06.720
i have uh i'm i'm pretty good at climbing uh at least in my own head i am so

20:06.720 --> 20:19.480
right well i kind of think that um we could i could maybe fashion a a reasonable route uh for

20:19.480 --> 20:25.300
us to climb up and down pretty efficiently and make that climb maybe a little easier for people

20:25.300 --> 20:31.020
if we wanted to make that our entrance and exit i will like that

20:31.020 --> 20:36.460
maybe after causing the distraction we can just

20:36.720 --> 20:45.700
run south along that cliff there to to this point yeah that uh scott was pointing out

20:45.700 --> 20:53.740
i like that i like that a lot yep yeah yep yep okay maybe we have a route

20:53.740 --> 20:59.080
you think we can walk along that wall and then jump down to the top of the cage

20:59.080 --> 21:05.120
if that other or yeah it's distracted

21:05.120 --> 21:06.700
yeah

21:06.720 --> 21:16.020
yeah i'd say again kind of looking at looking at demler's um or jason's like demler's uh skill

21:16.020 --> 21:23.720
feats around um climbing and that kind of thing like he could easily kind of set something up for

21:23.720 --> 21:33.140
you guys to be able to um for you guys to be able to you know be able to drop down get get taken

21:33.140 --> 21:36.700
care of and climb back up on the ridge and run along the cliff and make that climb

21:36.720 --> 21:44.040
along the ridge while people are distracted and then drop back in um so i i i'd say that is

21:44.040 --> 21:51.060
that's perfectly fine and with the lead climber ability i think that that gives um

21:51.060 --> 22:03.260
it makes a critical fail less critical well it also makes a failure into a success

22:03.260 --> 22:06.700
so as long as they're following as long as they're following the right path they're going to be able to

22:06.720 --> 22:14.360
do it as long as rurik and himmler are following your lead like they've got the follow your lead

22:14.360 --> 22:19.920
thing going on it increases your um

22:19.920 --> 22:30.000
it it basically will in in if you critically or if you critically fail you just fail if you fail

22:30.000 --> 22:35.720
you succeed if you succeed you critically succeed okay i wasn't reading it that way so that's better

22:35.720 --> 22:36.560
than what i thought it was

22:36.560 --> 22:36.700
okay i wasn't reading it that way so that's better than what i thought it was

22:36.720 --> 22:49.040
i'm good with that my interpretation sucked well i'm like i'm i'm i'm also playing a little bit more

22:49.040 --> 22:55.720
loose with the skill feats because like the skill feats themselves are kind of lame if you just take

22:55.720 --> 23:03.820
them letter by letter of the law so uh you know situationally so um i like situationally i'm i'm

23:03.820 --> 23:06.560
giving you guys a little bit more a little bit more rope with this

23:06.560 --> 23:13.380
with the with your skill feats because if you invest like you invested two of your skill feats

23:13.380 --> 23:20.380
into climbing you should be able to help people climb better especially when one of them is

23:20.380 --> 23:29.140
basically spelunking um or not spelunking but where is it no i don't have anyway spelunking but

23:31.140 --> 23:36.400
yeah but yeah so here what's not going on in the tent though first before

23:36.400 --> 23:42.840
we start on fire yeah okay so i'm gonna ask for a couple of rolls for you guys to be able to

23:42.840 --> 23:49.060
for you guys to execute on this plan that you that you want to execute on assuming that this

23:49.060 --> 23:59.040
is what you you're you're good to move forward with this i think so yeah okay um so uh first

23:59.040 --> 24:06.300
thing um jason i want your character to make an athletics check um

24:06.400 --> 24:17.740
to cover just like climbing and that kind of stuff okay and at some point in this um

24:23.740 --> 24:33.220
athletic you're saying athletics yeah where did those go oh there it is all right climb

24:36.400 --> 24:41.500
olives and altitude scores yeah yeah yeah i wish my climbiness was leaving certified

24:43.060 --> 24:47.420
or i wish my climb was better

24:48.280 --> 24:50.400
yeah i do

24:50.720 --> 24:54.700
wish my climb was better um that is sufficient

24:55.980 --> 24:56.980
sweet

24:57.020 --> 24:57.540
um

24:57.980 --> 25:02.160
i'll want to open an investigation on this at some point

25:02.740 --> 25:05.660
okay um what is the subject of your investigation

25:05.660 --> 25:13.460
the tent and i'm listening and i'm you know we're then then that might be the that might be the

25:13.460 --> 25:20.500
hey i want to i want to further investigate this thing okay so i'm just preemptively saying hey

25:20.500 --> 25:27.260
that it's it's in my head it's in your head gotcha all right so with the 15 you are able to plot a

25:27.260 --> 25:35.420
course that you and your you and your compatriots are you're confident that you guys will be able

25:35.420 --> 25:51.040
to get you'll be able to um figure figure it out um now heron and uh rurik um i want each of you

25:51.040 --> 26:02.540
to roll an athletics and uh yeah for for climbing so go ahead and roll a climb for me as well

26:02.540 --> 26:05.400
oh my

26:05.400 --> 26:05.420
oh my

26:05.420 --> 26:10.260
okay where's climbing where are you getting the specific things

26:10.260 --> 26:20.240
um it's in the if you excellent open your open your character hud at the bottom

26:20.240 --> 26:25.740
and click on skills it's under athletics

26:29.740 --> 26:30.380
hmm

26:30.380 --> 26:35.400
you said something about making critical failures less bad jason yeah

26:35.400 --> 26:37.600
um i'm sure that's not a critical failure

26:37.600 --> 26:43.900
yeah i don't know

26:43.900 --> 26:45.600
ouch

26:45.600 --> 26:48.320
plus two does work though

26:48.320 --> 26:55.760
oh thank you scott that makes up for it yeah okay

26:55.760 --> 27:00.200
yeah all right he's climbing

27:00.200 --> 27:00.520
so

27:00.520 --> 27:04.400
okay

27:05.400 --> 27:10.360
line

27:10.360 --> 27:14.800
i pressed like ten times

27:14.800 --> 27:17.060
the other thing i chose is this

27:17.060 --> 27:19.780
um

27:19.780 --> 27:22.420
what's called r practaries

27:22.420 --> 27:25.400
and connective

27:25.400 --> 27:27.180
um

27:27.180 --> 27:31.240
good good good

27:31.240 --> 27:35.080
good good and then the other part was her in uh so i want her i want you to make a stealth role it's her again by the way her again sorry REEQIST TRIXER

27:35.080 --> 27:36.380
a character in

27:36.380 --> 27:38.140
the Lord of the Rings.

27:39.140 --> 27:41.240
Well, not in Lord of the Rings Middle Earth,

27:41.420 --> 27:42.860
but...

27:42.860 --> 27:44.620
You said you wanted a what role

27:44.620 --> 27:45.500
from Hergen?

27:46.600 --> 27:47.120
Stealth?

27:48.020 --> 27:48.540
Stealth.

27:54.080 --> 27:54.780
For your

27:54.780 --> 27:55.320
ambushing.

27:56.320 --> 27:58.240
Two 19s in a row, man.

27:58.940 --> 27:59.100
Okay.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.820
You had a plus 10 on that

28:02.820 --> 28:04.640
athletics check? That's

28:04.640 --> 28:05.380
insane.

28:06.700 --> 28:07.660
You had a plus...

28:07.660 --> 28:08.620
Yeah.

28:11.260 --> 28:12.600
You are athletic.

28:14.540 --> 28:15.060
Alright.

28:17.520 --> 28:18.120
So...

28:18.120 --> 28:20.920
Okay, and

28:20.920 --> 28:22.420
these roles are just...

28:22.420 --> 28:24.460
These are for your infiltration,

28:24.620 --> 28:26.520
so they pretty much cover the

28:26.520 --> 28:28.780
breadth of the scene.

28:28.940 --> 28:30.300
So we'll see them play out

28:30.300 --> 28:31.640
as time goes.

28:32.560 --> 28:32.960
Okay.

28:33.640 --> 28:33.960
So,

28:34.640 --> 28:36.680
you guys are

28:36.680 --> 28:38.740
able to all get

28:38.740 --> 28:40.800
to...

28:40.800 --> 28:44.180
I'll be all over here.

28:44.920 --> 28:46.720
You guys are all able to get

28:46.720 --> 28:48.660
to the bottom of the

28:48.660 --> 28:49.080
cliff.

28:54.780 --> 28:55.540
And

28:55.540 --> 28:58.980
move in

28:58.980 --> 28:59.920
towards

28:59.920 --> 29:01.500
the...

29:01.500 --> 29:03.700
move into the

29:03.700 --> 29:04.500
uh...

29:04.640 --> 29:05.280
the tents.

29:05.820 --> 29:06.120
So,

29:07.160 --> 29:08.520
feel free to move your guy around

29:08.520 --> 29:09.280
if you want to,

29:09.400 --> 29:11.340
but you have made it to the tents

29:11.340 --> 29:13.200
and are

29:13.200 --> 29:15.420
um,

29:15.580 --> 29:16.120
actively

29:16.120 --> 29:18.240
listening

29:18.240 --> 29:19.520
slash...

29:19.520 --> 29:20.100
Are you...

29:20.100 --> 29:20.680
Are you

29:20.680 --> 29:23.360
trying to get a visual

29:23.360 --> 29:24.440
or just

29:24.440 --> 29:26.060
listening at the...

29:26.060 --> 29:26.660
at the tent?

29:27.340 --> 29:27.600
Uh,

29:27.720 --> 29:28.460
step one,

29:28.640 --> 29:29.240
just listen,

29:29.360 --> 29:29.900
I think.

29:30.840 --> 29:31.140
Okay.

29:33.080 --> 29:33.640
Um...

29:33.640 --> 29:33.920
Mm-hmm.

29:34.160 --> 29:34.620
I agree.

29:35.280 --> 29:36.720
Avoiding the puppet show,

29:37.100 --> 29:38.440
I don't want them to see

29:38.440 --> 29:40.740
the puppet show.

29:41.980 --> 29:42.580
Okay.

29:43.400 --> 29:43.680
Uh,

29:43.720 --> 29:44.040
so,

29:44.220 --> 29:45.080
as you're listening,

29:45.360 --> 29:46.500
you do hear,

29:46.720 --> 29:47.860
you do hear the,

29:47.860 --> 29:49.200
the signs of battle

29:49.200 --> 29:50.260
inside.

29:51.040 --> 29:51.480
Um,

29:52.200 --> 29:52.660
after,

29:53.000 --> 29:53.900
after a few

29:53.900 --> 29:54.800
minutes,

29:54.960 --> 29:55.460
uh,

29:55.780 --> 29:56.180
you,

29:56.520 --> 29:57.380
you hear

29:57.380 --> 29:58.520
that it kind of

29:58.520 --> 29:59.980
died down a little bit

29:59.980 --> 30:01.240
and then

30:01.240 --> 30:02.680
one of the,

30:02.800 --> 30:03.120
uh,

30:03.120 --> 30:04.440
and then one voice

30:04.440 --> 30:05.780
says,

30:06.780 --> 30:10.360
time for breather.

30:14.180 --> 30:15.300
Let us

30:15.300 --> 30:17.040
check in

30:17.040 --> 30:18.080
with...

30:20.080 --> 30:21.080
Uh...

30:21.080 --> 30:23.080
Uh...

30:23.080 --> 30:25.080
Uh...

30:29.160 --> 30:30.080
Uh...

30:30.080 --> 30:31.080
Uh...

30:31.080 --> 30:32.080
Uh...

30:32.080 --> 30:33.080
Uh...

30:33.080 --> 30:34.080
Uh...

30:34.440 --> 30:37.400
And he says some name

30:37.400 --> 30:39.620
in a language

30:39.620 --> 30:40.700
that you don't quite

30:40.700 --> 30:41.440
understand.

30:42.900 --> 30:43.660
Um,

30:43.900 --> 30:45.980
and as he,

30:46.040 --> 30:47.180
and as he does,

30:47.280 --> 30:49.360
you hear large footfalls

30:49.360 --> 30:51.560
moving more towards

30:51.560 --> 30:53.560
your specific

30:53.560 --> 30:54.400
hiding spot.

30:55.240 --> 30:56.120
As you do,

30:56.380 --> 30:56.760
um,

30:56.900 --> 30:58.620
the arcane words

30:58.620 --> 30:59.860
that you recognized

30:59.860 --> 31:01.140
start to get,

31:01.340 --> 31:01.700
um,

31:03.240 --> 31:04.020
start to get,

31:04.020 --> 31:04.620
uh,

31:05.080 --> 31:05.520
louder.

31:08.440 --> 31:09.080
Um,

31:09.240 --> 31:11.100
but not louder

31:11.100 --> 31:11.840
as if the,

31:12.200 --> 31:13.180
as if something's

31:13.180 --> 31:14.120
coming closer to you.

31:14.220 --> 31:14.780
Something is,

31:15.000 --> 31:15.040
like,

31:15.520 --> 31:16.300
pretty close

31:16.300 --> 31:17.100
to where you are.

31:17.420 --> 31:17.840
Um,

31:17.880 --> 31:18.460
but it,

31:18.580 --> 31:18.920
the,

31:19.140 --> 31:19.440
it,

31:19.520 --> 31:20.080
it's just

31:20.080 --> 31:21.340
increased its volume.

31:22.480 --> 31:23.040
Um,

31:23.360 --> 31:24.600
the,

31:24.740 --> 31:25.160
uh,

31:25.260 --> 31:26.400
the first voice,

31:26.560 --> 31:27.260
the first,

31:27.600 --> 31:28.700
um,

31:29.520 --> 31:30.580
voice says,

31:30.580 --> 31:31.580
um,

31:34.020 --> 31:38.680
how goes

31:38.680 --> 31:39.600
the project?

31:40.860 --> 31:41.540
Um,

31:41.680 --> 31:42.280
then you hear

31:42.280 --> 31:43.760
a second voice,

31:44.180 --> 31:45.040
um,

31:45.520 --> 31:46.820
that

31:46.820 --> 31:49.040
is still deep,

31:49.760 --> 31:50.820
still low,

31:51.140 --> 31:53.020
but has a little bit

31:53.020 --> 31:54.020
more of a

31:54.020 --> 31:56.460
feminine tone to it.

31:57.440 --> 31:58.240
Um,

31:58.240 --> 31:59.840
a little bit softer.

32:01.360 --> 32:02.240
And it says,

32:04.020 --> 32:06.800
we are close.

32:09.060 --> 32:09.820
These

32:09.820 --> 32:11.160
stumpies

32:11.160 --> 32:14.220
are tough,

32:14.500 --> 32:15.800
but not tough enough

32:15.800 --> 32:17.360
for the deep magics.

32:21.320 --> 32:22.640
See what we,

32:22.820 --> 32:23.900
see what we've

32:23.900 --> 32:25.460
created.

32:27.140 --> 32:27.860
Um,

32:28.600 --> 32:29.900
in the first voice,

32:29.900 --> 32:32.320
kind of,

32:32.820 --> 32:33.300
is,

32:33.300 --> 32:33.620
is,

32:33.620 --> 32:34.000
is close,

32:34.020 --> 32:35.580
and it,

32:35.720 --> 32:36.680
it says,

32:37.800 --> 32:38.260
ah,

32:39.100 --> 32:40.860
yes.

32:42.740 --> 32:43.940
It not ready yet,

32:44.380 --> 32:44.860
but,

32:45.920 --> 32:49.340
if you keep trying,

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
you think soon,

32:52.760 --> 32:53.620
we will have

32:53.620 --> 32:57.300
a proper servant.

33:02.900 --> 33:03.500
Um,

33:03.740 --> 33:04.000
um,

33:04.020 --> 33:04.460
so,

33:04.460 --> 33:04.500
um,

33:04.500 --> 33:04.560
so,

33:04.560 --> 33:04.640
um,

33:04.640 --> 33:04.700
um,

33:04.700 --> 33:04.840
um,

33:04.840 --> 33:04.860
um,

33:04.860 --> 33:04.960
um,

33:04.960 --> 33:05.000
um,

33:05.000 --> 33:05.020
um,

33:05.020 --> 33:05.060
um,

33:05.060 --> 33:05.080
um,

33:05.080 --> 33:05.160
um,

33:05.160 --> 33:05.660
um,

33:05.660 --> 33:06.020
um,

33:06.020 --> 33:06.140
um,

33:06.140 --> 33:06.200
um,

33:06.200 --> 33:06.220
um,

33:06.220 --> 33:06.360
um,

33:06.360 --> 33:06.420
um,

33:06.420 --> 33:06.480
um,

33:06.480 --> 33:06.520
um,

33:06.520 --> 33:06.580
um,

33:06.580 --> 33:06.600
um,

33:06.600 --> 33:06.640
um,

33:06.640 --> 33:07.460
and,

33:07.460 --> 33:07.660
um,

33:07.660 --> 33:07.720
um,

33:07.720 --> 33:07.780
um,

33:07.780 --> 33:07.880
um,

33:07.880 --> 33:08.680
with that he,

33:08.680 --> 33:09.300
uh,

33:09.300 --> 33:10.320
with that the,

33:10.320 --> 33:12.160
the first voice

33:12.160 --> 33:13.580
gets up and says,

33:13.580 --> 33:17.080
one more bout before we,

33:17.080 --> 33:19.240
before we continue planning,

33:19.240 --> 33:20.840
and he walks away,

33:20.840 --> 33:23.140
and you hear more

33:23.140 --> 33:26.020
footfalls.

33:26.020 --> 33:26.520
That sounds

33:26.520 --> 33:27.640
like something to open

33:27.640 --> 33:31.520
an investigation on.

33:31.520 --> 33:32.140
All right.

33:32.140 --> 33:32.580
What,

33:32.580 --> 33:33.940
what specifically

33:33.940 --> 33:36.240
What are you opening an investigation on here?

33:38.700 --> 33:40.300
The deep magics.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.960
What are they trying to create?

33:45.500 --> 33:45.960
All right.

33:49.740 --> 33:50.840
Sounds good.

33:52.720 --> 33:55.660
What are the rest of you doing?

33:58.300 --> 34:01.100
I'd like to peek my head under that tent a little bit

34:01.100 --> 34:02.600
and see what they're really doing.

34:03.940 --> 34:04.520
All right.

34:07.060 --> 34:09.960
Well, the...

34:09.960 --> 34:11.440
Or do you think that gives us away?

34:11.580 --> 34:13.220
I thought I rolled pretty good on the stealth.

34:14.940 --> 34:15.840
Yeah, you did.

34:16.320 --> 34:17.440
You're pretty stealthy.

34:21.260 --> 34:25.840
You have to make an uninformed decision

34:25.840 --> 34:28.100
based on that.

34:28.620 --> 34:30.280
So if you think you did good enough,

34:30.340 --> 34:31.280
then you can peek your head.

34:31.280 --> 34:32.980
And if you don't think you did good enough,

34:33.040 --> 34:33.840
then...

34:33.940 --> 34:34.980
You shouldn't peek your head.

34:35.660 --> 34:36.140
Mm-hmm.

34:37.960 --> 34:40.160
Regardless, while you're making that decision, Scott,

34:41.880 --> 34:45.340
as Demilore,

34:45.460 --> 34:48.080
you're thinking about the deep magics.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.400
You kind of look over

34:50.400 --> 34:51.900
and you see Rurik

34:51.900 --> 34:54.560
with what appears to be

34:54.560 --> 34:56.780
like a water canteen.

34:57.420 --> 34:59.300
And he's kind of going around

34:59.300 --> 35:01.560
walking the perimeter of, you know,

35:02.120 --> 35:03.400
like this area

35:03.400 --> 35:03.920
around here.

35:03.940 --> 35:06.820
Uh, pouring out

35:06.820 --> 35:09.760
this very fine-looking powder

35:09.760 --> 35:13.780
along the, like, edges of the tent.

35:15.260 --> 35:15.860
Okay.

35:16.100 --> 35:17.160
So, like, around here?

35:18.120 --> 35:18.400
Yeah.

35:18.560 --> 35:19.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:19.220 --> 35:21.140
I've got 50 units of black powder

35:21.140 --> 35:23.260
that I use to make bullets with

35:23.260 --> 35:25.680
and we're gonna put it to some good use.

35:26.380 --> 35:27.460
Oh, buddy.

35:27.700 --> 35:28.940
Yeah, that would be...

35:29.540 --> 35:30.640
All right.

35:31.160 --> 35:32.940
So, uh...

35:33.940 --> 35:34.760
Pergin,

35:35.540 --> 35:38.120
you look in

35:38.120 --> 35:39.900
and close to you,

35:40.140 --> 35:41.240
you see

35:41.240 --> 35:44.980
a, um...

35:44.980 --> 35:46.320
a female ogre.

35:49.080 --> 35:52.560
And next to her...

35:52.560 --> 35:53.820
Oh, she's quite the looker.

35:54.420 --> 35:55.120
Uh...

35:55.120 --> 35:58.460
She's so great.

36:02.020 --> 36:03.880
Ogres and their magic.

36:03.880 --> 36:03.900
Yeah.

36:04.780 --> 36:05.660
Mm-hmm.

36:07.660 --> 36:10.220
Um, well, the thing is, like,

36:10.860 --> 36:12.900
next to her, you see...

36:14.740 --> 36:15.600
A leg.

36:16.100 --> 36:17.460
You don't see a second one.

36:17.980 --> 36:19.340
That is not what you see.

36:21.260 --> 36:22.400
We'll see it on the pant.

36:22.640 --> 36:23.580
Now there are two of them.

36:24.460 --> 36:24.700
Yeah.

36:25.640 --> 36:26.080
Yay.

36:26.520 --> 36:28.680
Um, next to her,

36:28.820 --> 36:31.440
inside a rune circle,

36:32.340 --> 36:33.740
um, you see,

36:33.740 --> 36:33.840
um...

36:33.940 --> 36:42.660
i don't really have a good picture but it's a dwarf um that appears to be chained to the center

36:42.660 --> 36:51.660
of this circle and the circle has a bunch of like runic sigils around it that are aglow

36:51.660 --> 37:01.540
and the dwarf is starting to show signs of like elemental attunement um

37:01.540 --> 37:12.940
from which you, Hurgen, you would kind of recognize this a little bit um

37:12.940 --> 37:16.540
but um

37:22.540 --> 37:29.640
uh as you've seen something similar from Demlur only this is more of a fire based

37:29.640 --> 37:31.460
um attunement where

37:31.460 --> 37:31.520
um

37:31.540 --> 37:36.220
Demlur is more metal based but it looks very very similar

37:36.220 --> 37:44.000
um then further on you see at the center of the at the center of the

37:44.000 --> 37:52.660
the the uh thing you see two additional ogres um

37:52.660 --> 37:57.820
one

38:01.540 --> 38:06.440
not like terribly like both of them look um

38:06.440 --> 38:13.520
both of them look pretty uh pretty well um

38:13.520 --> 38:20.000
pretty well armored and and um

38:20.000 --> 38:30.580
and combat ready but one of them specifically um definitely has an air of authority

38:30.580 --> 38:30.900
um

38:31.540 --> 38:38.720
over the others and he's walking around with um armor that appears to be

38:38.720 --> 38:48.780
wrought out of pieces of dwarven armor and carries a huge mace with him

38:48.780 --> 38:55.920
and he's at the center and they're both at the center um with a um what can only be described

38:55.920 --> 38:59.420
as like kind of like a cage like a UFC cage they they have the most precise gueys you

38:59.420 --> 39:00.420
can imagine the size of that cage they only have like you can find the specific type of

39:00.420 --> 39:07.620
they they have something like that from for battling um that they're not necessarily

39:07.620 --> 39:12.760
locked into but it's kind of like you know it's sectioned off and it's very clearly

39:12.760 --> 39:19.100
something that's meant for meant for battle there are there are splats of blood on the

39:19.100 --> 39:26.660
ground and that kind of thing and beyond that you see what looks to be like a um

39:26.660 --> 39:42.060
a conference table that has um that has some papers and different um documents on it as well

39:43.800 --> 39:45.940
but we only see the one dwarf

39:45.940 --> 39:49.080
you only see the one dwarf

39:49.080 --> 39:59.040
inside the tent um and this dwarf appears like in i don't know if i described it well but like the

39:59.040 --> 40:09.120
the female ogre is doing some sort of chanting which is causing these these sigils to um

40:09.120 --> 40:18.220
to react to her her chanting and that's and that's adversely affecting the dwarf it's

40:18.220 --> 40:19.060
like that's why

40:19.060 --> 40:21.060
by elemental attunement like

40:21.060 --> 40:22.780
something is

40:22.780 --> 40:25.320
imposing itself

40:25.320 --> 40:27.020
on this dwarf

40:27.020 --> 40:33.060
that is not necessary

40:33.060 --> 40:34.980
and it's very clear that this is

40:34.980 --> 40:37.060
this is dwarf captive it's not one of

40:37.060 --> 40:38.880
the one of the azers

40:38.880 --> 40:41.500
so yeah

40:41.500 --> 40:43.460
right yeah

40:43.460 --> 40:47.940
all right

40:47.940 --> 40:50.140
it says azer on my screen

40:50.140 --> 40:56.600
yes it says azer on your screen

40:56.600 --> 40:59.300
blow it up Ramsey

40:59.300 --> 41:02.760
I was thinking of saving the dwarf

41:02.760 --> 41:03.620
but

41:03.620 --> 41:07.180
there's a pretty big

41:07.180 --> 41:08.720
orc warrior in there

41:15.720 --> 41:16.280
yeah

41:16.280 --> 41:17.540
where was the

41:17.540 --> 41:17.920
table

41:17.920 --> 41:18.560
with the papers

41:18.560 --> 41:19.200
at Chris

41:19.200 --> 41:19.760
roughly

41:19.760 --> 41:21.160
it's like

41:21.160 --> 41:21.500
all right

41:21.500 --> 41:21.900
in the middle

41:21.900 --> 41:23.280
excellent

41:23.280 --> 41:24.240
good good good

41:24.240 --> 41:25.840
so it's like

41:25.840 --> 41:26.280
you've got

41:26.280 --> 41:28.040
you've got a

41:28.040 --> 41:29.320
well you've got a ring

41:29.320 --> 41:31.180
around where the circle is

41:31.180 --> 41:31.680
is

41:31.680 --> 41:33.220
in the

41:33.220 --> 41:33.780
in the tent

41:33.780 --> 41:35.120
that's where the ring is

41:35.120 --> 41:36.520
the table is

41:36.520 --> 41:36.940
it's

41:36.940 --> 41:38.460
probably not here

41:38.460 --> 41:39.200
it's it's

41:39.200 --> 41:40.300
closer to like

41:40.300 --> 41:41.040
over here

41:41.040 --> 41:41.880
yeah

41:41.880 --> 41:43.200
yeah but not by

41:43.200 --> 41:44.660
not close to

41:44.660 --> 41:45.740
the edge of the tent

41:45.740 --> 41:46.980
no

41:46.980 --> 41:47.560
okay

41:47.560 --> 41:47.900
well I would say

41:47.900 --> 41:49.280
and there are

41:49.280 --> 41:50.140
blow my head off

41:50.140 --> 41:51.140
let these people know

41:51.140 --> 41:52.480
yeah

41:52.480 --> 41:54.300
and there are

41:54.300 --> 41:55.640
a number of other things

41:55.640 --> 41:56.800
in the tent

41:56.800 --> 41:58.020
like there's an

41:58.020 --> 41:59.960
there's an ogre armory

41:59.960 --> 42:01.120
and different things

42:01.120 --> 42:01.840
that are there

42:01.840 --> 42:03.020
but really kind of

42:03.020 --> 42:03.760
the main

42:03.760 --> 42:06.440
the main attractions

42:06.440 --> 42:07.520
if you will

42:07.520 --> 42:09.240
that you guys are

42:09.240 --> 42:11.000
that have caught your eye

42:11.000 --> 42:11.580
is

42:11.580 --> 42:12.400
the

42:12.400 --> 42:13.940
war table

42:13.940 --> 42:15.280
the

42:15.280 --> 42:17.540
the battle ring

42:17.540 --> 42:17.860
the battle ring

42:17.860 --> 42:18.960
and

42:18.960 --> 42:20.100
the

42:20.100 --> 42:21.460
arcane

42:21.460 --> 42:23.320
or runic

42:23.320 --> 42:27.100
magic

42:27.100 --> 42:28.480
area

42:28.480 --> 42:29.780
over there

42:47.860 --> 42:48.860
.

42:48.860 --> 42:49.860
so

42:49.860 --> 42:50.860
um

42:50.860 --> 42:51.860
yeah and

42:51.860 --> 42:52.860
like

42:52.860 --> 42:53.860
if if you

42:53.860 --> 42:54.860
you know there

42:54.860 --> 42:55.860
there are things to

42:55.860 --> 42:56.860
hide behind

42:56.860 --> 42:57.860
there are different

42:57.860 --> 42:58.860
there like the

42:58.860 --> 42:59.860
like you can try

42:59.860 --> 43:00.860
and sneak around

43:00.860 --> 43:01.860
to the

43:01.860 --> 43:02.860
um

43:02.860 --> 43:05.200
through the table

43:05.200 --> 43:06.200
if you want to

43:06.200 --> 43:07.200
if that's kind of

43:07.200 --> 43:08.200
what you were

43:08.200 --> 43:09.200
kind of thinking

43:09.200 --> 43:10.200
um

43:10.200 --> 43:12.700
or

43:12.700 --> 43:13.700
try and come in

43:13.700 --> 43:14.700
from a different

43:14.700 --> 43:15.700
from a different location

43:15.700 --> 43:16.700
or something like that

43:16.700 --> 43:17.700
but

43:17.860 --> 43:19.860
you can be like

43:19.860 --> 43:20.860
oh that's weird

43:20.860 --> 43:21.860
leave

43:21.860 --> 43:22.860
start your fire

43:22.860 --> 43:23.860
and run

43:23.860 --> 43:24.860
yeah

43:24.860 --> 43:25.860
yeah yeah

43:25.860 --> 43:26.860
there's one advantageous

43:26.860 --> 43:27.860
point here to consider

43:27.860 --> 43:28.860
uh-huh

43:28.860 --> 43:29.860
the sounds of

43:29.860 --> 43:30.860
combat

43:30.860 --> 43:31.860
are already

43:31.860 --> 43:32.860
at play

43:32.860 --> 43:33.860
that's true

43:33.860 --> 43:34.860
nobody

43:34.860 --> 43:35.860
is

43:35.860 --> 43:36.860
there

43:36.860 --> 43:37.860
nobody

43:37.860 --> 43:38.860
is there

43:38.860 --> 43:39.860
nobody

43:39.860 --> 43:40.860
is there

43:40.860 --> 43:41.860
nobody

43:41.860 --> 43:42.860
is there

43:42.860 --> 43:43.860
nobody

43:43.860 --> 43:44.860
is there

43:44.860 --> 43:45.860
nobody

43:45.860 --> 43:46.860
nobody

43:46.860 --> 43:47.860
nobody

43:47.860 --> 43:48.860
outdoors

43:48.860 --> 43:49.860
is going to think

43:49.860 --> 43:50.860
anything

43:50.860 --> 43:51.860
different

43:51.860 --> 43:52.860
about

43:52.860 --> 43:53.860
the clang of metal

43:53.860 --> 43:54.860
and

43:54.860 --> 43:55.860
you know

43:55.860 --> 43:56.860
maybe some war cries

43:56.860 --> 43:57.860
something of that nature

43:57.860 --> 44:02.860
um

44:02.860 --> 44:03.860
that is true

44:03.860 --> 44:04.860
uh

44:04.860 --> 44:05.860
that's

44:05.860 --> 44:06.860
that's

44:06.860 --> 44:07.860
fair

44:09.860 --> 44:10.860
what about

44:10.860 --> 44:11.860
shotguns

44:13.860 --> 44:14.860
yeah

44:14.860 --> 44:15.860
only one way

44:15.860 --> 44:16.860
to find out

44:16.860 --> 44:17.860
right

44:17.860 --> 44:22.860
if you stick it

44:22.860 --> 44:23.860
right on

44:23.860 --> 44:24.860
the blubber

44:24.860 --> 44:25.860
it probably

44:25.860 --> 44:26.860
will mute

44:26.860 --> 44:27.860
this out

44:27.860 --> 44:28.860
make my own

44:28.860 --> 44:29.860
silencer

44:29.860 --> 44:30.860
right

44:30.860 --> 44:31.860
just

44:31.860 --> 44:32.860
just

44:32.860 --> 44:33.860
point blank

44:33.860 --> 44:34.860
that's all

44:34.860 --> 44:35.860
we've got

44:35.860 --> 44:36.860
here

44:36.860 --> 44:37.860
you know

44:37.860 --> 44:38.860
that one

44:38.860 --> 44:41.860
shot

44:41.860 --> 44:44.860
gosh

44:44.860 --> 44:45.860
i mean

44:45.860 --> 44:46.860
uh

44:46.860 --> 44:47.860
that's pretty

44:47.860 --> 44:48.860
ballsy

44:48.860 --> 44:49.860
stealth

44:49.860 --> 44:50.860
seems

44:50.860 --> 44:51.860
more

44:51.860 --> 44:52.860
appropriate

44:52.860 --> 44:53.860
yeah

44:53.860 --> 44:54.860
so here's

44:54.860 --> 44:55.860
my

44:55.860 --> 44:56.860
picture

44:56.860 --> 44:57.860
here's

44:57.860 --> 44:58.860
my

44:58.860 --> 44:59.860
thought

44:59.860 --> 45:00.860
on the

45:00.860 --> 45:01.860
matters

45:01.860 --> 45:04.860
um

45:04.860 --> 45:05.860
in order

45:05.860 --> 45:06.860
of

45:06.860 --> 45:07.860
importance

45:07.860 --> 45:08.860
i think

45:08.860 --> 45:09.860
uh

45:09.860 --> 45:10.860
at the

45:10.860 --> 45:11.860
very bottom

45:11.860 --> 45:12.860
of the ladder

45:12.860 --> 45:13.860
uh

45:13.860 --> 45:14.860
there is

45:14.860 --> 45:15.860
this dwarf

45:15.860 --> 45:16.860
and being

45:16.860 --> 45:17.860
transformed

45:17.860 --> 45:18.860
uh

45:18.860 --> 45:19.860
that is

45:19.860 --> 45:20.860
something i

45:20.860 --> 45:21.860
would like

45:21.860 --> 45:22.860
to stop

45:22.860 --> 45:23.860
but it is

45:23.860 --> 45:24.860
of the

45:24.860 --> 45:25.860
lowest

45:25.860 --> 45:26.860
importance

45:26.860 --> 45:27.860
uh

45:27.860 --> 45:28.860
second

45:28.860 --> 45:29.860
are all

45:29.860 --> 45:30.860
these dwarves

45:30.860 --> 45:31.860
in a cage

45:31.860 --> 45:32.860
i want

45:32.860 --> 45:33.860
to free

45:33.860 --> 45:34.860
them

45:34.860 --> 45:35.860
uh

45:35.860 --> 45:36.860
i think

45:36.860 --> 45:37.860
the papers

45:37.860 --> 45:38.860
on that

45:38.860 --> 45:39.860
table

45:39.860 --> 45:40.860
are actually

45:40.860 --> 45:41.860
the most

45:41.860 --> 45:42.860
important

45:42.860 --> 45:43.860
right

45:43.860 --> 45:44.860
like

45:44.860 --> 45:45.860
our entire

45:45.860 --> 45:46.860
settlement

45:46.860 --> 45:47.860
right

45:47.860 --> 45:48.860
yeah i don't

45:48.860 --> 45:49.860
disagree with

45:49.860 --> 45:50.860
that assessment

45:50.860 --> 45:51.860
uh

45:51.860 --> 45:52.860
yeah

45:52.860 --> 45:53.860
so

45:53.860 --> 45:54.860
hmm

45:54.860 --> 45:55.860
maybe we

45:55.860 --> 45:56.860
try

45:56.860 --> 45:57.860
more stealthy

45:57.860 --> 45:58.860
just one

45:58.860 --> 45:59.860
person

45:59.860 --> 46:00.860
yeah

46:00.860 --> 46:01.860
or maybe

oh my

47:14.860 --> 47:15.860
gosh

so

47:16.860 --> 47:17.860
so

47:17.860 --> 47:18.860
as far

47:18.860 --> 47:19.860
as i

47:19.860 --> 47:20.860
can

47:20.860 --> 47:21.860
believe

47:21.860 --> 47:22.860
that that's

47:22.860 --> 47:23.860
gotta fall

47:23.860 --> 47:24.860
under some

47:24.860 --> 47:25.860
of my

47:25.860 --> 47:26.860
um

47:26.860 --> 47:27.860
mountain

47:27.860 --> 47:28.860
strategy

47:28.860 --> 47:29.860
stuff

47:29.860 --> 47:30.860
i mean

47:30.860 --> 47:31.860
those guys

47:31.860 --> 47:32.860
are clearly

47:32.860 --> 47:33.860
giants

47:33.860 --> 47:34.860
uh

47:34.860 --> 47:35.860
yeah

47:35.860 --> 47:36.860
i mean

47:36.860 --> 47:37.860
they are

47:37.860 --> 47:38.860
most likely

47:38.860 --> 47:39.860
giant

47:39.860 --> 47:40.860
typed

47:40.860 --> 47:41.860
so

47:41.860 --> 47:42.860
oh

47:42.860 --> 47:43.860
i think

47:43.860 --> 47:44.860
i should

47:44.860 --> 47:45.860
get some

47:45.860 --> 47:46.860
bonuses

47:46.860 --> 47:47.860
to fight

47:47.860 --> 47:48.860
those guys

47:48.860 --> 47:49.860
anyway

47:49.860 --> 47:50.860
oh

47:50.860 --> 47:51.860
i didn't

47:51.860 --> 47:52.860
realize

47:52.860 --> 47:53.860
they were

47:53.860 --> 47:54.860
that big

47:54.860 --> 47:55.860
that's

47:55.860 --> 47:56.860
huge

47:56.860 --> 47:57.860
okay

47:57.860 --> 47:58.860
yeah

47:58.860 --> 47:59.860
their

47:59.860 --> 48:00.860
ogres

48:00.860 --> 48:01.860
are

48:01.860 --> 48:02.860
ogres

48:02.860 --> 48:03.860
are

48:03.860 --> 48:04.860
a type

48:04.860 --> 48:05.860
of giant

48:05.860 --> 48:06.860
they are

48:06.860 --> 48:07.860
not

48:07.860 --> 48:08.860
giants

48:08.860 --> 48:09.860
proper

48:09.860 --> 48:10.860
but they

48:10.860 --> 48:11.860
are giant

48:11.860 --> 48:14.860
um

48:14.860 --> 48:15.860
on this

48:15.860 --> 48:16.860
tent

48:16.860 --> 48:17.860
chris

48:17.860 --> 48:18.860
is

48:18.860 --> 48:19.860
the

48:19.860 --> 48:20.860
the peak

48:20.860 --> 48:21.860
of it

48:21.860 --> 48:22.860
um

48:22.860 --> 48:23.860
do they

48:23.860 --> 48:24.860
have fires

48:24.860 --> 48:25.860
in this

48:25.860 --> 48:26.860
tent

48:26.860 --> 48:27.860
is there

48:27.860 --> 48:28.860
like a

48:28.860 --> 48:29.860
exhaust

48:29.860 --> 48:30.860
hole

48:30.860 --> 48:31.860
there is

48:31.860 --> 48:32.860
at the top

48:32.860 --> 48:33.860
of the

48:33.860 --> 48:34.860
tent

48:34.860 --> 48:35.860
intriguing

48:35.860 --> 48:36.860
i like

48:36.860 --> 48:37.860
the

48:37.860 --> 48:38.860
exhaust

48:38.860 --> 48:39.860
um

48:41.860 --> 48:44.860
i don't

48:44.860 --> 48:45.860
know

48:45.860 --> 48:46.860
if

48:46.860 --> 48:47.860
uh

48:47.860 --> 48:48.860
either

48:48.860 --> 48:49.860
of you

48:49.860 --> 48:50.860
guys

48:50.860 --> 48:51.860
have

48:51.860 --> 48:52.860
seen

48:52.860 --> 48:53.860
that

48:53.860 --> 48:54.860
uh

48:54.860 --> 48:55.860
that

48:55.860 --> 48:56.860
new

48:56.860 --> 48:57.860
uh

48:57.860 --> 48:58.860
play

48:58.860 --> 48:59.860
uh

48:59.860 --> 49:00.860
called

49:00.860 --> 49:01.860
mission

49:01.860 --> 49:02.860
impossible

49:02.860 --> 49:03.860
but

49:03.860 --> 49:04.860
there's

49:04.860 --> 49:05.860
this

49:05.860 --> 49:06.860
cool

49:06.860 --> 49:07.860
scene

49:07.860 --> 49:08.860
drop

49:08.860 --> 49:10.860
down

49:10.860 --> 49:12.860
oh

49:12.860 --> 49:13.860
play

49:13.860 --> 49:14.860
yeah

49:14.860 --> 49:15.860
i remember

49:15.860 --> 49:16.860
seeing that

49:16.860 --> 49:17.860
i don't

49:17.860 --> 49:18.860
i don't

49:18.860 --> 49:19.860
think that

49:19.860 --> 49:20.860
would actually

49:20.860 --> 49:21.860
work in

49:21.860 --> 49:22.860
this case

49:22.860 --> 49:23.860
but also

49:23.860 --> 49:24.860
that top

49:24.860 --> 49:25.860
of that

49:25.860 --> 49:26.860
thing would

49:26.860 --> 49:27.860
be very

49:27.860 --> 49:28.860
very high

49:28.860 --> 49:29.860
i don't

49:29.860 --> 49:30.860
think any

49:30.860 --> 49:31.860
of us

49:31.860 --> 49:32.860
would

49:32.860 --> 49:33.860
survive

49:33.860 --> 49:34.860
the drop

49:34.860 --> 49:35.860
hmm

49:35.860 --> 49:36.860
just thinking

49:36.860 --> 49:37.860
really well

49:37.860 --> 49:38.860
oh well

49:38.860 --> 49:39.860
yeah

49:39.860 --> 49:40.860
i don't

49:40.860 --> 49:41.860
think

49:41.860 --> 49:42.860
that's

49:42.860 --> 49:43.860
a good

49:43.860 --> 49:44.860
vantage

49:44.860 --> 49:45.860
point

49:45.860 --> 49:46.860
to shoot

49:46.860 --> 49:47.860
people at

49:47.860 --> 49:48.860
though

49:48.860 --> 49:49.860
i might

49:49.860 --> 49:50.860
be able

49:50.860 --> 49:51.860
to help

49:51.860 --> 49:52.860
you climb

49:52.860 --> 49:53.860
yeah

49:53.860 --> 49:54.860
yeah

49:54.860 --> 49:55.860
yeah

49:55.860 --> 49:56.860
i don't

49:56.860 --> 49:57.860
climb so

49:57.860 --> 49:58.860
good

49:58.860 --> 49:59.860
normally

49:59.860 --> 50:00.860
i notice

50:00.860 --> 50:01.860
i can

50:01.860 --> 50:02.860
uh

50:02.860 --> 50:03.860
i can

50:03.860 --> 50:04.860
get a

50:04.860 --> 50:05.860
good

50:05.860 --> 50:06.860
boost

50:06.860 --> 50:07.860
but it's

50:07.860 --> 50:08.860
very loud

50:08.860 --> 50:09.860
uh

50:09.860 --> 50:12.860
but

50:22.860 --> 50:23.860
yeah

50:23.860 --> 50:24.860
probably

50:24.860 --> 50:25.860
i i don't

50:25.860 --> 50:26.860
know i don't

50:26.860 --> 50:27.860
know

50:27.860 --> 50:28.860
being in

50:28.860 --> 50:29.860
there

50:29.860 --> 50:30.860
he said

50:30.860 --> 50:31.860
we could

50:31.860 --> 50:32.860
hide behind

50:32.860 --> 50:33.860
and we're

50:33.860 --> 50:34.860
way smaller

50:34.860 --> 50:35.860
than them

50:35.860 --> 50:36.860
it's almost

50:36.860 --> 50:37.860
like the

50:37.860 --> 50:38.860
hobbit

50:38.860 --> 50:39.860
scenario

50:39.860 --> 50:40.860
i'm just wondering

50:40.860 --> 50:41.860
why get in

50:41.860 --> 50:42.860
and get out

50:42.860 --> 50:43.860
that's kind

50:43.860 --> 50:44.860
of what i'm

50:44.860 --> 50:45.860
thinking i

50:45.860 --> 50:46.860
don't actually

50:46.860 --> 50:47.860
like climbing

50:47.860 --> 50:48.860
the tent

50:48.860 --> 50:49.860
uh it

50:49.860 --> 50:50.860
would make

50:50.860 --> 50:51.860
getting away

50:51.860 --> 50:52.860
quite a bit

50:52.860 --> 50:53.860
more difficult

50:53.860 --> 50:54.860
um

50:54.860 --> 50:55.860
but i do

50:55.860 --> 50:56.860
like trying

50:56.860 --> 50:57.860
to sneak

50:57.860 --> 50:58.860
in there

50:58.860 --> 50:59.860
and get

50:59.860 --> 51:00.860
those papers

51:00.860 --> 51:01.860
um

51:01.860 --> 51:02.860
so having

51:02.860 --> 51:03.860
stuck your

51:03.860 --> 51:04.860
head in

51:04.860 --> 51:05.860
there

51:05.860 --> 51:06.860
bergen

51:06.860 --> 51:07.860
uh

51:07.860 --> 51:08.860
are we

51:08.860 --> 51:09.860
gonna

51:09.860 --> 51:10.860
cover

51:10.860 --> 51:11.860
when we

51:11.860 --> 51:12.860
pop that

51:12.860 --> 51:13.860
tent

51:13.860 --> 51:14.860
bottom

51:14.860 --> 51:15.860
up

51:15.860 --> 51:16.860
or

51:16.860 --> 51:17.860
or can

51:17.860 --> 51:18.860
we better

51:18.860 --> 51:19.860
position

51:19.860 --> 51:20.860
ourselves

51:20.860 --> 51:21.860
without

51:21.860 --> 51:22.860
exposing

51:22.860 --> 51:23.860
i would

51:23.860 --> 51:24.860
say we

51:24.860 --> 51:25.860
could go

51:25.860 --> 51:26.860
more

51:26.860 --> 51:27.860
north

51:27.860 --> 51:28.860
east

51:28.860 --> 51:29.860
yeah

51:29.860 --> 51:30.860
column

51:30.860 --> 51:31.860
you know

51:31.860 --> 51:32.860
yep

51:32.860 --> 51:33.860
that's kind

51:33.860 --> 51:34.860
of what i

51:34.860 --> 51:35.860
was thinking

51:35.860 --> 51:36.860
too

51:36.860 --> 51:37.860
okay do

51:37.860 --> 51:38.860
you think

51:38.860 --> 51:39.860
we can

51:39.860 --> 51:40.860
if we've

51:40.860 --> 51:41.860
got if

51:41.860 --> 51:42.860
we can

51:42.860 --> 51:43.860
climb underneath

51:43.860 --> 51:44.860
that and

51:44.860 --> 51:45.860
we're behind

51:45.860 --> 51:46.860
something already

51:46.860 --> 51:47.860
i think all

51:47.860 --> 51:48.860
three of us

51:48.860 --> 51:49.860
should go in

51:49.860 --> 51:50.860
so that we

51:50.860 --> 51:51.860
have a better

51:51.860 --> 51:52.860
response time

51:52.860 --> 51:53.860
okay sure

51:53.860 --> 51:54.860
sure but then

51:54.860 --> 51:55.860
just one person

51:55.860 --> 51:56.860
go for the

51:56.860 --> 51:57.860
letters is

51:57.860 --> 51:58.860
what i was

51:58.860 --> 51:59.860
right

51:59.860 --> 52:00.860
yes

52:00.860 --> 52:01.860
yep that'd

52:01.860 --> 52:02.860
be my plan

52:02.860 --> 52:03.860
if i had a

52:03.860 --> 52:05.860
plan

52:05.860 --> 52:06.860
all right

52:06.860 --> 52:07.860
chris what i have known

52:07.860 --> 52:08.860
yeah i poked

52:08.860 --> 52:09.860
my head

52:09.860 --> 52:10.860
under there

52:10.860 --> 52:11.860
so i could

52:11.860 --> 52:12.860
see all the

52:12.860 --> 52:13.860
stuff to

52:13.860 --> 52:14.860
where we

52:14.860 --> 52:15.860
should enter

52:15.860 --> 52:16.860
past or

52:16.860 --> 52:17.860
whatever right

52:17.860 --> 52:18.860
so yeah

52:18.860 --> 52:19.860
you can

52:19.860 --> 52:20.860
you can figure

52:20.860 --> 52:21.860
it out

52:21.860 --> 52:22.860
um i will

52:22.860 --> 52:23.860
it it i

52:23.860 --> 52:24.860
will require

52:24.860 --> 52:25.860
a fresh

52:25.860 --> 52:26.860
sneaking role

52:26.860 --> 52:27.860
here as

52:27.860 --> 52:28.860
this is kind

52:28.860 --> 52:29.860
of a

52:29.860 --> 52:30.860
a new

52:30.860 --> 52:31.860
initiative

52:31.860 --> 52:32.860
for what

52:32.860 --> 52:33.860
you're what

52:33.860 --> 52:34.860
you're trying

52:34.860 --> 52:35.860
to do

52:35.860 --> 52:36.860
so um

52:36.860 --> 52:37.860
if you

52:37.860 --> 52:38.860
leave the

52:38.860 --> 52:39.860
tent i

52:39.860 --> 52:40.860
will request

52:40.860 --> 52:41.860
a stealth

52:41.860 --> 52:42.860
oh

52:42.860 --> 52:43.860
uh do you

52:43.860 --> 52:44.860
want the

52:44.860 --> 52:45.860
actual sneak

52:45.860 --> 52:46.860
part of

52:46.860 --> 52:47.860
stealth

52:47.860 --> 52:48.860
i'm assuming

52:48.860 --> 52:49.860
yes

52:49.860 --> 52:50.860
okay

52:50.860 --> 52:51.860
all that

52:51.860 --> 52:54.860
stuff

52:54.860 --> 52:57.860
oh man

52:57.860 --> 53:00.860
gosh

53:00.860 --> 53:01.860
i rolled

53:01.860 --> 53:02.860
a number

53:02.860 --> 53:04.860
nice job

53:04.860 --> 53:05.860
mm-hmm

53:06.860 --> 53:07.860
i didn't

53:07.860 --> 53:08.860
even see

53:08.860 --> 53:09.860
your dice

53:09.860 --> 53:10.860
scott i

53:10.860 --> 53:11.860
didn't see

53:11.860 --> 53:12.860
your dice

53:12.860 --> 53:13.860
at all

53:13.860 --> 53:14.860
i don't see

53:14.860 --> 53:15.860
any of our

53:15.860 --> 53:16.860
dice

53:16.860 --> 53:17.860
well the

53:17.860 --> 53:18.860
thing takes

53:18.860 --> 53:19.860
up my whole

53:19.860 --> 53:20.860
screen so i

53:20.860 --> 53:21.860
can't even

53:21.860 --> 53:22.860
see if it

53:22.860 --> 53:23.860
works or

53:23.860 --> 53:24.860
not

53:24.860 --> 53:25.860
all right

53:25.860 --> 53:26.860
all worked

53:26.860 --> 53:27.860
no no it

53:27.860 --> 53:28.860
it did

53:28.860 --> 53:29.860
um all

53:29.860 --> 53:30.860
right we

53:30.860 --> 53:31.860
just don't

53:31.860 --> 53:32.860
get to see

53:32.860 --> 53:33.860
because that's

53:33.860 --> 53:34.860
the way the

53:34.860 --> 53:35.860
game works

53:35.860 --> 53:36.860
you guys

53:36.860 --> 53:37.860
shouldn't

53:37.860 --> 53:38.860
actually

53:38.860 --> 53:39.860
know how

53:39.860 --> 53:40.860
well you

53:40.860 --> 53:41.860
snuck

53:41.860 --> 53:42.860
it's

53:42.860 --> 53:43.860
according to

53:43.860 --> 53:44.860
the game

53:44.860 --> 53:45.860
so

53:45.860 --> 53:46.860
that's

53:46.860 --> 53:47.860
why

53:47.860 --> 53:48.860
you don't

53:48.860 --> 53:49.860
see the

53:49.860 --> 53:50.860
results

53:50.860 --> 53:51.860
okay so

53:51.860 --> 53:52.860
you guys

53:52.860 --> 53:53.860
all pop

53:53.860 --> 53:54.860
into

53:54.860 --> 53:55.860
the

53:55.860 --> 53:56.860
um

53:56.860 --> 53:57.860
guys i'll

53:57.860 --> 53:58.860
pop into

53:58.860 --> 53:59.860
the

53:59.860 --> 54:00.860
uh tent

54:00.860 --> 54:01.860
uh behind

54:01.860 --> 54:02.860
a large

54:02.860 --> 54:03.860
um

54:03.860 --> 54:04.860
weapon

54:04.860 --> 54:05.860
rack

54:05.860 --> 54:06.860
up against

54:06.860 --> 54:07.860
the side

54:07.860 --> 54:08.860
of the

54:08.860 --> 54:09.860
the side

54:09.860 --> 54:10.860
of the

54:10.860 --> 54:11.860
tent

54:11.860 --> 54:12.860
um

54:12.860 --> 54:13.860
who is

54:13.860 --> 54:14.860
heading over

54:14.860 --> 54:15.860
to the

54:15.860 --> 54:16.860
uh

54:16.860 --> 54:17.860
to the

54:17.860 --> 54:18.860
table

54:18.860 --> 54:19.860
whoever rolled

54:19.860 --> 54:20.860
the best

54:20.860 --> 54:21.860
ah

54:21.860 --> 54:22.860
we don't

54:22.860 --> 54:23.860
know

54:23.860 --> 54:24.860
whoever is

54:24.860 --> 54:25.860
going to

54:25.860 --> 54:26.860
take

54:26.860 --> 54:27.860
the initiative

54:27.860 --> 54:28.860
i am

54:28.860 --> 54:29.860
i am

54:29.860 --> 54:30.860
expert

54:30.860 --> 54:31.860
in stealth

54:31.860 --> 54:32.860
so i think

54:32.860 --> 54:33.860
i can

54:33.860 --> 54:34.860
okay

54:34.860 --> 54:35.860
so i have

54:35.860 --> 54:36.860
no idea

54:36.860 --> 54:37.860
if i actually

54:37.860 --> 54:38.860
rolled the

54:38.860 --> 54:39.860
best but

54:39.860 --> 54:40.860
uh

54:40.860 --> 54:41.860
statistically

54:41.860 --> 54:42.860
i think

54:42.860 --> 54:43.860
i have the

54:43.860 --> 54:44.860
best shot

54:44.860 --> 54:45.860
at it

54:45.860 --> 54:46.860
all right

54:46.860 --> 54:47.860
you move

54:47.860 --> 54:48.860
over to

54:48.860 --> 54:49.860
the table

54:49.860 --> 54:50.860
which

54:50.860 --> 54:51.860
would drop

54:51.860 --> 54:52.860
you

54:52.860 --> 54:53.860
right about

54:53.860 --> 54:54.860
here

54:54.860 --> 54:55.860
perfect

54:55.860 --> 54:56.860
excellent

54:56.860 --> 54:57.860
um

54:57.860 --> 54:58.860
now

54:58.860 --> 54:59.860
to

54:59.860 --> 55:00.860
to be

55:00.860 --> 55:01.860
clear

55:01.860 --> 55:02.860
uh

55:02.860 --> 55:03.860
real

55:03.860 --> 55:04.860
moving

55:04.860 --> 55:05.860
uh

55:05.860 --> 55:06.860
with

55:06.860 --> 55:07.860
um

55:07.860 --> 55:08.860
said

55:08.860 --> 55:09.860
uh

55:09.860 --> 55:10.860
50 units

55:10.860 --> 55:11.860
or whatever's

55:11.860 --> 55:12.860
left 35

55:12.860 --> 55:13.860
20 units

55:13.860 --> 55:14.860
and making

55:14.860 --> 55:15.860
those

55:15.860 --> 55:16.860
well

55:16.860 --> 55:17.860
actually

55:17.860 --> 55:18.860
i wouldn't

55:18.860 --> 55:19.860
so i might

55:19.860 --> 55:20.860
be seen

55:20.860 --> 55:21.860
never mind

55:21.860 --> 55:22.860
just kidding

55:22.860 --> 55:23.860
i am going

55:23.860 --> 55:24.860
to make

55:24.860 --> 55:25.860
a little

55:25.860 --> 55:26.860
pile right

55:26.860 --> 55:27.860
by the

55:27.860 --> 55:28.860
entrance

55:28.860 --> 55:29.860
point

55:29.860 --> 55:30.860
where we

55:30.860 --> 55:31.860
came in

55:31.860 --> 55:32.860
though

55:32.860 --> 55:33.860
uh

55:33.860 --> 55:34.860
so you

55:34.860 --> 55:35.860
head over

55:35.860 --> 55:36.860
to the

55:36.860 --> 55:37.860
table

55:37.860 --> 55:38.860
um

55:38.860 --> 55:39.860
and

55:39.860 --> 55:40.860
uh

55:40.860 --> 55:41.860

up

55:48.860 --> 55:49.860
onto

55:49.860 --> 55:50.860
the

55:50.860 --> 55:51.860
table

looking

56:02.860 --> 56:03.860

consulting

56:16.860 --> 56:17.860
my

56:17.860 --> 56:18.860
inventory

a lot

56:23.860 --> 56:24.860
of nothing

56:24.860 --> 56:25.860
so

56:25.860 --> 56:26.860
the table

56:26.860 --> 56:27.860
the table

56:27.860 --> 56:28.860
sits about

56:28.860 --> 56:29.860
10 feet

56:29.860 --> 56:30.860
off the

56:30.860 --> 56:31.860
ground

56:31.860 --> 56:32.860
like the

56:32.860 --> 56:33.860
top of

56:33.860 --> 56:34.860
the table

56:34.860 --> 56:35.860
so

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:56.500
flaming retribution stuff

01:01:56.500 --> 01:02:00.180
this could just be flaming retribution stuff

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:02.140
or it could be

01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:03.300
something else

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:05.940
these ogres

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:08.120
the ogres definitely appear

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:09.700
to be

01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:13.240
messing with elements

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:14.680
so

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:17.680
they could have

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:20.460
raised a land out of the sea

01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:21.740
potentially

01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:24.820
or it could be flaming retribution stuff

01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:25.140
but

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:26.480
who knows

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:29.480
or it could be a giant

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:31.420
turtle sea creature

01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:32.420
right

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:40.260
it could be that as well

01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:43.920
got their own floating fortress

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.600
alright cool

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:48.460
cool cool cool cool

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:50.000
good to know

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.240
alright sick

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.380
and

01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:55.440
yeah

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:59.480
I'm gonna grab as much of this crap into my backpack as I possibly can

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:00.820
alright

01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:02.400
so you grab

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.520
missives

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:04.200
battle

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:07.000
battle things

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.500
battle things

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:13.180
and that kind of

01:03:13.180 --> 01:03:14.100
that kind of thing

01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:16.800
I will also like I just posted

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:18.800
in the chat

01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:21.300
the giant battle map

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:23.380
so whoever wants to

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:24.960
you can pull that into your inventory

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:25.460
so you can get that

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:28.480
so you can access it and take a look at it at your leisure

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:30.480
quite reasonably

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:33.480
Ramsey seems like you'd have that

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.480
yep makes sense

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:35.480
cool

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:37.480
so as I'm doing that

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:41.480
stuffing stuff into my

01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.480
my pack

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:45.480
I'll just kind of be thinking to myself

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:49.480
like oh that's a really nice map

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.480
these are some nice missives

01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:53.480
I ought to trade them something real good

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:54.940
and I take out like some marbles that I've got here

01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:55.480
and I take out like some marbles that I've got here

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:56.100
and I take out like some marbles that I've got here

01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:56.480
like ah

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.600
like this is my best shooter

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.480
but this is worth it

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.720
I leave one marble on the table

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:05.980
and then I

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:06.980
I'm not a thief

01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:08.760
I traded for it

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:09.480
I'm not a thief

01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:11.460
gotta climb down from the table

01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:13.480
Um yeah

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:14.960
and start making my way out

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:16.880
my way

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.760
Alright as you do make your way out

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.480
you do actually

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:24.480
Alright as you do make your way out

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:26.400
pick up a few more

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.120
things along the way.

01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:29.180
Uh-huh.

01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:38.560
And I'm going to be posting those here.

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:40.220
Oh, this is going to be great.

01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:41.340
The five is going to

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:44.340
also get rid

01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:45.720
of any evidence of theft.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:50.620
Good plan.

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:57.000
Whenever I have a problem, I just throw a Molotov

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.060
cocktail, and suddenly, I have

01:04:59.060 --> 01:04:59.760
a different problem.

01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:02.700
A different problem. Thank you.

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:06.940
The difference in the problem is the key.

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:07.140
Okay.

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:12.900
All right. So, like, kind of

01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:14.940
as you're grabbing everything that you can

01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:16.940
see, there are a few

01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:18.740
things that are on the table that are

01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:20.600
more items

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:23.200
than they are

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:23.940
things

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:27.320
messages

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:28.460
and that kind of stuff.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:31.120
But they do seem

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:33.440
like they might

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.180
be useful.

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.060
And there's also

01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:39.260
a small bag of coins that are

01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:40.200
just sitting there.

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:41.840
Those are always useful.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:45.560
So,

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:51.340
yeah, so you are also able to

01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:53.260
pick those guys up

01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:53.740
as well.

01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:54.460
Hey!

01:05:54.480 --> 01:06:13.320
Oh, what's this?

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:17.880
Oh.

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:20.480
Repute.

01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:22.520
And the

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:23.520
Savitur's friend.

01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:24.460
Oh, yeah.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:26.220
Oh, that's

01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:28.540
so nice.

01:06:29.100 --> 01:06:30.440
Oh, that's fantastic.

01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:31.760
Love it.

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:33.760
Yeah, this is all about thievery.

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:35.980
Uh.

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:36.760
Uh.

01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:39.240
Maybe not.

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:40.520
Uh.

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:41.240
Uh.

01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:46.240
Uh.

01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:49.240
Uh.

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:49.320
Uh.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:49.420
Uh.

01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:49.500
Uh.

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:49.560
Uh.

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:49.800
Uh.

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:49.820
Uh.

01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:50.320
Uh.

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:50.820
Uh.

01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:50.920
Uh.

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:50.940
Uh.

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:50.980
Uh.

01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:51.040
Uh.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:51.060
Uh.

01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:51.080
Uh.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:51.120
Uh.

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:51.140
Uh.

01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:51.180
Uh.

01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:51.200
Uh.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:51.220
Uh.

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:51.240
Uh.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:51.260
Uh.

01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:51.320
Uh.

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:55.020
Uh.

01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:55.080
Uh.

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:55.120
Uh.

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:55.160
Uh.

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:55.180
Uh.

01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:55.220
Uh.

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:55.240
Uh.

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:55.260
Uh.

01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:55.280
Uh.

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:55.380
Uh.

01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:55.400
Uh.

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:55.440
Uh.

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:55.460
Uh.

01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:55.500
Uh.

01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:55.520
Uh.

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:55.640
Uh.

01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:55.660
Uh.

01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:55.700
Uh.

01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:55.720
Uh.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:56.040
Uh.

01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:56.180
Uh.

01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:56.300
Uh.

01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:56.340
Uh.

01:06:56.340 --> 01:06:56.360
Uh.

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:56.500
Uh.

01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:56.560
Uh.

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:56.640
Uh.

01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:56.700
Uh.

01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:56.740
Uh.

01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:56.820
Uh.

01:06:56.820 --> 01:06:56.840
Uh.

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:56.860
Uh.

01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:56.880
Uh.

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:56.940
Uh.

01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:57.100
Uh.

01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:57.140
Uh.

01:06:57.140 --> 01:06:57.180
Uh.

01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:00.260
All right.

01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:23.300
So and with that, over the cover of battle and that kind of thing, you are able to make it back out to where your friends are waiting, where your compatriots are waiting without being completely unnoticed.

01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:24.100
Excellent.

01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:25.140
well

01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:31.280
what do you guys do now

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:33.740
I would like to have been completely

01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:34.540
unnoticed

01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:41.020
I think it's time to leave

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:46.180
what about the dwarf

01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:55.240
we do have bigger problems on our hands

01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:57.120
yeah

01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:58.320
like I'm not

01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.620
entirely

01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:03.060
convinced just to leave

01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:04.080
them

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:06.500
but at the same time

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:08.960
I'm not certain

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:10.900
we can save them

01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:12.200
yeah

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:15.440
I'm not sure that all of them need to be

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.160
left

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:17.720
it would be

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:21.080
the hard thing is outfitting

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:21.840
them to fight

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.540
it would be nice to have them

01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:27.380
you know

01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:29.400
manage some guys

01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:32.300
but we don't have a way to outfit them

01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:34.280
yeah that's fair

01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:36.360
you're just standing behind

01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:38.500
you're just standing behind

01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:39.420
a thing of armor

01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:41.300
I am

01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:44.100
and I was thinking about that

01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:44.360
a big forest

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:47.180
that's my concern

01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:51.700
yeah these are ogre sized weapons

01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:52.760
I assume right Chris

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:54.140
or are they dwarf sized

01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:55.840
normal sized weapons

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.940
a little from column A

01:08:58.940 --> 01:08:59.980
a little from column B

01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:02.000
this appears to be kind of like

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.040
well not in your current location

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:06.700
your current location is 100% ogre weapons

01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:09.400
but in this tent

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:11.280
there does appear to be like a

01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:12.640
treasure pile

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:13.980
or a

01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:14.980
you know

01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:16.260
where

01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:17.900
there were

01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:19.780
where there are dwarf sized

01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:21.060
items

01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:22.080
that were

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:22.540
you know

01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:24.660
that were taken from the

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:26.120
taken from the captives

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.220
and taken as loot from the town

01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:29.420
so

01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:32.600
as far as outfitting

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:33.980
said dwarves

01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:36.720
you probably would be in a

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:38.460
you probably would be okay

01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:43.280
to be able to grab some of those things

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.220
especially considering

01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:44.880
that you

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.740
just picked up a bag of holding

01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:51.360
so you

01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:53.120
if you could get to it

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.720
so the treasure is actually

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:56.660
is actually over here

01:09:56.660 --> 01:09:57.580
okay

01:09:57.580 --> 01:09:59.860
but if you can get to it

01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:02.380
you could probably grab enough gear

01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:04.100
to be able to outfit the remainder

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:05.780
of the captives

01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:09.020
but that would be

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:11.180
significantly harder to

01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:14.120
do what

01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:15.120
you would need

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:16.120
to do

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:17.120
yeah

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:18.120
yeah

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:19.120
yeah

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:20.120
yeah

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:21.120
it's not impossible

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:22.120
like i mean you guys are

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:23.120
you guys are like super sneaky

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:24.120
especially for dwarves

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:27.120
so you might just pull it off

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.120
right

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.120
this is the

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:34.680
this is the sneakiest group of dwarves i've ever seen in my life

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:35.680
i was

01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:36.680
i was shocked

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:38.440
like i specifically made my dwarf sneaky

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:40.220
because i'm like we might need someone sneaky

01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:42.860
i don't think anyone else gonna make sneaky dwarves

01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:43.860
because who makes sneaky dwarves?

01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:45.860
i didn't

01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:46.860
i didn't

01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:47.860
it happened

01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:48.860
but i didn't

01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:52.860
i was i was really close to going rogue with this guy

01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:53.860
yeah

01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:54.860
yeah yeah yeah

01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:55.860
it really was

01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:56.860
um

01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:57.860
oh

01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:58.860
it's fantastic

01:10:58.860 --> 01:10:59.860
no it's great

01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:00.860
i love it

01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:01.860
but

01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:06.860
is there any reason to try to fight these guys?

01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:09.860
so here's here's

01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:10.860
a consideration

01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:11.860
now i don't know

01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:12.860
i don't know

01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:20.540
uh what the range on this this is but it's

01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:30.140
it's just it wouldn't be under control i'm like i could i can pull i can pull those metal objects

01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:38.640
to me the weapons right if i went out of the tent and got around on that side i could i could

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:45.740
pull the weapons in my direction just you know magnetic force i don't know how far out

01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:55.580
i can do that or how much weight um yeah that's the other thing i was going to say i don't know

01:11:55.580 --> 01:12:08.460
what the i don't know what it means that the language is yes we have a magneto right

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:10.860
i'm trying

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:19.980
the the magnetic field um it's free action

01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:27.360
it doesn't give me like magnetic field stance creature that's wearing metal armor has a metal

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:35.100
trait or is made of metal in your kinetic aura so it's inside your kinetic aura

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:38.160
i don't know what that is

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:38.620
how

01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:40.580
would i where do i find that

01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:43.940
it's very large

01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:52.520
yeah so when you're channeling elements you have a kinetic aura

01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:55.300
10 foot emanation base

01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:56.700
yeah

01:12:56.700 --> 01:13:04.860
where do you um channel elements okay channel elements kinetic aura

01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:06.480
great okay

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.920
um

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:24.580
I see how you got there

01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:33.700
ah excellent base kinesis uh trivial to create uh some of your element um or ultra portion of it

01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:38.180
that already exists choose one of your kinetic kinetic elements to effect uh impulse is a range

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:38.620
of 30 feet and then you have to create a base kinesis and then you have to create a base kinesis

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:39.020
and then you have to create a base kinesis

01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:39.700
and then you have to create a base kinesis

01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:47.880
uh bulk of the target must be negligible or light so some of the weapons but it would have to be like one at a time

01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:55.500
yeah oh and it wouldn't be able to be like armor um other than like light armor

01:13:55.500 --> 01:14:00.300
yeah light armor is light but anything medium or heavier you wouldn't be able to pull

01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:04.640
move

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:06.580
um

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:11.140
Would it make sense to go get them and bring them back here?

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:15.140
Like the wharfs?

01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:19.140
I mean, this is what we're going to be drawing all the ogres to.

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.760
Probably not.

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:22.200
Yeah.

01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:23.180
Great.

01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:27.620
Well, if we start on fire and blow it up, the weapon should survive.

01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:29.660
Well, yes.

01:14:30.020 --> 01:14:30.440
Yes.

01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:32.420
But all the ogres will be here.

01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:33.940
That's the concern.

01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:38.320
We're trying to draw all the ogres.

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:44.240
You guys are trying to draw all the ogres to the tent, so you'll succeed.

01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:45.600
I shouldn't be there.

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:52.780
I'm also not sure if these dwarves have been imprisoned for days.

01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:56.340
They may not be in good fighting shape, even if we do arm them.

01:14:57.140 --> 01:14:57.440
Right.

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:00.680
That's good thinking, too.

01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:02.460
But.

01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:08.480
I don't know.

01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:10.240
So it's most important that we get this.

01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:13.260
Yeah.

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:17.280
I like your logic there, Ramsey.

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.960
One of the questions is how many dwarves we got in these cages.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:21.460
Yeah.

01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:24.740
Also, they're probably not all warriors, necessarily.

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:25.860
Right.

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:29.200
In fact, most of the warriors probably died.

01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:30.460
Yeah.

01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:31.380
Warrior.

01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:31.900
Warrior.

01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:32.340
Well.

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:33.540
Yeah.

01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:33.800
Right.

01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:33.880
Right.

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:33.900
Right.

01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:33.920
Right.

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:33.940
Right.

01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:36.920
Did you know that there are at least a few fighters in there?

01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:40.400
I mean, Captain Kale was one of them.

01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:41.020
You know?

01:15:41.060 --> 01:15:41.200
Yeah.

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:41.640
So.

01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:46.640
We don't know if they're in any better shape than he was.

01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:47.760
Right.

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:57.600
They might not be, but he basically, he was in worse shape, not from the escape, but from

01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:59.000
the cave-in.

01:15:59.520 --> 01:15:59.800
Yeah.

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:00.140
Yeah.

01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:00.600
Yeah.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:02.160
So.

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:02.700
Yeah.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:03.720
But maybe.

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:04.440
That was the kind of way.

01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:14.640
Maybe what we can do is start the fire in the immediate chaos, like the seconds following

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:15.040
it.

01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:23.260
You can maybe pull a few weapons, two or three maybe, and then we escape up the escape route.

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:24.680
Mm-hmm.

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:29.440
It won't be a ton, but we can figure out the.

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:30.600
Right.

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:33.680
The potential on fire and where it's coming from and what's happening.

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:34.060
So.

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:35.560
Right.

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:35.880
Right.

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:37.520
I think we got.

01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:43.740
We probably won't be able to get a whole lot of weapons, but we could equip some of the

01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:44.140
fighters.

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:47.680
Yeah.

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:52.540
And do we think that dwarf inside the tent is too far gone?

01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:00.520
Maybe.

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:00.680
Maybe.

01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:03.160
Like, my thing about that one is.

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:08.560
I don't know how we get them out without alerting everybody.

01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:09.860
Mm-hmm.

01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:11.980
Um.

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:18.980
And then also, I don't know if they're too far gone or not.

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:19.180
I.

01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:20.640
That I have no idea.

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:25.240
Yeah.

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:32.320
Yeah.

01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:33.440
I think that's a comeback.

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:34.880
I think that's a comeback and rescue, if possible.

01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:36.600
Yeah.

01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:37.100
Yeah.

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:37.920
That's.

01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:39.780
That might not be a bad idea.

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:43.280
But I think.

01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:44.960
We've got to see how they react.

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:44.980
It's not.

01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:48.360
We've given it the best go that we can, you know, but.

01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:48.940
Yeah.

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:49.400
Yeah.

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:55.820
I think trying to get that one is a big risk to maybe save one person, but it jeopardizes

01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:56.920
everybody else.

01:17:57.540 --> 01:17:57.700
Yep.

01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:58.700
Everybody else.

01:17:58.940 --> 01:17:59.420
Absolutely.

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:00.620
That's.

01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:02.000
And that's, you know, like.

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:03.320
That's a calculated.

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:07.220
That's a calculated decision.

01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:08.440
Yep.

01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:09.640
Yep.

01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:10.760
Very calculated decision.

01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:13.860
So.

01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:16.680
All right.

01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:18.240
I'm going to.

01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:19.540
Yeah.

01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:22.460
Everybody's perfectly fine.

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:23.660
Almost.

01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:25.400
I'm trying to.

01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:25.920
Oh, well.

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:27.780
Back myself out of the tent there.

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:29.080
Yeah.

01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:30.220
Oh.

01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:31.100
And.

01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:42.880
I'm going to get to start moving lighting position and start moving around the tent

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:43.280
here.

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:43.780
Oh, no.

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:45.380
Mm hmm.

01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:48.580
All right.

01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:55.080
And I'll maybe we'll just sort of time and be like, I'll I'll give you a, I don't know,

01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:57.040
a minute and then I'm going to light the fire.

01:18:58.040 --> 01:18:58.540
Yep.

01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:01.000
So I think I'm in pretty good position.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:08.520
I'm in good position to pull those things toward me.

01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:10.820
Okay.

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:23.760
I'm assuming that this is a rack or a pile or something that I can still derive some

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:26.660
cover from when I poke my head under.

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:28.280
Right.

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:28.700
Right.

01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:29.780
So I'm not.

01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:29.880
So I'm not.

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:29.980
I'm not.

01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:30.020
I'm not.

01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:30.140
I'm not.

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:30.180
I'm not.

01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:30.320
I'm not.

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:30.380
I'm not.

01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:30.420
I'm not.

01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:30.900
I'm not.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:31.420
I'm not.

01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:31.460
I'm not.

01:19:31.460 --> 01:19:31.480
I'm not.

01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:31.700
Yeah.

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:32.020
Yeah.

01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:32.700
And that's fine.

01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:37.840
That'll reflect the that'll reflect the DC of what you need to hit.

01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:42.800
And I'm and I'm not going to make a roll for like, you know, whether or not you're getting

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.460
weapons, you're you're you're pulling what you can.

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:53.820
But I am going to need you to make another stealth role because you're you are floating

01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:55.120
weapons in the air.

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:56.080
I know.

01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:56.480
Right.

01:19:57.660 --> 01:19:58.100
Right.

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:00.300
So, I mean.

01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:00.380
I mean.

01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:08.680
I mean, so let's see here, which would be a stealth.

01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:10.680
No, it wouldn't be a stealth.

01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:14.220
It would be it would be palm and object.

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:16.680
What the heck is that?

01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:19.020
Kind of is that's that's in theory.

01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:24.700
It's kind of odd, but in this case, I think it applies.

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:26.100
I was going to say.

01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:28.680
You're just range palming an object, but.

01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:30.340
Concealing an object.

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:33.160
OK, but yeah, I see palm and object.

01:20:33.340 --> 01:20:33.440
Yeah.

01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:33.960
OK.

01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:34.760
Yeah.

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:37.600
Avoid stealing.

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:42.660
I can't tell what that is.

01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:44.420
Is that a five?

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:44.720
Yeah.

01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:46.920
That was a five.

01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:48.480
All right.

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:48.860
Well.

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:52.020
It's a five plus eight, which was a 13.

01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:53.080
Yeah.

01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:54.160
On a DC 20.

01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:54.880
That's not good.

01:20:58.500 --> 01:20:58.940
Right.

01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:05.160
So I'm just making crap up, right?

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:10.300
I mean, you can use a hero point or again, at the same time, I'm light in the fire.

01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:12.580
So maybe it doesn't matter if we're noticed.

01:21:12.740 --> 01:21:14.380
We're out of here.

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:15.260
Right.

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:16.000
Your call.

01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:17.220
Yeah.

01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:24.960
I would I would have no like I would have no idea.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:27.560
Really?

01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:30.300
Like I'm I'm focused on pulling.

01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:31.300
This stuff toward me.

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:32.300
I'm not.

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:32.820
Yeah.

01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:33.040
Yeah.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:34.240
OK.

01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:37.660
So like so far as I know, things are going well.

01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:38.560
Yeah.

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:38.820
Yeah.

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:39.300
OK.

01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:39.860
So you.

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:40.780
Simultaneous to this.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.980
I'm spark spark.

01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:44.380
OK.

01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:46.860
Um.

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:47.480
OK.

01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:49.020
So.

01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:50.340
Um.

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:56.020
What I'm going to do here.

01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:57.960
Is.

01:21:59.060 --> 01:21:59.540
Ramsey.

01:21:59.540 --> 01:21:59.640
Ramsey.

01:21:59.640 --> 01:21:59.680
Ramsey.

01:21:59.680 --> 01:21:59.700
Ramsey.

01:21:59.700 --> 01:21:59.720
Ramsey.

01:21:59.720 --> 01:21:59.740
Ramsey.

01:21:59.740 --> 01:21:59.760
Ramsey.

01:21:59.760 --> 01:21:59.780
Ramsey.

01:21:59.780 --> 01:21:59.800
Ramsey.

01:21:59.800 --> 01:21:59.840
Ramsey.

01:21:59.840 --> 01:21:59.860
Ramsey.

01:21:59.860 --> 01:21:59.880
Ramsey.

01:21:59.880 --> 01:21:59.920
Ramsey.

01:21:59.920 --> 01:21:59.940
Ramsey.

01:21:59.940 --> 01:21:59.960
Ramsey.

01:21:59.960 --> 01:21:59.980
Ramsey.

01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:00.340
Ramsey.

01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:00.420
Ramsey.

01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:00.440
Ramsey.

01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:00.460
Ramsey.

01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:00.520
Ramsey.

01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:00.560
Ramsey.

01:22:00.580 --> 01:22:00.600
Ramsey.

01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:00.680
Ramsey.

01:22:00.680 --> 01:22:01.480
Ramsey and agility.

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:05.920
Just a flat agility.

01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:07.940
And I would also like.

01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:10.820
Demlar to roll a flat agility.

01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:12.360
Just.

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:14.480
Just to determine order of operations.

01:22:15.680 --> 01:22:15.780
Uh.

01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:20.620
I'm not even sure how to.

01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:22.620
That's what I'm looking for.

01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:27.020
I mean, I can just roll a D 20.

01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:27.980
Yeah.

01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:29.100
Just roll the 20.

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:30.300
Nope.

01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:30.340
Nope.

01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:30.360
Nope.

01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:30.980
That was an 8.

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:33.660
Looked like a 20.

01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:34.640
There's a 20.

01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:37.660
How do I... Oh, I can do

01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:39.340
1d20

01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:40.600
plus 4.

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:43.020
Right? Nope. Slash roll?

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:45.580
Yeah, I think it's slash roll.

01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:51.080
Excellent.

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:52.580
Alright.

01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:54.380
Jason.

01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:55.860
Oh, yes.

01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:58.400
I'm going to need you to

01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:00.060
roll a d20

01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:01.000
as well.

01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:04.440
Can I

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:06.320
just click this d20 under the bottom

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:08.300
of the chat? Yes.

01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:09.020
Yeah.

01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:11.620
Oh!

01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:13.180
I did.

01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:15.280
God.

01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:18.160
You with the rolls. Man.

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:20.420
What did I do? Wasted it.

01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:22.580
I didn't mean to hit that.

01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:25.580
You wasted that.

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:28.080
I was just hovering over it.

01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:28.340
Alright, so.

01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:29.620
Clicked.

01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:33.560
So, in this case,

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:35.200
it actually did work in your favor.

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.540
So, the person who rolled

01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:39.420
highest in this case

01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:40.260
is

01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:42.900
Rurik.

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:45.880
He was able

01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:47.900
to start the

01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:48.800
chain reaction

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:51.400
before

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:54.100
Semlar

01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:55.060
was noticed.

01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:55.280
Yes.

01:23:57.740 --> 01:23:58.260
So,

01:23:58.260 --> 01:24:20.760
the, the good thing is both the ogre, both of the ogres that were fighting noticed the fire and start running towards that at the same time that the ogre, that the female ogre notices Emlor and starts moving towards him.

01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:24.460
So, we're going to need to roll some initiative.

01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:28.240
Oh, way to go.

01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:33.460
So it's actually not W stumble name claims except it says we have a fire objetivo though.

01:24:33.700 --> 01:24:36.020
Yeah, this, this

01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:37.700
is not .

01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:38.340
No w sólo

01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:39.340
I've

01:24:39.780 --> 01:24:40.560
But

01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:43.300
we 하�כ BER.

01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:47.140
Uh,

01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:48.120
did you

01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:50.760
do that?

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:51.900
You have to roll

01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:52.980
perception.

01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:54.220
I always

01:24:54.220 --> 01:24:55.160
.

01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:56.240
How you changed that.

01:24:56.240 --> 01:24:57.480
Just on your character sheet.

01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:57.920
That makes it現在

01:24:57.920 --> 01:24:59.820
the main thing in the

01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:01.760
initiative section. You can change what skill

01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:02.340
you're using.

01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:05.620
Oh,

01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:06.600
where's Ghost Rider?

01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:08.140
Right?

01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:10.740
Chris's house.

01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:13.080
Oh, I see. Yeah, yeah.

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:15.580
So I'm gonna roll

01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:17.320
stealth, because I get

01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:19.860
cool sniper bonuses when I

01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:20.820
roll stealth for initiative.

01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:22.400
Hmm.

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:25.760
I will continue

01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:26.360
to use

01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:28.080
Perception,

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:31.380
because why wouldn't I?

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:33.600
Maybe

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:35.120
your stealth is better than your Perception.

01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:36.040
Oh, yeah.

01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:37.780
It's not.

01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:41.020
Mine are the same,

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:43.320
but, I don't know,

01:25:43.420 --> 01:25:44.120
my stealth is better.

01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:47.420
My Perception's just

01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:49.340
one point better. Not that it

01:25:49.340 --> 01:25:51.480
matters when somebody's always

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:53.260
rolling 19s.

01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:54.280
Alright.

01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:56.340
I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:59.180
And the best that I can do is a

01:25:59.180 --> 01:25:59.800
flipping

01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:03.320
single digit.

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:04.400
Yeah.

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:07.220
Alright, so we have started

01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:07.900
combat.

01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:10.320
The Ogre Warrior

01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:13.220
is going first,

01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:14.920
and she calls out,

01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:17.420
Hey! What are you doing?

01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:18.460
Thief!

01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:21.140
And runs towards you.

01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:23.480
Um,

01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:25.480
she rips open,

01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:25.940
she,

01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:28.500
she takes her greataxe

01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:30.380
off, off of her back,

01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:32.120
and rips through

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:33.440
the, uh,

01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:36.240
rips through the, the,

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:37.660
the wall of the tent,

01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:40.540
and she will attack you.

01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:41.920
Hmm.

01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:43.260
Hmm.

01:26:51.700 --> 01:26:53.640
We'll say you have light cover.

01:26:56.360 --> 01:27:02.360
Swinging with her mightyaxe,

01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:03.220
she does,

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:04.980
she hits you,

01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:05.920
um,

01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:08.360
but is not quite able

01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:09.600
to do

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:11.440
a critical hit.

01:27:12.420 --> 01:27:13.060
Um.

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:15.280
Okay, yeah, whatever.

01:27:15.660 --> 01:27:16.520
We're gonna leave it alone.

01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:20.000
And she does nine points of damage to Demlar.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:20.120
There.

01:27:23.980 --> 01:27:25.560
That's about the right sound.

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:26.000
That was,

01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:27.360
that was a good one.

01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:27.380
Yeah.

01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:31.640
Moving on.

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:33.880
Ramsey.

01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:35.260
Excellent.

01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:36.040
What is,

01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:38.800
what is, uh,

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:39.940
Okay, so there is

01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:42.900
some definite sounds of combat

01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:44.080
coming from over there.

01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:45.260
Right.

01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:48.220
Oh, that's fine.

01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:49.580
I think, um,

01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:52.660
I think the plan

01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:53.740
is still the plan.

01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:54.760
This was part of the initiative,

01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:55.760
uh,

01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:56.340
because of my,

01:27:56.340 --> 01:27:57.640
my ability,

01:27:57.820 --> 01:27:59.060
I got to draw my weapon.

01:27:59.220 --> 01:27:59.940
So I did that.

01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:01.500
Uh, so I've already got

01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:02.220
my weapon in hand.

01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:03.100
Um.

01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:06.020
I am just going to,

01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:06.700
uh,

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:07.780
move,

01:28:08.120 --> 01:28:09.920
um,

01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:10.760
my

01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:16.800
25 feet

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:18.140
for action one.

01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:20.940
Um,

01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:22.780
I will move

01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:23.940
my

01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:29.240
25 more feet for action two.

01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:33.560
Um, I can't see anything.

01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:34.040
Can I?

01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:35.540
Cause that's just a tent.

01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:35.960
No.

01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:37.580
Uh, sick.

01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:38.540
Well, uh,

01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:39.460
plans the plan.

01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:43.220
We're going to move 25 more feet to get to the roots for action three.

01:28:44.540 --> 01:28:45.380
That's all we got.

01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:46.820
All right.

01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:51.220
And I can probably see her now,

01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:52.420
but now is too late.

01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:54.460
Yes, you can see her.

01:28:55.100 --> 01:28:56.100
Um, excellent.

01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:56.940
This guy,

01:28:57.100 --> 01:28:57.600
the,

01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:01.540
the ogres don't really notice what's happening over here.

01:29:03.020 --> 01:29:03.520
Um,

01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:05.340
and so the ogre glutton,

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:06.180
um,

01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:12.000
runs up to the edge and calls and calls out,

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.880
says fire,

01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:14.780
fire,

01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:20.220
bring water and starts trying to like douse the fire.

01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:25.860
But given that you made this fire with black powder,

01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:28.580
it's very quickly become,

01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:29.580
uh,

01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:30.580
uh,

01:29:30.580 --> 01:29:31.580
out of control.

01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:32.580
Excellent.

01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:33.580
Excellent.

01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:34.580
Yes.

01:29:34.580 --> 01:29:35.580
So not a small amount of it.

01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:36.580
Yes.

01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:37.580
Denluri, you are up now.

01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:38.580
Oh my gosh.

01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:39.580
Uh, I'm sorry.

01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:40.580
Uh, Alison's telling me some,

01:29:40.580 --> 01:29:41.580
uh,

01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:42.580
uh,

01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:43.580
uh,

01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:44.580
uh,

01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:45.580
uh,

01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:46.580
uh,

01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:47.580
uh,

01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:48.580
uh,

01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:49.580
uh,

01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:50.580
uh,

01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:51.580
uh,

01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:52.580
uh,

01:29:52.580 --> 01:29:53.580
uh,

01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:54.580
uh,

01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:55.580
uh,

01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:57.100
like,

01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:58.100
okay,

01:29:58.100 --> 01:29:59.180
we got this.

01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:00.180
Okay.

01:30:00.180 --> 01:30:01.180
Okay.

01:30:01.180 --> 01:30:05.480
You guys done?

01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:11.620
I wanna write a couple books now just barely reading and saying

01:30:11.620 --> 01:30:13.620
half the reassortments.

01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:17.620
I'll put you in here.

01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:19.200
He's up.

01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:21.040
He'll read at me.

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:22.040
Uh,

01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:23.040
wow.

01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:24.040
Nice.

01:30:24.040 --> 01:30:25.040
Okay,

01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:26.040
This one's for our audience.

01:30:26.040 --> 01:30:28.120
I'm sorry

01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:30.960
I've already got

01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:31.640
all my

01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:33.160
you know

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:39.100
elemental stuff

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:40.440
up and running

01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:43.080
I don't need doing

01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:43.560
that

01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:47.000
alright so

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.740
at the moment

01:30:48.740 --> 01:31:13.080
I don't think

01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:15.100
that's I don't know I probably ought to give that

01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:16.440
a go but I'm not going to do it

01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:17.280
um

01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:18.200
um

01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:25.900
nope that one's not

01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:27.760
a good idea that's like a Hail Mary

01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:29.880
I think alright yeah I'm just going to go

01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:31.860

01:31:31.860 --> 01:31:33.960
blast there so I'm going

01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:35.460
to target her

01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:38.100
yep she's targeted

01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:39.640
and

01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:40.840
um

01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:48.680
when I

01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:48.720
when I

01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:48.740

01:31:48.740 --> 01:31:49.520
do that

01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:52.000
I want to do that out of the

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.540
the hub thing right

01:31:53.540 --> 01:31:55.380
HUD

01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:57.160
actions

01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:58.960
um

01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:02.060
do I do the two

01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:03.400
action one

01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:05.380
yeah

01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:06.280
right

01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:08.420
and then

01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:11.220
what button do I click next

01:32:11.220 --> 01:32:13.160
um so

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:15.780
you're in melee so you want to click

01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:17.380
the blast that's got

01:32:17.380 --> 01:32:18.720
that has

01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:23.580
the uh that has the sword next to it rather than the one that looks like the fireball

01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:27.340
oh okay

01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:38.760
alrighty and I've got it set I think on the bottom first like there's electricity piercing or slashing so I've got it for slashing is that the appropriate one or

01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:44.400
you currently have it set for slashing yeah but you could change it to piercing or electricity if you want it

01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:45.720
oh really

01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:46.960

01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:53.580

01:32:53.580 --> 01:32:55.680
I might do piercing

01:32:55.680 --> 01:32:58.680

01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:04.280
and then we'll click the button

01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:06.660

01:33:56.720 --> 01:34:01.720
all the two and did 18 points of damage to her

01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:03.720
I am

01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:05.720
um

01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:07.720
Google better

01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:09.720
yes

01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:14.720
those were two actions would what's your next what's your what's your third action gonna be

01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:16.720
um

01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:17.720
yeah

01:34:17.720 --> 01:34:18.720
yeah

01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:19.720
of course

01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:20.720
no

01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:21.720
no

01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:22.720
yeah

01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:23.720
I don't know

01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:24.720
yeah

01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:25.720
um

01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:26.720
can I do the bleeding rubies

01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:27.720
it looks like that's one action am I wrong

01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:29.920
uh no you can totally do that

01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:31.680
yeah that is the intent

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:33.680
all right

01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:34.680
so

01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:35.680
I'm

01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:37.880
I'm gonna bleed rubies how do I

01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:39.400
just hit the use button

01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:41.020
click the use button yeah

01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:42.940
use

01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:48.120
oh I did it twice sorry

01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:50.720
It's okay

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000
See here

01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:09.500
All right, so she has a 1d6 bleed

01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:15.220
So you basically like

01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:16.520
Um

01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:23.340
So the bleeding ruby is basically what they do is like any wound that you cause it just makes that wound not cauterize or not

01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:24.440
clot

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:27.480
So she's just constantly bleeding from that wound

01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:30.240
so

01:35:31.900 --> 01:35:37.080
That's what you do, right I do it do it

01:35:37.980 --> 01:35:39.980
all right, then the

01:35:41.220 --> 01:35:45.000
Then the the big ogre that was running he

01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:50.280
Over there. He sees what's happening as the other ogre is trying to knock out the fire

01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:54.220
He

01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:59.780
He runs over here tries to knock out the fire a bit and then starts running

01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:08.480
And starts running this direction to try and get to the

01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:14.660
To the entrance to oh he's not going for the table

01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:17.320
I thought he was like

01:36:17.340 --> 01:36:19.200
yes

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:20.820
Not just yes

01:36:20.820 --> 01:36:26.220
But he is running by the table and he may notice that there are no papers there

01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:31.880
But they have you maybe he's just all overcome as well

01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:35.240
All right

01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:37.880
Again you're up

01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:43.380
Chris I'm trying to understand this pump pray thing better

01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:52.040
i don't really see the help in combat there i see the help

01:36:52.040 --> 01:37:01.580
okay go ahead the help in combat isn't in the prey it's in the effect of your other abilities

01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:12.920
on your hunted prey so you're a you're a flurry um a flurry ranger when you swing your when you

01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:22.800
swing your weapon um against your non-hunted prey you have the regular multiple attack penalty so

01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:29.640
it's neg five for every attack you make but if you're going against your hunted prey it's a

01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:35.900
negative three so you can swing you can you're more likely to hit more often with your with

01:37:35.900 --> 01:37:42.780
your multiple attacks so that's the value that it brings if you are a precision

01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:42.900
ranger you're a flurry ranger you're a flurry ranger you're a flurry ranger you're a flurry ranger

01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:51.240
then you would deal extra damage to your hunted prey if you know that that's that's that's why

01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:58.240
so the actual ability itself doesn't actually grant you bonuses but it makes your other

01:37:58.240 --> 01:38:08.020
abilities better nice okay um am i in range to hit her do i have to move

01:38:08.020 --> 01:38:12.880
uh you are actually technically in range to hit her

01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:19.900
so she's uh she is diagonally in the location that you can be

01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:26.840
just making sure everything's right

01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:36.120
so i shouldn't does twin takedown take two actions

01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:42.340
twin takedown takes one action which is what makes it so sick

01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:56.920
so it's one action to marker as hunted prey then you can twin takedown and then you have another action

01:38:56.920 --> 01:39:04.340
seems pretty good all right one of those was a crit and one of those was a hit

01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:07.500
oh it seems like it's gonna do a lot of damage

01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:10.080
so click so

01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:12.740
yep the

01:39:12.740 --> 01:39:12.760
the

01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:23.240
oh gosh

01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:28.660
it's hard nice

01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:36.440
well he he crit that that was yeah yeah yeah also it's like one more point that you did

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:42.600
it's uh yeah it's the 2d8 instead of 1d8 and uh

01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:44.100
ha ha you know like

01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:50.180
oh my gosh Yeah yeah yeah that's impressive

01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:52.200
wow dude

01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:58.020
Yeah but his his crit but Jason your crit only did one point of damage more than your crit

01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:02.840
he just got two attacks so

01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:03.700
yeah yeah okay

01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:04.500
yeah yeah yeah okay

01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:08.500
like just just for the record you hit like a truck too buddy

01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:12.380
i did yes i did i was quite pleased with his truck in the wrong spot

01:40:12.380 --> 01:40:20.380
just kidding did i do that wrong though chris where i get 2d8 even on my second hit

01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:29.580
yeah because like your weapon is now striking yeah so you so you do 2d8 um it's not a regular

01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:35.100
hit but the way that crits work is it just doubles your damage so you roll your 2d8

01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:42.260
you add your modifier and then you double it that's that's how each of my weapon can do a

01:40:42.260 --> 01:40:46.860
2d8 damage right and i'm pretty sure

01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:59.580
i'm pretty sure that the elemental blast i know the elemental blast still does 1d8

01:40:59.580 --> 01:41:11.540
the gate gate attenuator do

01:41:12.260 --> 01:41:25.260
so she's dead is that what i'm seeing yeah you killed her i'm gonna leave behind i move her

01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:33.340
behind her large body in front of me okay that sounds like uh oh you move behind her large body

01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:41.820
okay um you okay so you hunt or i could do something else

01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:46.860
well i mean it just depends on what your intentions are here are you uh

01:41:47.740 --> 01:41:53.420
are you wanting to run away or are you wanting to continue to fight or

01:41:56.220 --> 01:41:58.860
you're right i can move closer to this girl and let her hit me

01:42:02.540 --> 01:42:11.580
oh yeah i don't know you could do that i think we're we're not fighting these big two dudes are we

01:42:12.260 --> 01:42:18.700

01:44:57.400 --> 01:45:10.280
brawn

01:45:12.260 --> 01:45:14.540
weren't able to make it all the way up

01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:16.500
you're about halfway up within the round

01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:16.780
okay

01:45:16.780 --> 01:45:18.620
sick

01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:21.120
somewhere in there

01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:22.180
yeah

01:45:22.180 --> 01:45:26.620
it'll take you one more combat turn

01:45:26.620 --> 01:45:28.480
combat turn to get up there

01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:30.700
you do still have other actions

01:45:30.700 --> 01:45:31.840
that you can spend

01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:34.800
you just can't spend them to get up the

01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:36.540
get up the rope

01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:38.540

yep that's all I got

01:45:57.260 --> 01:45:59.220

01:46:10.500 --> 01:46:10.520
he's got a lot of

01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:12.640
he's going to continue to try and put out the

01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:13.700
the thing

01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:15.720

01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:26.820
so

01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:28.720
I did not realize that

01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:29.360
while you

01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:30.360
yeah

01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:30.820
so

01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:32.660
that that's why I'm telling you

01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:33.200
because

01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:35.200
you

01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:36.340
your your character

01:47:36.340 --> 01:47:37.260
at least would

01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:38.480
would have realized

01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:39.280
he's

01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:40.460
he's stuck in metal

01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:42.120
doesn't mean that

01:47:42.120 --> 01:47:43.300
there's necessarily

01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:44.260
something you can do

01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:44.680
about it

01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:45.100
but

01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:47.160
as you happen to be

01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:48.700
a metal kineticist

01:47:48.700 --> 01:47:49.940
if anybody

01:47:49.940 --> 01:47:51.100
could fix the situation

01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:52.580
without walking into it

01:47:52.580 --> 01:47:54.940
you could do it

01:47:54.940 --> 01:47:58.040
so

01:47:58.040 --> 01:47:58.820
yeah

01:47:58.820 --> 01:47:59.720
I think I

01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:01.180
think you're probably right

01:48:01.180 --> 01:48:02.320
um

01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:03.440
hmm

01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:06.440
yeah

01:48:10.460 --> 01:48:29.120
, so there is the magnetic field thing

01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:37.120
there's something else though that I can do

01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:40.120
where is that?

01:48:40.460 --> 01:48:54.180
why don't you show them the

01:48:54.180 --> 01:48:57.580
well there's the extract element

01:48:57.580 --> 01:48:58.720
yeah, I thought about that

01:48:58.720 --> 01:48:59.880
do you want to try and do something fancy about that?

01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:01.620
looks like it has to be

01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:02.340
part of

01:49:02.340 --> 01:49:04.600
the creature

01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:10.280
so, it doesn't work with objects?

01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:13.880
there's another one

01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:22.340
maybe it's the base kinesis

01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:24.580
yeah

01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:26.740
the base kinesis is the one I'm thinking of

01:49:26.740 --> 01:49:32.420
that one

01:49:32.420 --> 01:49:36.460
I can move an existing piece of the element

01:49:36.460 --> 01:49:38.500
up to 20 feet in any direction

01:49:38.500 --> 01:49:43.760
and suppress

01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:47.320
destroy an existing piece of element

01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:59.020
a metal lock it says no no too

01:49:59.020 --> 01:50:01.440
so I'm assuming that I can't

01:50:01.440 --> 01:50:05.020
just destroy a link in the chain

01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:09.260
um

01:50:09.260 --> 01:50:11.000
why would you assume that

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:15.500
it says crafted goods

01:50:15.500 --> 01:50:20.320
um

01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:22.340
yeah I'm sorry

01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:22.900
like

01:50:22.900 --> 01:50:26.200
maybe I misheard you

01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:28.600
you're thinking about like

01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:31.100
destroying a link in the chain right

01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:32.660
right yeah

01:50:32.660 --> 01:50:34.100
okay okay

01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:35.740
that you can totally do

01:50:35.740 --> 01:50:37.920
I thought you were like I don't think I can do that

01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:38.500
and I was like why not

01:50:38.500 --> 01:50:40.560
I don't think you why you don't

01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:41.760
why don't you think you can do that

01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:44.160
I didn't think that I could do that

01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:45.580
because it's like I would

01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:48.420
I would assume that that's a crafted good

01:50:48.420 --> 01:50:49.020
it was a

01:50:49.020 --> 01:50:50.820
you know

01:50:50.820 --> 01:50:51.960
but I

01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:55.360
yeah I mean it's

01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:56.300
it is

01:50:56.300 --> 01:50:57.640
but at the same time

01:50:57.640 --> 01:50:58.480
I can see it being wishy-washy

01:50:58.480 --> 01:50:58.820
so

01:50:58.820 --> 01:51:01.300
yeah that I think that was the

01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:03.660
that was the direction I was gonna go with it

01:51:03.660 --> 01:51:04.740
was the base kinesis

01:51:04.740 --> 01:51:06.260
and whether it's

01:51:06.260 --> 01:51:08.260
me moving

01:51:08.500 --> 01:51:09.840
things around

01:51:09.840 --> 01:51:11.600
or

01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:13.720
destroying that

01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:14.740
just a like

01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:16.880
yeah

01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:18.940
like looking critical link

01:51:18.940 --> 01:51:20.340
I break this one

01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:21.540
he can work himself out

01:51:21.540 --> 01:51:27.540
that would be the way that I'd

01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:28.680
I'd want to run that

01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:32.460
okay

01:51:32.460 --> 01:51:34.260
um

01:51:34.260 --> 01:51:35.440
you will let me

01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:38.300
trying to see if there's any role that you didn't make on

01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:38.480
this

01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:40.720
but I'm not seeing one so

01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:41.960
yeah I don't see one either

01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:43.580
it has a range of

01:51:43.580 --> 01:51:44.160
I guess

01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:46.860
I guess it just happens

01:51:46.860 --> 01:51:47.320
you

01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:48.120
um

01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:48.420
okay

01:51:48.420 --> 01:51:49.500
okay so you

01:51:49.500 --> 01:51:50.800
uh

01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:54.260
you find a piece of the chain

01:51:54.260 --> 01:51:55.360
like with your

01:51:55.360 --> 01:51:56.420
with your elemental

01:51:56.420 --> 01:51:58.080
with your elemental

01:51:58.080 --> 01:51:59.800
attuning

01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:01.920
you find a piece of the chain

01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:03.620
that is

01:52:03.620 --> 01:52:04.520
um

01:52:04.520 --> 01:52:07.620
that is specifically weak

01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:07.840
to

01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:08.000
to

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:08.480
to

01:52:08.480 --> 01:52:09.200
, uh

01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:10.240
and you

01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:11.320
just

01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:12.640
destroy it

01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:13.200
and

01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:14.540
given

01:52:14.540 --> 01:52:16.180
kind of how you understand

01:52:16.180 --> 01:52:17.020
the metal element

01:52:17.020 --> 01:52:18.220
you basically destroy

01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:18.600
the

01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:19.420
a link

01:52:19.420 --> 01:52:20.360
uh

01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:20.680
go ahead

01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:21.720
roll a crafting skill

01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:22.260
actually

01:52:22.260 --> 01:52:22.640
roll

01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:23.420
roll crafting

01:52:23.420 --> 01:52:25.120
yeah

01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:26.620
that's a neat one

01:52:26.620 --> 01:52:27.760
no

01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:28.360
that's not

01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:30.920
and for this

01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:31.580
I like I

01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:32.460
this is gonna be

01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:32.900
again

01:52:32.900 --> 01:52:34.340
it's gonna be a simple thing

01:52:34.340 --> 01:52:35.160
we'll call it

01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:36.420
we'll call it a DC

01:52:36.420 --> 01:52:36.940
of a

01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:37.960
a DC 10

01:52:37.960 --> 01:52:38.460
so if you're

01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:39.160
able to get

01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:40.300
over a DC 10

01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:41.440
then you're able

01:52:41.440 --> 01:52:42.140
to kind of

01:52:42.140 --> 01:52:43.440
destroy the chain

01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:44.720
enough

01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:45.920
that it just kind of

01:52:45.920 --> 01:52:47.220
falls off the guy

01:52:47.220 --> 01:52:48.260
um

01:52:48.260 --> 01:52:49.580
with the DC 5

01:52:49.580 --> 01:52:50.600
you would

01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:51.080
it says

01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:52.020
all right

01:52:52.020 --> 01:52:53.320
so I just hit the crafting

01:52:53.320 --> 01:52:54.360
uh

01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:55.180
and it says like

01:52:55.180 --> 01:52:56.300
drag item here

01:52:56.300 --> 01:52:57.740
uh

01:52:57.740 --> 01:52:59.360
I gotta

01:52:59.360 --> 01:53:00.160
I gotta try this

01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:00.420
no

01:53:00.420 --> 01:53:01.900
we'll do this way

01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:03.960
all right

01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:04.580
roll the one

01:53:04.580 --> 01:53:05.980
oh my gosh

01:53:05.980 --> 01:53:07.320
that is

01:53:07.320 --> 01:53:07.660
ass

01:53:07.660 --> 01:53:08.240
would you

01:53:08.240 --> 01:53:09.040
would you

01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:09.700
like

01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:11.220
to use a hero point

01:53:11.220 --> 01:53:12.900
yeah

01:53:12.900 --> 01:53:14.780
now would be the time

01:53:14.780 --> 01:53:15.520
to use a hero

01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:22.220
in which case

01:53:22.220 --> 01:53:23.700
so I'm just going to

01:53:23.700 --> 01:53:27.040
I'm gonna

01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:28.220
click on the button

01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:29.180
for the hero point

01:53:29.180 --> 01:53:30.580
I'm going to

01:53:30.580 --> 01:53:31.600
get out of here

01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:33.340
and go back

01:53:33.340 --> 01:53:34.700
to the craft

01:53:34.700 --> 01:53:36.660
actually

01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:38.040
at this point

01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:39.800
at this point

01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:40.080
Ram

01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:40.780
or at

01:53:40.780 --> 01:53:41.580
not Ramsey

01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:42.200
at this point

01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:42.540
Jason

01:53:42.540 --> 01:53:44.520
I'd say you don't even

01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:45.480
need a roll on this

01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:46.640
you just spend the hero point

01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:47.720
and you're able to do it

01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:48.600
um

01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:49.320
because

01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:50.740
as long as

01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:51.480
I roll a one

01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:52.520
I still get a 10

01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:53.680
yeah

01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:55.100
you rolled a one

01:53:55.100 --> 01:53:55.940
and you got a 10

01:53:55.940 --> 01:53:56.540
so

01:53:56.540 --> 01:53:57.060
right

01:53:57.060 --> 01:53:58.320
you just need to not

01:53:58.320 --> 01:53:58.980
roll a one

01:53:58.980 --> 01:54:00.060
and I'm not gonna

01:54:00.060 --> 01:54:01.260
we

01:54:01.260 --> 01:54:02.520
we'll say you just

01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:03.460
didn't roll a one

01:54:03.460 --> 01:54:04.960
I didn't roll a one

01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:05.320
yay

01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:07.020
so

01:54:07.020 --> 01:54:07.840
with your

01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:09.240
with your knowledge of

01:54:09.240 --> 01:54:10.580
with your knowledge of metal

01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:11.800
and your knowledge of crafting

01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:12.740
you're able to

01:54:12.740 --> 01:54:13.900
find the right

01:54:13.900 --> 01:54:15.720
section of the chain

01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:17.140
in order to be able to

01:54:17.140 --> 01:54:18.120
um

01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:19.380
in order to be able to

01:54:19.380 --> 01:54:20.540
cause the chain

01:54:20.540 --> 01:54:21.640
to just break

01:54:21.640 --> 01:54:23.180
allowing the dwarf

01:54:23.180 --> 01:54:23.480
to

01:54:23.480 --> 01:54:24.660
to get free

01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:25.760
um

01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:28.480
so

01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:29.300
and

01:54:29.300 --> 01:54:30.180
with that

01:54:30.180 --> 01:54:30.880
you have

01:54:30.880 --> 01:54:31.860
one more action

01:54:31.860 --> 01:54:32.860
that you can spend

01:54:32.860 --> 01:54:33.560
to

01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:34.300
um

01:54:34.300 --> 01:54:36.100
get back

01:54:36.100 --> 01:54:36.560
with your

01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:37.320
with your group

01:54:37.320 --> 01:54:37.560
or

01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:37.820
or

01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:38.640
or something like that

01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:40.940
if that's what you want to do

01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:41.180
yeah

01:54:41.180 --> 01:54:42.400
I definitely want to get back

01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:43.500
to the climbing

01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:48.500
it won't let me move my guy

01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:49.680
what am I doing wrong

01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:52.020
um

01:54:52.020 --> 01:54:53.180
it should let you

01:54:53.180 --> 01:55:00.180
move your guy

01:55:00.180 --> 01:55:00.640
but

01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:01.140
I'll

01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:03.280
move him for ya

01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:03.640
whatever

01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:04.240
thanks

01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:05.120
there you go

01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:06.720
good enough

01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:07.440
yeah

01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:09.320
I don't know why you can't move him

01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:09.640
like

01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:11.360
should be able to

01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:12.120
it started

01:55:12.120 --> 01:55:13.320
for some

01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:13.580
I

01:55:13.580 --> 01:55:14.340
I must have

01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:15.680
I don't know what I did

01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:17.160
yeah

01:55:17.160 --> 01:55:18.780
I don't know

01:55:18.780 --> 01:55:19.260
we'll see

01:55:19.260 --> 01:55:20.920
alright

01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:21.740
um

01:55:21.740 --> 01:55:22.820
this guy's

01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:24.600
uh

01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:24.940
the

01:55:24.940 --> 01:55:25.620
the

01:55:25.620 --> 01:55:27.680
big

01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:28.620
ogre warrior

01:55:28.620 --> 01:55:29.620
runs out

01:55:29.620 --> 01:55:30.320
and starts

01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:30.860
yelling

01:55:30.860 --> 01:55:31.480
water

01:55:31.480 --> 01:55:32.520
water

01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:34.960

01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:48.900
and

01:55:48.900 --> 01:55:49.500

01:56:00.260 --> 01:56:00.680
actually

01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:01.500
at this point

01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:02.440
we'll just

01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:04.080
end the combat

01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:05.180
um

01:56:05.180 --> 01:56:05.960
cause

01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:06.700
at this point

01:56:06.700 --> 01:56:07.240
really

01:56:07.240 --> 01:56:14.520
guys have to do is get up the uh get up the the climb up the thing so we'll just go ahead and

01:56:15.080 --> 01:56:29.720
end the combat um and you guys all through various ways and various means make it up

01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:41.780
to the top here the dwarf that you freed does actually make it out um and he follows you guys up

01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:51.540
um he says thank you i i don't know what what might have happened to me if you hadn't have saved me

01:56:51.540 --> 01:56:58.360
oh uh yes of course and the entire time

01:56:58.360 --> 01:56:59.380
and

01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:07.400
i might have known that you i might have known that the uh that that the great heroes

01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:12.600
demlor ergen and rurik were behind this rescue

01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:18.280
yeah

01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:26.480
is that suspicious because that sounds suspicious

01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:28.900
it's not suspicious

01:57:28.900 --> 01:57:29.700
okay

01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:29.720
okay

01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:34.040
you guys are we started at third level we

01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:39.800
were already big damn heroes yeah that's right you guys were already known within the uh within the

01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:44.280
within the halls of iron holds so yeah yeah excellent

01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:53.720
excellent you are maybe not the biggest heroes but your names are known yes yes

01:57:56.280 --> 01:57:59.480
i'm assuming i snagged one at least

01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:00.560
maybe one

01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:03.680
of the ones there that I was trying to get

01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:05.440
before you so viciously attacked me?

01:58:06.140 --> 01:58:07.520
No, you 100%

01:58:07.520 --> 01:58:10.020
the palm and object

01:58:10.020 --> 01:58:12.040
roll was not whether or not

01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:13.160
you were able to get

01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:15.660
the weapons and things that you needed.

01:58:15.860 --> 01:58:17.400
You 100% got those.

01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:20.000
It was just a question about whether or not you were

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:21.240
noticed. So,

01:58:21.880 --> 01:58:23.040
you got everything that you needed.

01:58:23.880 --> 01:58:26.060
Okay. I will quickly

01:58:26.060 --> 01:58:27.660
hand him a weapon.

01:58:29.720 --> 01:58:31.820
All right.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:33.760
He will gladly accept it.

01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:38.180
And then you guys

01:58:38.180 --> 01:58:40.340
run real quick over there

01:58:40.340 --> 01:58:42.080
over to the

01:58:42.080 --> 01:58:43.240
cages.

01:58:47.900 --> 01:58:50.340
The rest of

01:58:50.340 --> 01:58:51.600
the

01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:54.480
ogres, with the exception of the

01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:55.380
guards,

01:58:58.380 --> 01:58:59.380
are running

01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:00.940
towards the

01:59:00.940 --> 01:59:04.240
tent.

01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:08.100
So,

01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:12.260
Okay.

01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:13.880
Excellent.

01:59:14.120 --> 01:59:14.440
Excellent.

01:59:15.420 --> 01:59:18.260
Just like we drew

01:59:18.260 --> 01:59:18.660
it up.

01:59:23.500 --> 01:59:24.420
Any

01:59:24.420 --> 01:59:26.180
suggestions

01:59:26.180 --> 01:59:28.160
on who the inside informant

01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:29.480
is? I ask while we're,

01:59:29.720 --> 01:59:31.040
uh, jogging our way over there.

01:59:31.940 --> 01:59:33.920
Oh, good question.

01:59:49.580 --> 01:59:50.780
That is a good question.

01:59:55.700 --> 01:59:58.180
That will become another point of investigation.

01:59:58.180 --> 02:00:02.540
Yeah, yeah. Good call. Good call.

02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:12.600
All right. So, you guys make it over

02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:14.260
to the cage. Again,

02:00:14.760 --> 02:00:16.700
you see in the

02:00:16.700 --> 02:00:17.860
cage, there are

02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:20.540
roughly

02:00:20.540 --> 02:00:22.660
about 20 dwarves that are

02:00:22.660 --> 02:00:24.940
still in that cage.

02:00:25.980 --> 02:00:26.660
And then

02:00:26.660 --> 02:00:27.900
there are the two,

02:00:28.180 --> 02:00:29.680
and then there are the two ogres,

02:00:30.100 --> 02:00:30.920
um,

02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:33.980
that are standing

02:00:33.980 --> 02:00:34.440
guard.

02:00:36.500 --> 02:00:36.980
Excellent.

02:00:41.540 --> 02:00:42.120
All right.

02:00:42.200 --> 02:00:42.500
Well,

02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:47.000
you guys,

02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:47.780
all right.

02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:49.200
So, what are you going to do?

02:00:50.660 --> 02:00:52.040
First, are they looking

02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:53.180
in what direction?

02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:56.080
Um, well, they seem to be

02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:57.540
distracted at the moment.

02:00:57.540 --> 02:00:59.400
Um, they are looking more

02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:01.840
in the direction of the giant bonfire

02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:03.500
over the fence,

02:01:03.820 --> 02:01:05.680
um, and kind of out

02:01:05.680 --> 02:01:07.040
this way.

02:01:07.140 --> 02:01:09.360
They're not necessarily expecting anything

02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:10.820
from behind.

02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:13.640
Can you

02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:15.620
tell us what's the best way to ambush them?

02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:17.640
Well,

02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:19.660
that's your specialty. What's the best

02:01:19.660 --> 02:01:20.900
way to ambush them, Scott?

02:01:24.040 --> 02:01:25.660
I'll play ball. What do you want

02:01:25.660 --> 02:01:26.020
to do?

02:01:26.580 --> 02:01:27.460
Oh, Paul,

02:01:27.460 --> 02:01:29.460
is this cage, and

02:01:29.460 --> 02:01:31.480
how far down

02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:32.680
is it from the cliff we're on?

02:01:35.420 --> 02:01:37.420
Um, so you're looking at,

02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:39.500
like, you know, about 15 feet

02:01:39.500 --> 02:01:41.480
from the top of the cliff to

02:01:41.480 --> 02:01:43.280
the, to the,

02:01:43.360 --> 02:01:44.980
to the ground.

02:01:45.180 --> 02:01:47.520
The cage, you're looking at, like, a five-foot

02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:49.200
drop. The cage itself is about 15 feet.

02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:50.740
We're looking at these ogres, like,

02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:53.000
eye to eye right now.

02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:57.440
Yeah, they, they are pretty, uh,

02:01:57.520 --> 02:01:59.240
you're, you're, well, you're not looking at them

02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:01.280
eye to eye. You're looking at them, you know,

02:02:01.420 --> 02:02:03.260
eye to, eye to

02:02:03.260 --> 02:02:04.660
dome, but yeah.

02:02:05.500 --> 02:02:05.940
Yeah.

02:02:08.100 --> 02:02:09.220
Can we slide

02:02:09.220 --> 02:02:11.220
down this thing and climb

02:02:11.220 --> 02:02:12.440
the, uh, cage?

02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:14.140
Jump on?

02:02:15.900 --> 02:02:16.340
Yeah.

02:02:16.660 --> 02:02:18.860
We can probably just jump on the cage from here.

02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:21.360
You could even try and jump on

02:02:21.360 --> 02:02:23.280
the cage. I mean, some of you

02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:24.360
could jump on the cage.

02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:27.260
Some of you are not very athletic.

02:02:27.460 --> 02:02:28.980
I mean, I

02:02:28.980 --> 02:02:30.900
like the range

02:02:30.900 --> 02:02:33.480
I am in right here, so, uh,

02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:34.300
probably.

02:02:39.300 --> 02:02:41.680
I think we can open the cage

02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:43.320
and get him back up

02:02:43.320 --> 02:02:45.240
the thing without having to deal with these

02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:46.660
orcs. Orcs, right?

02:02:47.900 --> 02:02:48.420
Ogres.

02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:50.360
Ogres, yeah.

02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:53.260
Uh, there's a chance that you'd

02:02:53.260 --> 02:02:55.040
be able to do that, but, um,

02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:56.320
they, I mean,

02:02:57.460 --> 02:02:59.920
it just depends on how

02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:01.760
quiet you think

02:03:01.760 --> 02:03:04.240
that all of these 20 dwarves

02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:04.780
can be.

02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:07.620
Yeah, I, I

02:03:07.620 --> 02:03:09.860
not real sure

02:03:09.860 --> 02:03:11.280
I'm stealth at this point.

02:03:12.740 --> 02:03:13.340
Right.

02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:14.160
Right.

02:03:15.980 --> 02:03:17.820
But, you, but,

02:03:17.900 --> 02:03:19.740
like, I mean, honestly, Scott, like,

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:21.900
if you have a particular way

02:03:21.900 --> 02:03:23.900
that you see, you see you want

02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:25.680
to ambush them and that kind of thing,

02:03:25.780 --> 02:03:27.440
you can totally, you can,

02:03:27.460 --> 02:03:29.160
you can totally do that, and I'll, and I'll

02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:29.800
give you a,

02:03:30.740 --> 02:03:33.300
I'll, I'll let you, I'll let your, do your

02:03:33.300 --> 02:03:35.480
ambush thing. Yeah, I just

02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:37.260
don't want them to run towards

02:03:37.260 --> 02:03:39.260
the guy with the big horn, you know,

02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:39.840
so.

02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:43.020
Yeah, that's true. I don't know why they

02:03:43.020 --> 02:03:44.740
won't if you kill them dead.

02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:46.600
Right.

02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:49.260
I mean, you made

02:03:49.260 --> 02:03:51.180
pretty, you made pretty light

02:03:51.180 --> 02:03:53.100
work, uh,

02:03:53.160 --> 02:03:55.120
of the, of that one

02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:57.160
over, which was, which was

02:03:57.160 --> 02:03:58.360
an elite warrior.

02:03:59.320 --> 02:04:01.320
Yeah, it was, I was expecting

02:04:01.320 --> 02:04:03.140
these guys are must a few more

02:04:03.140 --> 02:04:03.520
rounds.

02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:06.880
Yeah.

02:04:08.020 --> 02:04:09.340
Yeah, so just,

02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:11.320
just to give you a little bit of an

02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:13.180
idea, the, the one that you dropped

02:04:13.180 --> 02:04:15.300
was an elite warrior. These guys are mooks.

02:04:16.180 --> 02:04:17.520
They have significantly

02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:19.040
fewer hit points and

02:04:19.040 --> 02:04:21.020
significantly lower defenses than

02:04:21.020 --> 02:04:22.520
the other guy, so

02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:25.280
I wouldn't base how long it would take

02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:26.300
you to drop one.

02:04:26.300 --> 02:04:27.140
I wouldn't base,

02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:27.740
based off of that guy.

02:04:28.580 --> 02:04:28.760
Yeah.

02:04:32.540 --> 02:04:32.940
Um.

02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:34.800
Yeah, I'd like to try to drop, to

02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:36.880
get to drop on them

02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:39.200
and attack them before

02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:40.300
they see us somehow.

02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:42.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:04:43.200 --> 02:04:44.080
No, absolutely.

02:04:45.040 --> 02:04:47.000
I can help you get down

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.340
if you want to

02:04:49.340 --> 02:04:50.120
try and climb down there.

02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:53.000
I was thinking of jumping on the cage and then jumping on him

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:53.700
somehow.

02:04:54.700 --> 02:04:55.140
Okay.

02:04:56.400 --> 02:04:56.760
Um,

02:04:57.160 --> 02:05:01.560
really, all that I'll need from, all that, all that I'll need from you for that is a stealth

02:05:01.560 --> 02:05:10.360
roll with your, with your, um, athletics at what it is, um, you, that's an easy jump for

02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:11.360
you.

02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:21.160
So, whereas I might make Rurik make a roll, you, you can just do it.

02:05:21.160 --> 02:05:26.040
Can I hunt prey and all that stuff before I attack somebody or no?

02:05:26.040 --> 02:05:27.040
Oh yeah.

02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:29.040
Okay.

02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:33.360
You, that's the advantage of getting the drop on everybody.

02:05:33.800 --> 02:05:35.800
It's like you can do all your preparation.

02:05:36.340 --> 02:05:36.520
Woo!

02:05:37.220 --> 02:05:37.780
Okay.

02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:40.880
Um.

02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:42.980
So that's your

02:05:42.980 --> 02:05:43.640
combat.

02:05:44.760 --> 02:05:44.880
Yeah.

02:05:45.340 --> 02:05:45.800
All right.

02:05:45.940 --> 02:05:48.860
So, Hergen, you get over here.

02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:50.840
Um.

02:05:53.100 --> 02:05:53.660
And

02:05:53.660 --> 02:05:57.020
Demler, uh,

02:05:57.040 --> 02:05:58.460
what is your plan?

02:06:02.540 --> 02:06:04.320
I was going to.

02:06:06.920 --> 02:06:09.160
He is Hergen labeled Scott.

02:06:09.540 --> 02:06:20.820
Look, uh, I'm, I'm in range for a magnetic pinions.

02:06:22.480 --> 02:06:22.980
Mm-hmm.

02:06:25.740 --> 02:06:26.800
And I thought I might.

02:06:27.040 --> 02:06:43.540
Oh, I'm not going to do that.

02:06:43.540 --> 02:06:47.100
Um, I'm going to do like the metal gate.

02:06:47.100 --> 02:06:48.100
Okay.

02:06:48.100 --> 02:06:49.100
That's going to work.

02:06:49.100 --> 02:06:50.100
Yeah.

02:06:50.100 --> 02:06:51.100
That's going to work.

02:06:51.100 --> 02:06:52.100
That's going to work.

02:06:52.100 --> 02:06:53.100
That's going to work.

02:06:53.100 --> 02:06:54.100
That's going to work.

02:06:54.100 --> 02:06:55.100
That's going to work.

02:06:55.100 --> 02:06:56.100
Yeah.

02:06:56.100 --> 02:06:56.600
Yeah.

02:06:57.040 --> 02:06:58.040
Yeah.

02:06:58.040 --> 02:06:59.040
Yeah.

02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:00.040
I don't think that's going to work.

02:07:00.040 --> 02:07:05.040
Um, anyway, I thought I might do the, um, magnetic pinions thing.

02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:06.040
Um.

02:07:06.040 --> 02:07:07.040
Okay.

02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:17.040
I was going to target those two guys, uh, after other attacks have been made.

02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:18.040
Okay.

02:07:18.040 --> 02:07:24.920
Now, like, so, and, and this one goes for, um, Eric as well.

02:07:24.920 --> 02:07:25.920
Um.

02:07:25.920 --> 02:07:26.920
Oh, shit.

02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:40.020
This is your, this is your opportunity to, um, this is your opportunity to do any preparation

02:07:40.020 --> 02:07:44.920
before I make your roll initiative and do your thing.

02:07:44.920 --> 02:07:45.920
So.

02:07:45.920 --> 02:07:46.920
Gotcha.

02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:47.920
Gotcha.

02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:49.920
Do you have anything that you need prep?

02:07:49.920 --> 02:07:52.920
Uh, I mean, not really.

02:07:52.920 --> 02:07:55.920
No, I want to, I mean, I guess I want to get in a hiding spot.

02:07:55.920 --> 02:07:59.920
Cause you know, that's how I do, but that should be easy enough.

02:07:59.920 --> 02:08:00.920
Sure.

02:08:00.920 --> 02:08:02.920
I imagine there's a tree or a bush or something to hide behind right here.

02:08:02.920 --> 02:08:03.920
Right.

02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:04.920
Okay.

02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:05.920
Cool.

02:08:05.920 --> 02:08:06.920
I think.

02:08:06.920 --> 02:08:07.920
Well, I will.

02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:08.920
I might need.

02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:09.920
Make sure my weapon is drawn, but.

02:08:09.920 --> 02:08:10.920
Cool.

02:08:10.920 --> 02:08:11.920
Check.

02:08:11.920 --> 02:08:12.920
Yeah.

02:08:12.920 --> 02:08:13.920
I need to draw my weapons maybe, but.

02:08:13.920 --> 02:08:14.920
Yep.

02:08:14.920 --> 02:08:15.920
Okay.

02:08:15.920 --> 02:08:16.920
I don't know where my guy is.

02:08:16.920 --> 02:08:17.920
I don't even see my guy.

02:08:17.920 --> 02:08:18.920
Yeah.

02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:19.920
I don't see my people either.

02:08:19.920 --> 02:08:20.920
Okay.

02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:21.920
Uh, you guys are on the edge.

02:08:21.920 --> 02:08:22.920
Um.

02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:23.920
Oh.

02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:24.920
Okay.

02:08:24.920 --> 02:08:25.920
Oh.

02:08:25.920 --> 02:08:26.920
Are you invisible?

02:08:26.920 --> 02:08:27.920
Yeah.

02:08:27.920 --> 02:08:28.920
There we go.

02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:29.920
I don't want to see people now.

02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:30.920
What the hell?

02:08:30.920 --> 02:08:31.920
Very good.

02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:32.920
I might, um.

02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:33.920
Oh my gosh.

02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:34.920
Um.

02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:35.920
I might try and follow Kurgan's example.

02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:36.920
Do I want to do that?

02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:37.920
No.

02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:38.920
No.

02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:39.920
No.

02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:40.920
No.

02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:41.920
No.

02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:42.920
No.

02:08:42.920 --> 02:08:43.920
No.

02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:44.920
No.

02:08:44.920 --> 02:08:45.920
No.

02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:46.920
No.

02:08:46.920 --> 02:08:47.920
No.

02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:48.920
No.

02:08:48.920 --> 02:08:49.920
No.

02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:50.920
No.

02:08:50.920 --> 02:08:51.920
No.

02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:52.920
No.

02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:53.920
No.

02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:54.920
No.

02:08:54.920 --> 02:08:55.920
No.

02:08:55.920 --> 02:08:56.920
No.

02:08:56.920 --> 02:08:57.920
No.

02:08:57.920 --> 02:08:58.920
No.

02:08:58.920 --> 02:08:59.920
No.

02:08:59.920 --> 02:09:00.920
I don't know.

02:09:00.920 --> 02:09:02.920
I was debating about trying to work some of these steel bars into non-existence.

02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:03.920
Also.

02:09:03.920 --> 02:09:16.120
It looks like that cage has got some metal in it that I could maybe weaken or something.

02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:17.120
Possibly.

02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:24.500
To make it easier to get the door open or the guys out or something so I wanted

02:09:24.500 --> 02:09:25.380
give that a go

02:09:25.380 --> 02:09:27.620
as well

02:09:27.620 --> 02:09:30.300
okay well

02:09:30.300 --> 02:09:32.540
anything that is going to be an

02:09:32.540 --> 02:09:34.620
offensive thing will need to

02:09:34.620 --> 02:09:36.080
handle in combat

02:09:36.080 --> 02:09:36.820
so

02:09:36.820 --> 02:09:40.660
anything that you want to do for that

02:09:40.660 --> 02:09:41.840
sort of thing will

02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:44.540
roll initiative

02:09:44.540 --> 02:09:46.720
it's just more long lines

02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:48.680
of like what sort of preparatory things

02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:50.660
do you want to do before the

02:09:50.660 --> 02:09:51.500
action begins

02:09:51.500 --> 02:09:53.400
I think my

02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:56.800
I think everything is all pulled up

02:09:56.800 --> 02:09:58.580
you know so I think I'm ready to go

02:09:58.580 --> 02:10:00.600
okay you're comfortable

02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:01.560
with where you're sitting

02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:03.100
Dimmler

02:10:03.100 --> 02:10:07.180
what the heck

02:10:07.180 --> 02:10:12.540
I don't know

02:10:12.540 --> 02:10:13.200
anyway

02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:16.460
alright so

02:10:16.460 --> 02:10:17.640
Hergen I already

02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:20.960
Hergen I took your

02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:23.060
sneak score and just made

02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:24.800
it your

02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:25.940
initiative

02:10:25.940 --> 02:10:28.700
it was a really good one

02:10:28.700 --> 02:10:30.980
so you don't need a roll initiative but I need

02:10:30.980 --> 02:10:32.880
an initiative from both Rurik

02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:33.580
and Dimmler

02:10:33.580 --> 02:10:37.020
you can use sneak if you want to

02:10:37.020 --> 02:10:39.140
or you can do

02:10:39.140 --> 02:10:39.940
perception

02:10:39.940 --> 02:10:46.460
sweet

02:10:46.460 --> 02:10:52.980
alright

02:10:53.400 --> 02:11:00.200
a five or under

02:11:00.200 --> 02:11:01.380
a five and a six

02:11:01.380 --> 02:11:04.060
what do you mean not a five or under

02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:06.040
my roll

02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:07.220
oh

02:11:07.220 --> 02:11:10.480
I rolled better than a five

02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:11.280
you'll

02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:13.120
have to be happy

02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:15.260
alright

02:11:15.260 --> 02:11:17.160
good

02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:19.300
alright these

02:11:19.300 --> 02:11:21.520
were definitely caught with their pants

02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:21.900
down

02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:22.960
so

02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:26.500
So, Rurik, you're good to go.

02:11:26.680 --> 02:11:27.500
Like I like him.

02:11:27.500 --> 02:11:28.300
I started off.

02:11:28.420 --> 02:11:29.180
That's weird.

02:11:29.860 --> 02:11:30.300
All right, cool.

02:11:33.300 --> 02:11:38.920
Yeah, I don't see any reason to do anything else this turn.

02:11:40.420 --> 02:11:42.300
We will...

02:11:42.300 --> 02:11:43.340
That guy's 40 foot.

02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:44.560
That guy's 50 foot.

02:11:45.740 --> 02:11:46.760
Aye, Hargan.

02:11:47.640 --> 02:11:50.300
Hargan can take that guy out in one round, I believe.

02:11:50.300 --> 02:11:51.120
I believe.

02:11:51.580 --> 02:11:53.880
We're going to target this ogre down here.

02:11:53.880 --> 02:11:55.880
And we are going to...

02:11:57.400 --> 02:11:59.760
Waka waka.

02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:00.200
Oh, wait.

02:12:00.420 --> 02:12:01.500
Things are already drawn.

02:12:02.940 --> 02:12:04.800
We will load...

02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:05.640
Let's load...

02:12:05.640 --> 02:12:07.380
Let's have fire loaded in here.

02:12:07.720 --> 02:12:12.280
Save the cold for the things I want cold for.

02:12:14.020 --> 02:12:18.000
And then we shall strike.

02:12:19.080 --> 02:12:19.880
First.

02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:21.040
Some reason.

02:12:23.240 --> 02:12:27.500
That's still not understanding that I have a plus two to hit.

02:12:27.620 --> 02:12:28.700
So we're going to add that.

02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:31.380
And we will roll away.

02:12:35.780 --> 02:12:36.460
Kapow.

02:12:37.140 --> 02:12:37.780
Nice.

02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:38.220
Kapow.

02:12:38.220 --> 02:12:39.080
Seems good.

02:12:40.180 --> 02:12:40.780
Kapow.

02:12:41.480 --> 02:12:43.040
Oh, this is going to do...

02:12:43.860 --> 02:12:47.340
This is going to do a stupid amount of damage.

02:12:47.820 --> 02:12:50.060
So firearms, funnily enough,

02:12:50.060 --> 02:12:50.220
in this game, it's going to be a lot of damage.

02:12:50.220 --> 02:12:50.280
It's going to be a lot of damage.

02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:52.280
In this game, their normal damage

02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:54.320
is not much higher than, you know,

02:12:54.380 --> 02:12:55.780
like a bow or something.

02:12:56.020 --> 02:12:58.340
But they get extra critical damage, is what they do.

02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:01.560
So...

02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:03.260
That didn't seem like a whole lot.

02:13:03.720 --> 02:13:04.320
That's all right.

02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:05.780
That was a whole lot.

02:13:07.420 --> 02:13:08.620
Oh my gosh.

02:13:12.300 --> 02:13:14.760
You done killed him in one shot.

02:13:15.960 --> 02:13:18.480
As if he needs persistent damage.

02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:21.480
Uh, cool.

02:13:22.140 --> 02:13:24.880
Um, I guess for action two,

02:13:25.260 --> 02:13:26.740
we're going to hide again

02:13:26.740 --> 02:13:29.220
and reload at the same time

02:13:29.220 --> 02:13:30.500
because that's how we do.

02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:32.700
Um...

02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:36.180
So I will roll a stealth here.

02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:40.100
And then I may as well take a shot at this dude

02:13:40.100 --> 02:13:41.060
for my third action

02:13:41.060 --> 02:13:42.820
because what else am I going to do, right?

02:13:43.660 --> 02:13:44.620
Why not?

02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:46.280
Why not?

02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:47.280
All right.

02:13:47.320 --> 02:13:50.040
This is at the neg five.

02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:52.440
Um...

02:13:52.440 --> 02:13:56.900
Two.

02:13:57.020 --> 02:13:58.680
Don't forget to add that.

02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:00.040
And...

02:14:00.040 --> 02:14:01.740
Fire.

02:14:05.100 --> 02:14:07.740
Um, and I'm also not sure

02:14:07.740 --> 02:14:10.280
if it got the...

02:14:12.140 --> 02:14:13.420
I don't think it matters.

02:14:13.940 --> 02:14:15.060
But if it got the...

02:14:15.060 --> 02:14:15.900
No, it does not.

02:14:15.900 --> 02:14:17.580
...the minus two.

02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:17.920
Okay.

02:14:18.220 --> 02:14:18.420
Okay.

02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:20.220
I assume it doesn't matter.

02:14:20.220 --> 02:14:20.860
It doesn't matter in this case.

02:14:21.820 --> 02:14:23.000
No, it does not matter in this case.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:24.640
If their AC was that low,

02:14:24.780 --> 02:14:25.640
that would be terrible.

02:14:26.100 --> 02:14:26.720
Uh, oh wait.

02:14:26.820 --> 02:14:27.620
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:29.560
Uh, I need to toggle off

02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:32.360
one shot, one kill.

02:14:32.660 --> 02:14:34.340
Uh, because that only applies

02:14:34.340 --> 02:14:36.500
to my first attack.

02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:36.940
Okay.

02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:37.980
It's toggled off.

02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:40.460
It does not do that automatically.

02:14:42.740 --> 02:14:44.460
Oh, nice damage still.

02:14:44.580 --> 02:14:46.040
I will take it.

02:14:49.460 --> 02:14:49.980
Jeez.

02:14:49.980 --> 02:14:51.260
Maxed on a...

02:14:51.260 --> 02:14:51.580
Oh!

02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:53.000
Oh!

02:14:54.780 --> 02:14:56.720
Yeah, I bet he's not feeling good.

02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:01.400
He's on fire.

02:15:03.020 --> 02:15:05.560
No two ogres are not on fire.

02:15:09.420 --> 02:15:09.980
Okay.

02:15:10.700 --> 02:15:11.100
All right.

02:15:11.100 --> 02:15:11.460
Now.

02:15:16.460 --> 02:15:16.900
Now...

02:15:16.900 --> 02:15:18.100
Uh, well...

02:15:19.460 --> 02:15:19.780
Ergen.

02:15:19.980 --> 02:15:22.320
Now, Ergen, your, your, your turn.

02:15:23.220 --> 02:15:23.900
Your turn.

02:15:25.640 --> 02:15:26.240
Get him.

02:15:26.300 --> 02:15:27.560
I guess I'll jump down.

02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:27.820
All right.

02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:44.760
Nice.

02:15:45.020 --> 02:15:45.160
Hey.

02:15:46.600 --> 02:15:47.440
It's okay.

02:15:48.860 --> 02:15:49.140
Yep.

02:15:49.980 --> 02:15:55.620
Oh, good damage, too.

02:15:56.760 --> 02:15:57.860
Very good damage.

02:15:59.620 --> 02:16:00.740
Very good damage.

02:16:01.580 --> 02:16:01.920
Boom.

02:16:05.420 --> 02:16:06.060
Excellent.

02:16:07.160 --> 02:16:08.080
That's beautiful.

02:16:09.080 --> 02:16:09.380
Yep.

02:16:09.660 --> 02:16:10.220
One round.

02:16:11.020 --> 02:16:11.440
All right.

02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:14.420
Now, let's go take out...

02:16:14.420 --> 02:16:16.560
Remember how you guys were agonizing

02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:19.960
over how you were going to sneak around these?

02:16:19.960 --> 02:16:20.960
These guys?

02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:26.060
That was a lot of guys.

02:16:26.900 --> 02:16:28.160
Uh, all right.

02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:28.480
Cool.

02:16:28.940 --> 02:16:29.800
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

02:16:31.080 --> 02:16:31.480
All right.

02:16:31.540 --> 02:16:37.920
So you guys, you guys very quickly, um, use the chaos around you and take out these two

02:16:37.920 --> 02:16:39.180
guards very easily.

02:16:39.860 --> 02:16:43.960
Um, you are able to, um...

02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:44.440
Um.

02:16:49.060 --> 02:16:49.580
Woo.

02:16:49.960 --> 02:16:56.640
Well the, the dwarf that, the dwarf that was in chains basically kind of scuttles down

02:16:56.640 --> 02:17:04.260
the, scuttles down the, the thing, um, and starts trying to un, unlock the, uh, unlock

02:17:04.260 --> 02:17:05.260
the cage.

02:17:05.260 --> 02:17:08.840
Um, what are the rest of you doing?

02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:09.840
Hm.

02:17:09.840 --> 02:17:13.900
Uh, but he's getting the cage.

02:17:13.900 --> 02:17:18.380
I want to make sure Horn guy is, uh, not a problem anymore.

02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:20.320
Okay.

02:17:20.780 --> 02:17:23.480
So I'm going to hop down into the cage

02:17:23.480 --> 02:17:25.120
and then get down here.

02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:29.960
And I will make my way.

02:17:31.800 --> 02:17:34.040
Honestly, I rather think we would do well

02:17:34.040 --> 02:17:34.940
to sneak over to the other dwarves.

02:17:34.940 --> 02:17:35.840
Or just leave them alone.

02:17:37.060 --> 02:17:37.580
Yeah.

02:17:37.860 --> 02:17:38.580
Oh, there's other dwarves.

02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:40.940
Oh, there's more dwarves in this cage?

02:17:41.540 --> 02:17:42.600
Yeah, I think so.

02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:44.160
Oh.

02:17:44.940 --> 02:17:46.180
I didn't think so.

02:17:46.200 --> 02:17:46.500
Is there?

02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:48.940
No, there aren't.

02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:49.680
There aren't.

02:17:49.680 --> 02:17:50.960
There's only one location.

02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:52.820
There's only one location, yeah.

02:17:54.200 --> 02:17:56.060
This is a battle map,

02:17:56.160 --> 02:18:00.080
so I can't really control everything that's on here.

02:18:00.600 --> 02:18:02.780
So this is...

02:18:03.560 --> 02:18:07.280
Where you guys are is where all the dwarves are.

02:18:07.900 --> 02:18:08.780
Okay, okay.

02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:10.180
I think you might be right, though.

02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:12.900
I think our best avenue of getting out of here

02:18:12.900 --> 02:18:17.100
is to go to that eastern, get out that way.

02:18:17.420 --> 02:18:19.080
Because I'm not certain these dwarves

02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:19.660
are going to be...

02:18:19.680 --> 02:18:21.120
I don't know if there's any good climbers

02:18:21.120 --> 02:18:22.200
up this cliff here.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:23.340
I don't know.

02:18:23.360 --> 02:18:24.680
Maybe we can help them, but...

02:18:26.680 --> 02:18:30.120
We may have to sneak off to the east.

02:18:31.580 --> 02:18:32.120
I don't know.

02:18:32.140 --> 02:18:32.440
We'll see.

02:18:33.540 --> 02:18:35.760
So yeah, horned guy we may not even have to worry about

02:18:35.760 --> 02:18:37.180
at this point, honestly.

02:18:38.880 --> 02:18:40.660
Anywhere we go, there's a cliff, though.

02:18:42.440 --> 02:18:42.840
So...

02:18:42.840 --> 02:18:43.400
Yeah.

02:18:43.700 --> 02:18:45.620
I mean, like, there's that open area

02:18:45.620 --> 02:18:47.440
at the very eastern edge.

02:18:48.680 --> 02:18:49.160
But...

02:18:49.680 --> 02:18:52.780
We'd have to move a whole group of dwarves

02:18:52.780 --> 02:18:54.580
right through here,

02:18:54.720 --> 02:18:56.520
which I don't know if we can do that

02:18:56.520 --> 02:18:57.420
very stealthily.

02:18:58.920 --> 02:19:00.680
I think...

02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:03.460
I think that I can help.

02:19:03.700 --> 02:19:04.960
I mean, like, with my climb thing,

02:19:05.040 --> 02:19:06.420
I think I can get everybody up

02:19:06.420 --> 02:19:08.220
the cliff.

02:19:08.940 --> 02:19:10.680
Yep, we've got rope. I've got rope.

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:13.000
I've got, um...

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.220
Can we push the cage over, too?

02:19:15.220 --> 02:19:15.640
No.

02:19:18.280 --> 02:19:19.400
I wouldn't fight it.

02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:21.060
No, I mean, that's a pretty massive cage.

02:19:22.500 --> 02:19:22.580
Okay.

02:19:24.960 --> 02:19:27.200
Maybe we could force some orcs to push it.

02:19:29.440 --> 02:19:31.400
I have, um...

02:19:32.100 --> 02:19:32.860
They're ogres.

02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:37.360
I have an ability

02:19:37.360 --> 02:19:38.220
to

02:19:38.220 --> 02:19:41.320
kind of do, like, a forest march,

02:19:41.700 --> 02:19:43.160
if you will.

02:19:45.160 --> 02:19:45.680
Okay.

02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:47.680
Um...

02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:51.400
Anyway, I can...

02:19:55.060 --> 02:19:56.920
If I can find it, anyway.

02:20:00.280 --> 02:20:00.880
Um...

02:20:00.880 --> 02:20:01.840
Let me see where I picked...

02:20:01.840 --> 02:20:02.260
Oh, yeah.

02:20:02.680 --> 02:20:03.560
Let's pick up the pace.

02:20:05.160 --> 02:20:05.680
Um...

02:20:05.680 --> 02:20:07.020
I can help others push themselves

02:20:07.020 --> 02:20:08.080
beyond their normal limits.

02:20:09.080 --> 02:20:09.640
Um...

02:20:09.640 --> 02:20:11.400
When hustling in a group...

02:20:12.740 --> 02:20:13.400
Um...

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.400
Whoever has the longest...

02:20:19.400 --> 02:20:24.400
You know, like, ability to move,

02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:27.400
I can get everybody in the group to move assets at that.

02:20:27.400 --> 02:20:28.400
Okay.

02:20:28.400 --> 02:20:29.400
So...

02:20:29.400 --> 02:20:37.400
We can kind of push them on out of here, I think, fairly quick.

02:20:37.400 --> 02:20:38.400
Okay.

02:20:38.400 --> 02:20:39.400
Okay.

02:20:39.400 --> 02:20:40.400
All right.

02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:41.400
Okay.

02:20:41.400 --> 02:20:42.400
All right.

02:20:42.400 --> 02:20:43.400
All right.

02:20:43.400 --> 02:20:44.400
All right.

02:20:44.400 --> 02:20:45.400
All right.

02:20:45.400 --> 02:20:46.400
All right.

02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:47.400
All right.

02:20:47.400 --> 02:20:48.400
All right.

02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:49.400
All right.

02:20:49.400 --> 02:20:50.400
I like it.

02:20:50.400 --> 02:20:55.400
Yeah, and we can...

02:20:55.400 --> 02:21:02.360
You guys can also utilize, like, following the expert, um, or sneaking to get through

02:21:02.360 --> 02:21:03.360
the...

02:21:03.360 --> 02:21:06.040
Through the camp.

02:21:06.040 --> 02:21:13.040
So as an exploration activity, um, which...

02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:17.480
I know we have at least one person who's an expert.

02:21:17.480 --> 02:21:18.560
Um...

02:21:19.400 --> 02:21:31.420
which would give everybody a plus 2

02:21:31.420 --> 02:21:32.260
on their sneaking

02:21:32.260 --> 02:21:38.080
that is expert

02:21:38.080 --> 02:21:44.460
when you get to master

02:21:44.460 --> 02:21:46.040
then it's a plus 3

02:21:46.040 --> 02:21:50.520
so

02:21:50.520 --> 02:21:56.120
okay so what's the

02:21:56.120 --> 02:21:57.680
what's the plan

02:21:57.680 --> 02:22:01.200
what's the plan here

02:22:01.200 --> 02:22:07.020
yeah

02:22:07.020 --> 02:22:11.000
I think that's a good idea

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:11.800
I've got some rope

02:22:11.800 --> 02:22:13.400
that can help

02:22:13.400 --> 02:22:15.320
you're an expert

02:22:15.320 --> 02:22:16.020
we got

02:22:16.020 --> 02:22:16.040
we got some rope

02:22:16.040 --> 02:22:17.020
got them out of here okay

02:22:17.020 --> 02:22:18.880
what condition are they in

02:22:18.880 --> 02:22:20.900
right

02:22:20.900 --> 02:22:24.920
like give some rudimentary

02:22:24.920 --> 02:22:26.120
treatment if necessary

02:22:26.120 --> 02:22:27.460
but I mean nothing in depth

02:22:27.460 --> 02:22:28.480
we don't have the time

02:22:28.480 --> 02:22:32.140
yeah they will need some looking after

02:22:32.140 --> 02:22:33.020
but

02:22:33.020 --> 02:22:36.040
they are definitely

02:22:36.920 --> 02:22:44.520
they're ecstatic

02:22:44.520 --> 02:22:45.240
but

02:22:45.240 --> 02:22:45.720
but

02:22:45.720 --> 02:22:46.020
but

02:22:46.020 --> 02:22:47.120
they can move up

02:22:47.120 --> 02:22:48.120
under their own power

02:22:48.120 --> 02:22:50.220
I guess is what I'm going for

02:22:50.220 --> 02:22:50.640
okay

02:22:50.640 --> 02:22:52.080
yeah yeah yeah

02:22:52.080 --> 02:22:52.500
all right

02:22:52.500 --> 02:22:54.960
but yeah

02:22:56.540 --> 02:22:57.480
they're not gonna move

02:22:57.480 --> 02:22:58.660
they're not gonna move fast

02:22:58.660 --> 02:22:59.120
unless

02:22:59.120 --> 02:23:00.160
unless rushed

02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:01.800
yep

02:23:01.800 --> 02:23:02.740
yep yep yep

02:23:02.740 --> 02:23:06.200
I hate to say it

02:23:06.200 --> 02:23:07.260
but we got some

02:23:07.260 --> 02:23:08.040
some rushing

02:23:08.040 --> 02:23:09.080
because it won't be

02:23:09.080 --> 02:23:10.920
we can figure it out

02:23:10.920 --> 02:23:11.340
yeah

02:23:12.100 --> 02:23:12.360
yeah

02:23:12.360 --> 02:23:13.280
okay so

02:23:13.280 --> 02:23:13.920
we need to put some minutes

02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:14.500
behind him

02:23:14.500 --> 02:23:16.000
okay so are you guys

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.140
guys going back up the cliff

02:23:18.140 --> 02:23:20.080
and out, or are you trying to

02:23:20.080 --> 02:23:22.200
cut across the camp and avoid

02:23:22.200 --> 02:23:22.720
notice?

02:23:25.720 --> 02:23:27.880
I think the plan is

02:23:27.880 --> 02:23:29.820
to try to get them

02:23:29.820 --> 02:23:32.140
up this cliff face between

02:23:32.140 --> 02:23:33.900
ropes and an expert climber,

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:35.840
and then just GTFO to the west.

02:23:37.040 --> 02:23:37.640
Is that

02:23:37.640 --> 02:23:38.420
right?

02:23:39.580 --> 02:23:42.200
Okay. So the west

02:23:42.200 --> 02:23:44.000
is the

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.140
opposite

02:23:46.140 --> 02:23:48.180
direction of Dagger Sheath.

02:23:50.320 --> 02:23:50.800
Okay.

02:23:51.480 --> 02:23:53.600
Well, at least

02:23:53.600 --> 02:23:55.320
directly west until we're

02:23:55.320 --> 02:23:56.540
out of the camp.

02:23:57.360 --> 02:23:58.920
No, absolutely.

02:23:59.260 --> 02:24:01.180
And no

02:24:01.180 --> 02:24:03.580
big deal on that. I just

02:24:03.580 --> 02:24:05.640
wanted to make sure that if you weren't thinking you were going to have to

02:24:05.640 --> 02:24:06.580
double back, then

02:24:06.580 --> 02:24:09.580
you are going to have to double back.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:11.780
Yeah, that's totally fine.

02:24:11.860 --> 02:24:13.080
I just want to get away

02:24:13.080 --> 02:24:13.980
first.

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:15.320
Okay.

02:24:16.180 --> 02:24:18.080
Alright, so let's just

02:24:18.080 --> 02:24:20.000
go ahead and have everybody roll their

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:20.360
stealth.

02:24:22.300 --> 02:24:22.660
Oh.

02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:28.140
Feels like Chris is trying to tell

02:24:28.140 --> 02:24:30.240
us go across. It's easier.

02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:31.720
No.

02:24:31.780 --> 02:24:32.540
No, I'm

02:24:32.540 --> 02:24:35.780
just bringing additional information

02:24:35.780 --> 02:24:37.980
into the thing.

02:24:38.100 --> 02:24:40.000
I'm not actually trying to tell you what to do.

02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:42.080
It's just kind

02:24:42.080 --> 02:24:42.860
of like as

02:24:42.860 --> 02:24:43.520
a

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.140
GM, sometimes I've got

02:24:46.140 --> 02:24:48.200
things in my brain that

02:24:48.200 --> 02:24:49.960
I maybe did not communicate

02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:52.260
to you guys, so I just

02:24:52.260 --> 02:24:54.260
offer clarifying points just

02:24:54.260 --> 02:24:55.920
to make sure that everybody knows

02:24:55.920 --> 02:24:56.580
Oh, look.

02:24:57.180 --> 02:24:59.260
I almost got over

02:24:59.260 --> 02:25:02.040
I got a six.

02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:03.580
I got over five again.

02:25:08.680 --> 02:25:10.540
I'm so proud of myself.

02:25:10.540 --> 02:25:12.540
I'm so proud of myself.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.500
Okay, so

02:25:16.500 --> 02:25:18.440
you guys hightail it

02:25:18.440 --> 02:25:20.500
up the cliff. You pull

02:25:20.500 --> 02:25:22.100
up all

02:25:22.100 --> 02:25:24.620
21 of the

02:25:24.620 --> 02:25:25.120
survivors

02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:28.460
and start hightailing it

02:25:28.460 --> 02:25:29.180
to the west.

02:25:31.340 --> 02:25:32.000
After a few

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:36.220
Go ahead and roll survival

02:25:36.220 --> 02:25:38.400
for anybody who wants to try to cover

02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:39.040
tracks.

02:25:40.940 --> 02:25:41.820
Probably not.

02:25:42.160 --> 02:25:43.800
Probably. Which is

02:25:43.800 --> 02:25:44.900
probably Hercan.

02:25:50.340 --> 02:25:53.120
All right.

02:25:54.460 --> 02:25:55.620
All right, so

02:25:55.620 --> 02:25:57.840
Hercan covers

02:25:57.840 --> 02:25:59.860
up the tracks as best he can.

02:26:00.400 --> 02:26:01.180
I mean, there are

02:26:01.180 --> 02:26:03.540
20 some odd dwarves, so

02:26:03.540 --> 02:26:05.940
24 dwarves,

02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:07.840
so he does

02:26:07.840 --> 02:26:08.460
what he can.

02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:11.840
I think you do a relatively good job.

02:26:11.840 --> 02:26:12.980
So, you know,

02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:16.160
maybe 24 dwarves looks like, you know.

02:26:17.340 --> 02:26:18.420
So, you guys

02:26:18.420 --> 02:26:20.260
head out. How far

02:26:20.260 --> 02:26:21.880
are you wanting to go west?

02:26:28.260 --> 02:26:29.420
Um, good

02:26:29.420 --> 02:26:31.300
question.

02:26:33.300 --> 02:26:34.060
Anybody know

02:26:34.060 --> 02:26:35.060
some local caves?

02:26:38.260 --> 02:26:38.420
Um,

02:26:43.800 --> 02:26:54.460
, technically nobody, nobody

02:26:54.460 --> 02:26:56.500
really knows this area very well.

02:26:56.680 --> 02:26:58.720
You may have known the area

02:26:58.720 --> 02:27:00.620
at one point,

02:27:00.720 --> 02:27:02.520
but that was before the fire.

02:27:02.740 --> 02:27:04.060
That was before the

02:27:04.060 --> 02:27:06.460
sky range

02:27:06.460 --> 02:27:08.520
fire, right?

02:27:10.980 --> 02:27:11.500
Yeah.

02:27:11.800 --> 02:27:13.340
Well, I think our

02:27:13.340 --> 02:27:16.140
primary goal

02:27:16.140 --> 02:27:17.760
at this point is

02:27:17.760 --> 02:27:19.220
get back to

02:27:19.220 --> 02:27:20.600
Yeah.

02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:22.620
Iron Hold, right?

02:27:23.560 --> 02:27:24.420
Yeah, we need to.

02:27:25.420 --> 02:27:27.300
Like, we got the dwarves, we got the plans,

02:27:27.480 --> 02:27:29.080
we need to let the king know what's up.

02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:32.100
Yeah, you do still have that

02:27:32.100 --> 02:27:33.640
you do still have the

02:27:33.640 --> 02:27:35.820
Captain Kale over by

02:27:35.820 --> 02:27:37.760
Stagger Sheath

02:27:37.760 --> 02:27:40.300
who's waiting for you as well.

02:27:40.300 --> 02:27:40.820
That's right.

02:27:41.480 --> 02:27:43.180
We do need to go pick him up.

02:27:43.340 --> 02:27:54.940
I think we would do well to circle back to him and even if we have to leave the better part of the dwarves with him.

02:27:55.940 --> 02:27:56.580
Uh-huh.

02:27:58.100 --> 02:27:59.640
You know, I think we have to do that.

02:28:01.160 --> 02:28:02.660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:28:03.700 --> 02:28:04.020
Okay.

02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:06.500
Because we got to get back.

02:28:06.500 --> 02:28:07.920
We got to get back home fast.

02:28:08.800 --> 02:28:09.940
Right, right.

02:28:10.020 --> 02:28:10.780
I don't trust.

02:28:10.780 --> 02:28:11.960
I don't trust that chick.

02:28:12.140 --> 02:28:13.320
I don't trust that other dude.

02:28:13.340 --> 02:28:16.260
I don't trust that other dude to be sending freak messages over magic.

02:28:17.480 --> 02:28:18.000
Sorry.

02:28:19.460 --> 02:28:21.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:25.580
I want to see King face-to-face.

02:28:27.060 --> 02:28:28.120
Yeah, yep, yep.

02:28:28.700 --> 02:28:30.440
Well, I think, yeah.

02:28:30.560 --> 02:28:33.800
So, step one, let's get back to the dude.

02:28:35.220 --> 02:28:35.960
So, I don't know.

02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:41.640
Whatever scouts they may have are going to be relatively close.

02:28:41.640 --> 02:28:43.320
I don't think we have to go too far out of our way.

02:28:43.340 --> 02:28:46.580
Like, they're going to be dealing with the immediate chaos for a minute

02:28:46.580 --> 02:28:48.520
before they start trying to look.

02:28:49.560 --> 02:28:51.660
So, I don't know.

02:28:53.540 --> 02:28:54.440
Okay, fine.

02:28:54.720 --> 02:28:57.940
Maybe not even 30 minutes west.

02:28:58.180 --> 02:28:58.600
I don't know.

02:28:58.920 --> 02:28:59.220
Okay.

02:28:59.440 --> 02:29:00.160
What do you guys think?

02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:03.720
Yeah, 5-10 minutes west.

02:29:04.360 --> 02:29:04.620
Yep.

02:29:05.940 --> 02:29:08.120
And then just kind of hike it from there.

02:29:09.140 --> 02:29:09.380
Okay.

02:29:10.160 --> 02:29:12.760
So, I'm going to need two more rolls.

02:29:12.760 --> 02:29:13.240
Okay.

02:29:13.240 --> 02:29:13.260
Okay.

02:29:13.260 --> 02:29:13.320
Okay.

02:29:13.320 --> 02:29:17.780
And then we'll call it, because we have hit 10 o'clock.

02:29:18.620 --> 02:29:19.160
Okie dokie.

02:29:20.180 --> 02:29:23.840
So, the first roll that I'm going to need is a survival roll

02:29:23.840 --> 02:29:30.980
to figure out if you guys can figure out how to make it back there.

02:29:31.100 --> 02:29:35.400
So, that seems like a Hergen roll.

02:29:39.920 --> 02:29:40.520
Yay.

02:29:41.200 --> 02:29:41.720
All right.

02:29:42.520 --> 02:29:43.280
Nicely done.

02:29:43.320 --> 02:29:54.440
And the second is, I'm going to need a sneaking roll to make sure that you were able to avoid

02:29:54.440 --> 02:29:57.160
any ogre scouts that were in the area.

02:29:58.560 --> 02:29:59.040
Uh-huh.

02:30:00.380 --> 02:30:02.000
I have sneaked my sneak.

02:30:03.360 --> 02:30:03.640
Yeah.

02:30:04.360 --> 02:30:05.800
Sounds like I sneaked good.

02:30:06.940 --> 02:30:09.120
You sneaked dang good.

02:30:09.260 --> 02:30:12.040
You rolled terrible, and you still sneaked good.

02:30:12.040 --> 02:30:16.700
I got like a plus 12, so.

02:30:17.320 --> 02:30:18.220
Oh, my gosh.

02:30:18.440 --> 02:30:18.700
Right?

02:30:19.880 --> 02:30:20.380
Okay.

02:30:21.820 --> 02:30:24.000
Free or better, you're in great shape.

02:30:25.180 --> 02:30:25.460
Yeah.

02:30:25.780 --> 02:30:26.320
Pretty much.

02:30:26.760 --> 02:30:27.240
Pretty much.

02:30:27.880 --> 02:30:28.400
All right.

02:30:28.580 --> 02:30:31.720
So, you are able to get all the way.

02:30:33.460 --> 02:30:41.040
You're able to make it all the way back to the location where Captain Kale is holding up.

02:30:41.040 --> 02:30:41.120
Okay.

02:30:41.120 --> 02:30:41.180
All right.

02:30:41.180 --> 02:30:41.220
All right.

02:30:41.220 --> 02:30:41.240
All right.

02:30:41.240 --> 02:30:41.280
All right.

02:30:41.280 --> 02:30:41.340
All right.

02:30:41.340 --> 02:30:41.380
All right.

02:30:41.380 --> 02:30:41.400
All right.

02:30:41.400 --> 02:30:41.460
All right.

02:30:41.460 --> 02:30:41.500
All right.

02:30:41.500 --> 02:30:41.640
All right.

02:30:41.640 --> 02:30:41.700
All right.

02:30:41.700 --> 02:30:41.740
All right.

02:30:41.740 --> 02:30:41.760
All right.

02:30:41.760 --> 02:30:41.860
All right.

02:30:41.860 --> 02:30:41.880
All right.

02:30:41.880 --> 02:30:41.900
All right.

02:30:42.040 --> 02:30:42.280
All right.

02:30:42.280 --> 02:30:42.320
All right.

02:30:42.320 --> 02:30:42.340
All right.

02:30:42.340 --> 02:30:42.380
All right.

02:30:42.380 --> 02:30:42.540
All right.

02:30:46.120 --> 02:30:48.100
And he sees you.

02:30:48.880 --> 02:30:49.920
Is that like a two-day walk?

02:30:51.500 --> 02:30:52.200
It is.

02:30:52.520 --> 02:30:52.960
Yeah.

02:30:52.960 --> 02:30:53.260
Okay.

02:30:53.660 --> 02:30:54.920
I thought it was.

02:30:54.920 --> 02:31:02.320
It's not a full week or anything, but if memories, I'm pretty sure it was a couple of days to

02:31:02.320 --> 02:31:03.200
get to and from.

02:31:04.120 --> 02:31:04.320
Yeah.

02:31:04.420 --> 02:31:04.880
That's what I thought.

02:31:06.520 --> 02:31:08.420
So, but yeah.

02:31:08.560 --> 02:31:12.020
So, you guys made it back to him, and he's, you know, he's got a lot of stuff going on.

02:31:12.040 --> 02:31:24.960
He's, you know, ecstatic to have, to see you again, and he says, I knew, I knew you would

02:31:24.960 --> 02:31:31.720
save the rest of them, but you're not going to like what's coming, but why are there so

02:31:31.720 --> 02:31:32.080
few?

02:31:36.080 --> 02:31:40.300
When I left, there were easily double that, double the amount.

02:31:42.040 --> 02:31:50.280
Um, and with that, the, uh, the one dwarf that you guys rescued kind of stepped forward

02:31:50.280 --> 02:31:55.740
and said, they, they took us and did things.

02:31:56.280 --> 02:32:05.040
Um, our friends left us and came back empowered with an, empowered with an element and brawls

02:32:05.040 --> 02:32:05.800
to the ogres.

02:32:05.800 --> 02:32:11.800
I don't know what sort of magic they've used, but it's nothing that...

02:32:12.040 --> 02:32:14.900
That we've seen ogres use prior to this.

02:32:15.640 --> 02:32:17.180
Something completely new.

02:32:20.180 --> 02:32:30.200
Um, for those of you that have giant something, like, I'm, I'm pretty sure there's a, uh,

02:32:30.560 --> 02:32:31.640
I think that's you, Jason.

02:32:31.840 --> 02:32:35.620
Like, you've got, like, giant knowledge or whatever.

02:32:36.120 --> 02:32:40.820
Um, the giant magic is very different than any magic that you're familiar with.

02:32:40.820 --> 02:32:41.820
What they use is what's...

02:32:42.040 --> 02:32:49.100
It's called rune magic, which is based off of, um, which are based off of magic runes,

02:32:49.100 --> 02:32:56.060
but they, but they are empowered by elements in the elemental planes, which is, it's very

02:32:56.060 --> 02:33:02.100
different than dwarven magic, which is also a form of rune magic, but it's, um, but the

02:33:02.640 --> 02:33:09.100
dwarven magic isn't, isn't rune magic so much as it's like, um, magical spells, incantations

02:33:09.780 --> 02:33:10.720
and that kind of stuff.

02:33:11.480 --> 02:33:11.960
Um,

02:33:12.500 --> 02:33:14.740
It's still arcane in nature.

02:33:15.020 --> 02:33:20.440
Yeah, it's more arcane in nature, whereas rune magic is more elemental in nature.

02:33:20.800 --> 02:33:21.060
Right.

02:33:21.060 --> 02:33:26.060
Um, you, you as a, um, as a...

02:33:26.060 --> 02:33:26.500
Elementalist.

02:33:26.780 --> 02:33:27.340
Kineticist.

02:33:27.680 --> 02:33:28.200
Yeah.

02:33:28.340 --> 02:33:35.840
You kind of, like, bridge the gap between elemental and arcane, um, and you are more

02:33:35.840 --> 02:33:36.460
unique.

02:33:36.640 --> 02:33:41.260
You know, a lot of people don't have that sort of thing, although the dwarves do still

02:33:41.260 --> 02:33:41.960
have...

02:33:42.040 --> 02:33:44.940
Elemental affinity and that kind of thing, too.

02:33:45.280 --> 02:33:49.740
Um, so similar, but very different.

02:33:49.740 --> 02:33:58.300
Um, in this world, the dwarves, the, the dwarven race is actually the master of arcane, kind

02:33:58.300 --> 02:34:00.740
of like the elves in a lot of other worlds.

02:34:00.900 --> 02:34:09.200
The elves are more, um, the elves are more, um, like, um, psions and psionics.

02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:11.740
They use, they use more psionics than, than...

02:34:12.040 --> 02:34:13.740
Anything, anything typically.

02:34:14.520 --> 02:34:14.980
So...

02:34:14.980 --> 02:34:15.100
Yeah.

02:34:15.100 --> 02:34:20.820
The scholars of magic are actually the dwarves, um, in, in Aetheria.

02:34:22.260 --> 02:34:22.740
Interesting.

02:34:22.960 --> 02:34:23.640
Just side note.

02:34:24.140 --> 02:34:24.840
Just side note.

02:34:24.840 --> 02:34:25.300
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

02:34:25.760 --> 02:34:26.480
Um...

02:34:26.480 --> 02:34:27.140
Interesting.

02:34:27.480 --> 02:34:31.660
So, with that, uh, we'll go ahead and call it for tonight.

02:34:31.960 --> 02:34:33.780
Thank you for sticking with me.

02:34:33.860 --> 02:34:36.280
I know that we're a few minutes over, but...

02:34:36.280 --> 02:34:37.200
No worries.

02:34:37.220 --> 02:34:38.440
I appreciate it.

02:34:39.200 --> 02:34:39.320
And...

02:34:39.320 --> 02:34:39.940
It's only a couple minutes.

02:34:39.940 --> 02:34:40.940
We, you...

02:34:41.520 --> 02:34:41.800
Yeah.

02:34:41.800 --> 02:34:41.880
Yeah.

02:34:41.880 --> 02:34:41.900
Yeah.

02:34:41.900 --> 02:34:42.000
Yeah.

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:42.020
Yeah.

02:34:42.040 --> 02:34:44.320
Is Clark gonna be that dude that we just met up with?

02:34:46.620 --> 02:34:47.140
Maybe?

02:34:47.960 --> 02:34:48.460
Maybe.

02:34:48.880 --> 02:34:54.640
I, I, I have a, I have a, I have a sneaking suspicion that that's, that's what's gonna

02:34:54.640 --> 02:34:55.140
end up.

02:34:55.180 --> 02:35:03.100
I had a different plan for Clark's character, but, um, this guy seems a lot better of a

02:35:03.100 --> 02:35:09.480
fit than the one that I was working on, so this is probably going to be Clark, this guy

02:35:09.480 --> 02:35:10.500
that you just saved.

02:35:10.800 --> 02:35:11.240
So.

02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:12.320
Oh, okay.

02:35:12.640 --> 02:35:12.940
Okay.

02:35:12.940 --> 02:35:23.020
Um, so I am going to be awarding everybody 500 XP for having defeated the ogres and having,

02:35:23.380 --> 02:35:31.740
um, and having saved the, um, saved the dwarves and gotten back to Captain Kale.

02:35:32.620 --> 02:35:33.940
So, um...

02:35:36.520 --> 02:35:38.400
So, everybody gets 500 XP.
