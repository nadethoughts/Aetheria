Alright, so when last we met, you guys were happening across a ritual that was taking place by a cave giant.
And we were beating them up pretty well.
Yeah, so you happened to cross this ritual that was taking place with the cave giant and four trolls.
Upon waiting things out a little bit to kind of see what was happening, you discovered that the trolls themselves, while they didn't look all that tough to begin with,
the cave giant, as it was performing the ritual, had them step into one of four gates and came out of the trolls, came out of said gates, empowered by the elements.
You were able to kill one of them before they entered into the gate, but the remaining three were able to enter into the gate before you were able to dispatch them.
One came out.
And this was taking place in the Rings of Quorum, which is an ancient religious slash religious relic site.
Although the dwarven community doesn't really understand what their purpose was up until this point.
So it was just kind of like a Stonehenge sort of thing.
Ancient dwarves used this in some mysterious way.
And then this dude comes and desecrates it.
Well, he comes and he turns it on.
So, but yeah, so you had one.
One job.
One giant.
Well, you did have one job.
And you are in the process of doing it.
Um, so out of the, out of the three trolls that entered into the, into the portals and came back out, you have one forest troll that you were able to dispatch.
One frost troll that is coming in for a, uh, to bring in some pain.
And a cavern troll that is keeping its distance and lobbing rocks at you pretty effective.
Um, shotgun.
Um, and the cave giant has closed ranks, uh, or has closed in to do some melee combat now that it has accomplished its goal of, um, of getting the, uh, of empowering the trolls with the elements.
Um, this has brought you with a actual, with some actual solid evidence for you to be able to bring to the, uh, bring to the, uh, dwarven king, uh, king, king deep mantle.
Uh, if you are able to defeat this giant and bring proof that a giant actually exists, um, this may aid you in your, uh, in, in your quest to make sure that Aaron hold is, um, protected.
Uh, if you do remember, um, there is Eric, uh, Silvervane, who has, whose name has repeatedly come up throughout the adventure.
Um, where, um, where it, where his, um, seal and things, while not being damning evidence correlates to, at best, gross negligence, at worst, malicious harm.
Um, but you haven't found anything that is just solid proof that, like, he is a traitor.
Um, you've only found things that allude to maybe he might have some involvement.
Um, so, I think that's pretty much it, uh, for where we are.
Uh, any questions, concerns, and, or, um, clarifications that, uh, anybody wishes to throw out before we begin?
Um.
Hmm.
Who do we kill first?
The big one.
They're all big ones.
Right.
I was gonna say, they're all, they're all big ones.
Anyway.
Just joking.
I think I'm ready to roll right into combat.
Yeah, let's, let's kill some stuff.
All right.
If that's.
Or get killed.
Well, it, it, this, it, it may happen one way or the other.
Um.
Yes!
Clark will be so excited.
If, if everybody died.
TPK.
All right!
I'm in!
This is what you get for not, uh.
Not helping us.
Not having me along.
All right.
Oh.
I need to.
We are at.
We are at the top of the round.
And the top of the round has the frost hole.
It has the frost hole beginning.
Um.
He is.
That's not fair.
Well, you know.
Life's not fair.
Well said.
Um.
He's barely hurt.
Yes, he is barely hurt.
Um.
He's going to.
Move in.
Take.
Take some.
Um.
Um.
Take some things for.
Demlor.
Okay.
So he's going to run in and.
Try to claw you.
Hmm.
That's not kind.
So he's going to swing once.
No.
I should probably target Demlor first.
Oh.
I can redo this game.
I feel like it's been a minute.
But it's only been two weeks.
All right.
Let's go.
Wow.
Nice.
Yay.
Somehow that doesn't hurt my feelings.
He's going to get you with his next one, though.
Oh, my gosh.
What am I rolling?
He's rolling like me.
Oh, my gosh.
You're terrible.
All right.
That's two.
That's one.
Maybe I'll roll a decent this time.
Um.
Okay.
He's.
He's.
He's.
He's going to.
He's going to bite you.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Three turns.
There you go.
He hit me.
He moved and tried twice.
Didn't he?
Oh.
Yeah.
You are absolutely right.
Forgotten how to play this game.
So that was three actions.
Yes.
So he ran in.
He clawed, clawed.
And he.
Yes.
All times.
Um.
Laura, you were saved by.
Uh.
By Scott's quick remembering here.
All right.
For me not giving.
For me not giving the frost troll.
Four actions.
All right.
Um.
It happens.
I'll try not to take four actions too.
All right.
So Hergan, you are up.
My turn.
Zoom in here to see this cave giant.
Swing at him.
Yeah.
He might as well.
I'm going to keep dancing with this frost troll.
It looks like.
You going to dance with him?
So.
Is that not?
All rolls are crappy.
Oh no.
Oh no.
You have a hero.
Yeah.
Do I?
You are a hero.
You do.
I have no idea.
Everybody has a hero.
Uh.
Everybody has a hero point.
Okay.
Let's re-roll.
This guy needs to die.
That'll hit.
Still weak.
Not critical though, right?
Right.
It's not critical.
You only hit by six.
So.
Seven and four.
Only one.
Well.
Okay.
So you lay.
You lay into him.
And just as.
What was it?
Your smoking axe?
This is your smoking axe.
Looks.
Yeah.
Just as it looks like it's about to lose.
Just about to go wide.
You out of fear.
Out of sheer will.
Move it.
Move it just a little bit further forward.
And are able to hack into the giant's thigh.
Healing 19 means of fire damage.
And.
That was action one.
Oh.
That was action one.
Get out.
Action two.
Okay.
All right.
And I have to hit the negative five thing on the multiple attack penalty.
Right?
Right.
Right.
Big money.
Big money.
Oh.
It's almost a 20.
Oh.
Oh my God.
Oh.
These dice got to warm up a little bit.
Huh?
All right.
Warm them up.
Blow them a little bit.
All right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe if we pull them off some more.
Oh brother.
Okay.
I guess I'll try a third time to hit him.
All right.
That's the negative 10.
So you're probably.
It's a long shot.
Real,
real good.
Real,
real well.
not that one.
Not that one.
Oh.
Hit him.
With your striking war hammer.
Hit him.
Good job.
All right.
All right.
And just,
and just so you know,
I'm not going to be actively hiding target numbers here.
It seems kind of silly,
but,
um,
you're,
you're 23.
Just hit him.
Like that was,
yeah,
he's tough.
So.
Another seven.
Those of you paying attention.
That's the,
uh,
that's the target number you're looking for.
Oh,
yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's 23 to hit.
So he couldn't hit me.
He is,
you,
so you just lay into him with a flurry of blows,
dealing six,
six blows.
Some of them knocking off of his armor.
Some of them hitting,
hitting and driving true.
Um,
he,
you,
uh,
push,
you know,
as you,
as under your onslaught and your fury,
uh,
he,
uh,
he kind of takes a few steps back,
you know,
kind of shakes,
shakes it off and then starts moving forward again.
But he is looking like he might be at,
um,
at death's door as,
as the saying goes.
Okay.
Okay.

So Demlor,
you are up now.
What are you going to do?
Kill them both.
Um,
um,
oh,
there it is.
Sorry.
Trying to,
I was trying to find my boulder roll,
um,
or something.
Um,
no,
that's not gonna,
um,
um,
um,
um,
so you have the cave giant that is at death's door you've got the frost troll that's barely
hurt and off in the distance you have a perfectly fine cavern troll
um i don't i so i was just trying to look at this tumbling teamwork thing i don't think it's going
to do what i what i'm thinking right here um i want to just um i guess kind of position myself
so that i am here maybe or over here so that i can do kind of a cone shot and hit both of these yahoos
is the goal
so okay is that is that making sense i think so
do i need to do so i could do a tumble tumbling you know teamwork tumble thingy whatever that is
um or do i just move there or does doing those things provoke uh you know in the dnd world attack
of opportunity but not what we call it here a reaction is that what we call it here
uh so i'm sorry i i was distracted for a hot second um so you're going to do a a cone attack
yeah uh using one of your abilities that does the cone
thing yeah shard strike
okay you know at least that ah sound of course it does that that's makes perfect sense that goes
um okay so what what was the question
uh um does it do i need to do
if i if i just move myself to like this position where i can make a cone
um so i'll put myself here right yep um i make a cone hit both of these turds does that do like a reaction
uh yeah so exiting a um exiting a um a threatened square will produce a reaction okay okay
um
i'm pretty sure
looking at this boulder roll that's another thing i'm wondering if this is
i don't understand what the dc 20 fortitude attempt is on that if i were to try that
it says it's against my athletics
or yeah my athletics
i don't i don't understand why it would be against my athletics and be a fortitude save
uh you're talking about push foes around so it's a fortitude save
against the giant or against whoever you're pushing
so i would have to roll a 20
uh
no the foe attempts the fortitude save
yeah so
take a step into the square of the foe that's your size or smaller
which these guys don't qualify
okay because they're bigger than me so
they're bigger than you yeah
say um okay this is your size okay
oh must enter
yeah
so that one's not gonna work okay good
um
yep
sorry
um if i do the tumble through does that
what what is it you're trying to do jason just get away from them
nope i'm trying to position myself here
like right over here where
yeah i would be in a cone where i could hit
instead or if i put myself here i could do a line and hit both of them
sure sure sure
so just move
um if they
so not everything in this game has an attack of opportunity
um if they do
i don't think there's any way to avoid it
uh
i could be wrong
uh the tumble through
is
so tumble through is like if you wanted to move
through one of them
uh-huh
right like if you wanted to move over here for example
through this one you would tumble through
so
unless you've got some
here
not
yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly but you can just you know
walk
then get down here
now if they have an attack of opportunity they will hit you with it
but not everything in this game does have one
and we don't
i think no these guys do or not
and as far as i know there's no way to avoid that
unless you've got some
feet or something
yeah i was wondering if that tumbling feet that i have would
would do that i don't see that it does
okay
um sorry
no worries
oh yeah um and it has
yeah we we have yet to have seen
whether or not these
whether or not these creatures do have an
have attack of opportunities or
what are called reactive strikes
in in this
so they very well may but they also
might not
let's provoke that attack of opportunity then
and we'll um
i think if
i think i put myself here and
and there's no
if i go two spaces do i provoke two opportunities
just one
no
every
even
even
even if you did
anything in this game
only has one reaction
so
oh okay
okay
all right
so i'll put myself there
yep
okay
that being said
i will qualify my
previous statement with one thing
if you only need to move one square
you can step
which does not
trigger reactive strikes
right
so if one square is all you need
then you're good
yeah if you move two squares though
yeah you
will provoke
good point ramsi
i
yeah i think um
i'll just go with the two
the two squares
i think that's the way to do it
okay
uh you do actually
provoke
an attack of opportunity
the frost troll
does indeed
have
a reactive strike
he's gonna use it
so he's going to
attempt to
claw you
and he will hit
with a crit
of a 40
well i ain't good
healing 26 points of damage
yep
that's not good
no that would be bad
so you
so you move away
and it basically
just rakes your back
um
as you
as you try and move away
you
you
move away as guarded as you can
but you know
you leave an opening
and he
bounces on it
um
your back
stings with uh
with
the cut
the cut of like
you know
um
not only is it
like a cut
it feels like dry ice
has raked across your back
all right
now do your thing
um
right
so
i am doing
the
shard strike
in the cone
i just
butcher in the whole thing
so anyway
um
where is that
leave me alone
yeah
okay
yeah
there
oh that ain't it
all right so if you do the
shard strike
that's going to be a reflex save
for them
uh-huh
uh-huh
you don't need to do an attack
um
okay
i will need to
that's just a 21
dc
reflex
all right
right
so
i'm gonna go ahead
um
did you bring that up there
yeah you did
okay
so we'll go ahead and have the cave full make a
he fails
and then
wow
barely
froth full
he got closed
fail as well
um
so
yep
so
basically
what you're going to be looking at here
is
uh
since you did the shards
for the
shard strike
um
if you
open up your
shard strike thing
it's got
um
a 3d6
slashing
that's in
yes
that's kind of like in a
in a box
if you click on that
it'll roll
damage
there's nothing added to it
ah
good job rolling
bunch of
ones
whoo
yeah
good job
buddy
um
and then we will damage the cave troll
who takes
seven
and
the frost troll takes
seven
yay
um
that was not a good exchange
no
no
i finally
rolled even
26 for 14
average damage
that would have been
would have been all right
all right
no
i just kind of suicided myself there
yeah
um
well i mean
you
you were trying to
damage
you're trying to get
a few things at the same time
which is not a bad idea
um
but yeah
i mean
they're
like
the cave
the cave giant
you could have just dropped
if you had focus fire
so
or you could have run in
that exact same situation
that you did
right here
right
i mean
dice beat dice
right
so
um
had you rolled well
you
with your damage
you probably
you probably could have gotten both
um
or at least dropped the cave giant
so it's not
like
it wasn't a bad
it wasn't a bad call
is what i'm trying to say jason
like
it wasn't a bad call
the dice
did he need to move
10
10
uh
i
i don't know
i've not done the cone
so i don't know
well
you do a measurement
of the
i think so
i can't tell how far
they are apart
um
well
if you look at the
ability to do that
if you look at the
shard strike
there
where it says that
15 foot cone
if you click on the box
that will reveal
a cone
then you can
press shift
and
or
press control
and then
use your scroll wheel
um
to like
organize the cone
um
and
as it turns out
if i'd have known that
i probably could have
just done it right from where i was
you could have just
yeah
like
where you
currently
where you were
um
yeah you could have just stayed where you were
i could have
i could have
yeah
look at what knowing something
means
j
and jason like
i mean honestly
considering
like that you
that you didn't quite
you know
know what that
how to
how to
organize that
and everything
like
i would be perfectly fine
with you
either
deciding that you wanted to do a five foot step
instead
or stay where you are
and just remove the reactive strike
like i've got no problem doing that
because i mean
it wasn't like
you made a strategic decision
i
at this point
i don't want to go back and redo this stuff
so like
i want to
well you don't
you don't have to
the only thing that i would do
is i would move you back up to where you are
and i would have
and i will remove the damage that you took
and that's it
oh okay
i see what you're saying
okay
yeah i've got to like
go back through and re-roll a bunch of crap and stuff
that's
that's fine
no
you do not have to
you do not have to go back and re-roll stuff
all right
so
and on top of that
yeah
and on top of that
you
if you
if you decide that you didn't move
you have an additional
you have an additional action that you could
use
maybe
you know
do a one
a one action
um
um
um
elemental blast
against the cave giant
and see if you can drop him
not to tell you how to do
like
no
hands off
hands off the wheel
but
like
yeah
i i just don't think it's fair for me to be like
well that's what you said you were doing
when you didn't
know that you were in a good position
at the beginning
so
or how to figure that out
um
all right
um
if i choose the elemental blast
uh
do i
which one of these do i do
the plus 12
the minus 5
the minus 10
uh
it would be the plus 12
uh
you would have to change your elemental blast
from the two action one
to the one action one
oh good
yeah
good
but you have not
um
but you haven't done
a single attack yet
you
you did something that required a
uh
that required a
save
but you haven't done a single attack
so you're
at
your full attack bonus
okay
oh also
um
while i'm thinking of it
this one
there's the
mountain strategy
or whatever that is
that
gives um
a plus one
i think it's to
i think
i think it's to damage
um
am i right on that
or is it to
it's a plus one
it's a plus one
to damage
or it's
it's a damage bonus
but it's not a damage bonus
to all of your abilities
right
right
it's supposed to be a damage bonus
to strikes
but you don't do strikes
so i made a house rule about it
working with your elemental blast
right
so
all right
because i
yeah i remember doing it with the elemental blast
yeah
so it'll boost your elemental blast
but it won't boost any of your templates
right
the other ones
that would be
too powerful
that'd be excessive
um
okay
so
with the elemental blast
then that one would
step in and take an effect
um
all right
so i think i'm
i think i've got my guy
i don't like that
it's in the way
yep
i did target him
all right
so i
roll for the
attack
i do a reasonable attack
i mean that's an average one
you miss by one
but i miss
by one
you could use your
i'm debating
or you could just let it lie
because i mean he is pretty biffed
but he is the next person who goes
too
right
it would be nice if he was gone
right
so i'm going
to re-roll
with the heroes
all right
that looks like a hit
and then
if i click on the damage thing
does that
is that'll do the damage automatically
right
yeah
and
if you had criticals
like if you see the little
arrow with the target on it
it automatically determines
whether you
damn it
oh okay
which one
are you critical
so whichever one has that little target
with the arrow on it
if you click that
that's the right one
to click
gotcha
okay
ah
not even as good as average damage
to this priest
all right
that's
okay
seven
yeah
that's seven
that's still seven points of damage
that you do
plus the
the one more
from the strategy
well
it was
mountain strategy
you plus two
at this point
which
which was
figured in there
which you did
kill him
so
oh my goodness
oh
yay
sorry
sorry
sorry
i feel like i over
i over
engineered
this
but like
you know
i had
i have every confidence
that jason
this is what you would have done
had you know
had you had all the information
so
yeah
now that
now that i
kind of have an idea
of how that
own thing works
that
i'm pretty sure
he would have killed me too
that was
that would have been
critical
you
you
i know you're barely hurt man
he couldn't
he could kill you
he hit ramsey once
with like
three times
damage
right
yeah
all right
so
um
how
so jason
how do you want to have killed him
this giant like
form of uh
like um
a stalactite
okay
forms above him
and just falls on his head
okay
um
all right
so uh
yeah
so he has this giant spike
sticking out of his head
um
very good
very good
bonks him on the head
and he's
oh
oh
all right
that's funny
and
that makes it
rurik's turn
all
righty then
uh
rurik
um
i believe this whole time
i've been fighting
action economy
so i don't
think i have a loaded
weapon at this point
um
so
we're going to
remedy that
um
we're going to
hide
and reload
and we are going to
load
a
fire bullet
uh
we're gonna
try to target this troll
there we go
um
and he is
off guard
we're going to
shoest him
where is
my fire bullet
uh
give me one second
to get him off guard
all right
he's good
no compatible
ammo in inventory
huh
uh
no more bullets
i know i have bullets
where did they go
yeah there's a whole
ton of them
hiding in a different
spot
that's weird
let me
try to
okay
normal
okay
uh
hmm
hmm
hmm
hmm
hmm
yep
mental
ammunition
compatible
ammo
what the
heck
these
uh
well
no ammunition
is assigned
check the actions
tab
yep
yep
yep
would
love
to
no
compatible
ammo
in inventory
uh
doesn't make any
sense
i know
i see it
in inventory
what happens
if i just go
up on there
no compatible
ammo in inventory
neat
neat
okay um
i'm going to
oh
interesting
there are a bunch
different types
of
ammo
mm-hmm
so
thunder
crasher
let's see
dwarven
scattergun
is the
rounds
that
rounds
dwarven
scattergun
that uses
thunder
crasher
uses
rounds
blunderbuss
um
what if i
switch it
to rounds
dwarven
scattergun
okay
yeah
so now
you're
thunder
crasher
you can
that's
only for
all right
cool
well i got
some kind
of ammo
so we're
gonna shoot
it
uh
well what
what type
of ammo
were you
going for
the the
fire rounds
elemental
ammunition
fire rounds
let me see
if i can
get that
in there
for you
so
true
you
specific
no
do
just
rounds
don't
work
check
and
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.

.
.
.
.
.
.
.
.
Thank you.
And which, is it the lesser fire ones?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Let me see if I can...
This thing here...
I...
I...
I...
I think...
Aha!
I...
I think I've got it.
Yes, yes.
I've got all the bullets.
So what I had to do is I had to go back into all of your ammunition and mark them all as...
Like, add them as rounds.
For some reason, they were...
They weren't counting as rounds.
So now you should be...
That's very weird.
Okay.
But I fixed it.
We're good.
We got it.
All right.
Cool.
Strike a strike.
Bam, bam, bam.
All that stuff is probably correct.
You better hit after all that.
Oh, we didn't just hit.
All right.
And then...
I remember it did not...
Let's see here.
Ammo, ammo, mount strategy.
Correct.
It did not add in the bane rune on it.
I'm just going to be another d6.

There we go.
Cool.
Bam, bam.
Okay.
And he needs to make a fort save.
She likely does.
Oh, yeah.
He does pass that.
Yeah.
Trolls probably have pretty good fort saves,
I would imagine.
But...
Oh, damn.
That's a lot of damage.
Yeah.
Especially for a frost troll.
Hitting him with a fire round.

Yeah.
Seems good to me.
All right.
Cool.
And then action three,
we're finally going to get ahead of the action economy
and we're going to hide and reload again.
So I will actually have a bullet
in the chamber
and maybe be hidden.
All right.
All right.
That's me.
Okay.
Next is the cavern troll.
And let's see your hide and reload.
Okay.
So the cavern troll
is going to
decide that he is going to
bring a rock at the guy
that's standing a little bit on top of the
of the rings
and is the closest
person.
So he is going to target hurry.
Again.
Not hurry.
Lava rock.
Use the giant for cover.
Right.
Oh,
that'll make scary noise.
And he hits.
He's very accurate
with boulders tossing.
He is very good
at boulder tossing.
It's kind of one of his special skills
and hits you
with 17 points
of damage.
And he's going to
just keep on
lovin' rocks.
Excellent.
This is the second time
and
the third.
Yay.
It's the third time.
So he's basically just kind of
machine gunning rocks
and he's basically like
as he starts
lobbing them
like at you guys
you are
realizing
that like
his
skin
is actually
what he's throwing.
Like the
the
rocks basically
just kind of
form around his skin
and he just
picks it off
like it's a
it's a fruit
flings it.
But he seems to be
regenerating
as trolls do
so it doesn't seem to be
affecting him at all
but he's just like
going
going to town
going to town.
Now it's the
frost
roll
roll
and
because you did
hit him
Meyer
I'm pretty sure
that means
that his
regeneration
is inactive.
He did not
regenerate
love to see it
but he does have
a very tasty
dwarf like right in
front of him.
He does.
I'm still here.
Look at me.
He's going to
claw you.
Oh.
Oh.
That's a mess.
Apparently he can
only hit you on
reactive strikes.
Um.
He's going to
make a claw.
Make another claw.
Oh.
He'll do it that
time.
Yeah.
He did it.
Dealing
12 points of
damage to you.
Wow.
Dude that wasn't
nice.
Yeah.
And he's going
to go for a
third one.
It would.
But miss
miss terribly.
Oh.
Okay.
Dang.
Then he's going
to die to
persistent damage.
And
he is going
to be at
death's door.
Almost.
Almost.
Almost.
Yeah.
Man can
dream.
Next time.
Next time.
All right.
Hurricane.
You're up.
There's no way
I can get to
that troll
up top.
Well with
that attitude.
That's right.
With my
short legs.
I cannot
get to him.
How far
away is he?
65 feet.
65 feet.
All right.
What is our
move?
Is our move
20?
20?
As a dwarf
it's 20.
So you
would have
to triple
move and
you still
would be
5 feet
out from
it.
Right.
Wow.
Do you
have any
ranged
abilities?
No.
Well
Scott.
I guess I
got to kill
this
skew.
well you
you can
but I
mean
you're
going to
run out of
stuff to do
real quick
all the way
down there
but I guess
you could
move down
and attack
him and
start moving
towards the
other guy
or whatever
or you guys
can choose
to just
run as
this guy
lobs rocks
at you
well
yeah
my other
two
compadres
have ranged
things and
they're going
to shoot
him first
so yeah
I might as
well
well you
don't know
how many
hit points
this guy
has
and
he's
made
out of
earth
which has
a tendency
to be
really
really
really
tough
so
that being
said I
would not
expect him
to be
dead
at the
end of
next round
and
then you'll
have to
triple move
and still
not get
to him
if you
don't start
moving that
direction
this time
so
just
just some
friendly
don't want
you to have
a wasted
turn
so
but I do
like handing
people
yeah
no I'm
not saying
don't
kill the
frost roll
by all
means kill
a frost roll
just don't
expect the
guy that
the guy
that's 65
feet away
from you
to be
dead next
time
I don't
care what
Ramsey rolls
Ramsey can
kill him
I have
confidence
I do not
have that
confidence
Ramsey was
able to do
what he did
to the frost roll
because he
used fire
ammunition
against a
cold creature
so
that's
that's what
causes that
that's what
caused that
to happen
so
will the
frost roll
just die
without me
hitting him
Ramsey
uh
maybe
probably
but he'll
get another
turn
because it
happens at the
end of his
turn
it's still a
good idea
to step in
and kill him
one of us
should do a
final blow
I'm right
here
I will
attack
I can go
and go
there
and attack
and then
maybe I can
move 20
feet closer
after I
kill him
hopefully
exactly
that's what I
was hoping
for and again
I'm sorry
if I'm being
too pushy
on this
stuff
but like
I think
that's a
good
I just
want to
make sure
that you
that you're
aware
of the
situation
did you
award any
hero points
not yet
not timed
yet
oh my gosh
what is
going wrong
karma is
coming back
around
Scott
you always
roll like
20s
no I
don't
not for
the last
not in
this game
actually
I gotta
try again
I guess
so
well
let me
see here
um
Scott
so
again
you know
strategy
wise
um
you are
not
currently
in a
flanking
position
you could
have put
yourself in
a flanking
position
which
um
would have
given you
a plus
two to
hit
which would
have made
one uh
which would
have made
your smoking
axe attack
actually have
hit
so
if you
want to
move
down
one
that puts
you in a
flanking
position
which would
have made
your
um
which would
have made
your smoking
axe
hit
sure
i guess
i thought
i was
flanking
no
you have
to be
directly
opposite
so like
just kind
of like
think of
the guy
as a
square
and as
long as
you're on
the opposite
side of
the square
from your
opponent
you're
flanking
um
okay
or die
that's what
i was trying
to do
i thought
i was
there
sorry
no
no
no
problem
um
and i
would have
i wouldn't
have brought
it up
if you
hadn't
have missed
with this
smoking axe
by what
oh
um
like it
wouldn't
have made
a difference
if you
rolled lower
uh so go
ahead and
roll damage
on your
smoking axe
i can do
that even
though it
says miss
yeah just
click on the
damage button
okay
i'll take
all the
freebies
oh my
gosh
we kill
the frost
because that
one has
fire on
it so
oh
could be
dead
and then i
can move
just move
up 20
he's sleeping
that's so
cute
40
10
10
15
20
i think
there
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
okay
alright
okay
okay
so
I am trying to make sure that everything is properly rated.
All right, so Hergan runs in, sweeps in.
How do you want to have killed the Frost's troll?
I think I'll get my fiery axe stuck in his belly
and then just yank it out with my foot against his belly
and pull it out and he just oozes over and dies.
Right.
Because he's so much taller than us.
It's true.
The burn radiates out from the wound
and he falls over with a roaring death cry.
And Demlor, you are now on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop it.
Stop.
Oh, you're so temperamental.
I think I can move.
I can, what?
75, yeah.
Yeah, just a little, little far.
Um, I definitely got to, you know, close, close ground here a little bit.
Um, I don't know.
Yeah, I'm.
Shard strike is a two action.
Doesn't matter what I do.
Um.
I can do a.
All right.
We do have a, we do have a hero point that is incoming, um, this time around.
We are going to grant it to Demlor.
The eight person is slashing.
Um.
So it looks like on my elemental blast.
I can do 30 feet.
Right.
Um.
I think, yeah, I think that's about what I've got.
Um.
Yeah, you, you're, you're a medium range combatant, so you don't really have a lot of, like, long
range stuff.
I've got a long range.
Yeah, I've got one long range attack, but it's three actions, and I'm too far out for
that.
So I have to take a movement one way or the other.
I come in the 20 feet there.
That's one move.
It doesn't matter what I do.
I gotta go.
Well, something that you should remember, you do have these, this lovely magical item
called the, called the boots of free running.
Um, once per day, the traction on your boots improves, allowing you to run along a vertical
surface for a minute.
When you stride, uh, start moving on a horizontal surface, you can stride off, blah, blah, blah,
blah.
It doesn't increase your movement speed.
It just allows you to run on walls.
Yeah.
That was my understanding.
Fuck.
I was hoping.
Uh, I know, right?
Yeah.
Um.
So I think, yeah, I think the move is, uh, there's 20, 20 foot's one move, 40 foot's another
move.
Um, I'll put myself there.
I'm 30 feet.
I would also point out that you do have your eight attenuator, which allows you to once
per day, um, cast Thunderstrike, which is 120 foot range.
What is this?
Uh, it's a spell.
Yeah.
Uh, put in the, uh, put in the, uh, eight attenuator in the chat.
First, though.
I mean, it doesn't do like a ton, a ton of damage, but it would allow you to at least
like move towards the guy and do something rather than just move, move, move.
Right.
Yeah.
I think that's it.
Yeah.
I'll have to look at that a little bit more, but, um, I'm within range of doing, um, Elemental
Blast.
It'll be a one, it'll be just the one action.
Okay.
Um, but I'm, I'm here.
So I think I'll go ahead and give that a go.
So, yeah.
Uh, yeah.
Okay.
Sorry.
Thank you.
Okay.
He is.
Hmm.
Do that.
We do this.
Oh, that's a decent roll.
And that is a hit.
And you did use electricity.
All right.
Yes.
Go ahead and roll damage on that.
Come on.
Oh.
Ooh.
Like better than average damage.
Nice.
Very nice.
Not bad at all.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Nice.
And you do get the plus two because you, from the mountain strategy.
So.
Oh, okay.
Um, otherwise you wouldn't have anything added to that roll.
Cause it's just a one action one.
Okay.
I'm dealing 14 points of electricity damage.
Hmm.
All right.
Uh.
Very exciting.
Yeah.
No, that was good.
All right.
Rurik, you're up.
All right.
Uh.
It's 80 away.
It's up next.
Uh.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Well, I think.
You got a magma bullet?
My.
Yeah, I wish.
I think the best thing to do here.
So I already have a bullet in.
Um.
We're going to get a range penalty, but I think we're just going to shoot from here.
Well, is that worth it?
With the, with the map?
Hmm.
Maybe not.
Maybe not.
Uh.
Uh.
We're going to, we're going to move.
All right.
25.
We're going to move up for one.
And then we're going to shoot him.
Uh.
It's still a range penalty.
Barely.
But.
That's all right.
We're a little closer for next time.
If there is, it's a next time.
Uh.
Uh.
And we shoot.
Uh.
No ammunition was assigned.
Uh.
Excuse me?
Yes.
That one.
Use that ammunition.
Still want to do fire, because it is still troll.
All right.
Cool.
Bam.
Uh.
Good enough.
We will take it.
Uh.
We still have.
the.
Bane rune.
Uh.
So let's add this damage.
And then roll.
Hi.
No.
Put it in there.
Bam.
Bam.
All right.
Sick.
Uh.
And then.
We will, for our third action, hide and reload again.
And that is me.
All right.
Very close.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
So the cavern troll is up.
He is going to.
Let's see.
That's right there.
Uh-oh.
30 feet out.
45 feet out.
Look at that.
We did some damage.
Oh, yeah.
He pretty much healed it all, though.
No, he didn't.
Um.
And.
Yeah.
Uh.
That was.
He.
He did not heal it.
Um.
Thank you for calling that out, though.
It just automatically.
Heals.
Even if they took electricity.
Or fire damage.
His fault.
Um.
Now he's going to move.
Let's see.
Down here.
Get in your room.
Get in your bed.
And he's going to.
Forget them more.
Oh, yeah.
He should.
Um.
And he's going to claw him.
Claw.
Uh-huh.
But did he come up to me?
Yeah.
Oh.
You roll over to a 15.
You little turd.
All right.
12 points of damage.
And then he's going to take another claw at you.
I'm not feeling good.
Oh.
He hit again.
Yeah.
Oh.
This time he's going to hurt a lot more.
19 points of damage.
Oof.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's not good for you.
I'm pretty well dead here.
Well.
You.
You are definitely.
At death's door.
I am.
Yeah.
Uh.
He.
And he doesn't have a fourth action.
Which is very sad.
Because.
He had a thing that he would do.
If he had a fourth action.
That just doesn't happen here.
So.
Um.
That's going to be.
That's going to be him.
Excellent.
Hmm.
He does.
One point of persistent fire damage.
But he does.
Actually recover from it.
So he's.
No longer.
He no longer has.
Persistent.
Irrigan.
You're up.
Mess him up.
Mm-hmm.
So is he.
Is he.
He's not close enough to Jason.
Where I can flank him.
Well.
That's correct.
He has a reach of 10 feet.
So.
He.
Doesn't need to be.
Like right next to Jason.
Can I go there?
Uh.
Yeah.
20 feet.
For sure.
So that's one action.
Mm-hmm.
Maybe I can hit him twice.
Maybe.
I'm going to switch my first attack.
And my second attack up.
Because the rolls have been sucky.
That's not good.
Mm-hmm.
And not great.
Um.
Both of those do miss.
Yeah.
Big money.
Big money.
Mm-hmm.
That's some big money.
Oh.
That's a good one.
Excellent.
Excellent.
Do the small one first.
12 points of damage.
With the Warhammer.
Nice.
Oh.
And 40 points of damage.
Holy cow.
With the smoking axe.
What happens when you mess with Demalur?
All right.
All right.
That's right.
That's right.
That's so far, friend.
Yeah.
So you just lay into him.
You, you, the, your first couple of attacks basically kind of bounce just off of his skin
as it's made out of rock.
But then you find a new resolve and lay in with good power behind each of your attacks, dealing
one and then two, one strike and then a second critical strike, hamstringing him, giving him,
causing, causing much damage and destruction.
And you are, if this was any of the other trolls that you've been fighting, you would have completely decimated this guy.
But he's made out of sterner stuff than that.
So he shakes it off.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's made out of caverns.
So, so he shakes it off and renews his, renews his, his desire for taking, taking you out.
Now, Demalur, you're up.
It looks like I have him targeted.
It certainly does.
And we'll try this.
Good luck.
Good luck, buddy.
Oh, 15.
That's not bad.
Get him.
Oh, that looks like a hit.
It doesn't give me a damage thing.
Oh, magnetic pinions is only good if you're, well, like, oh, my gosh.
I mean, I guess it's good this case, too, because you rolled almost max damage, but I had 31, three, eight.
That came out pretty average damage, I guess.
Pretty average.
But magnetic pinions is, magnetic pinions is really good when you've got three opponents outside of that.
Yeah, it's really good.
Okay.
But I think it's, it's my highest, like, volume of dice that I can throw for damage.
It might be your highest volume of dice, but I think that your elemental blast does more damage.
Um, yeah, maybe.
Yeah.
Oh.
It does.
This is a good one.
It's a fun one.
It's true.
And like I said, if you're going against multiple opponents, it's great.
Um, but now you're.
There we go.
Your connect war disappears.
Yeah.
And, yeah, but you do 15 points of damage to that thing, doing, just laying into him and, and all that stuff.
And I will stop.
Spikes of steel flying everywhere in its general direction.
You know, just going everywhere.
Exactly.
And, 
And I will stop telling you how to play your character.
You do you, man.
So.
Speaking of, uh, Rurik, you are.
Uh, let's, uh, put this thing down.
Ooh, he's at that store.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He ain't going to like me too much.
All right.
We got one in the chamber.
Uh, click, click, boom.
I.
Realizers.



All right.
Click, click, boom.
Uh.
Oh, dude.
I do suspect that's going to do it.
All right.
Oh, hold on.
Well, let's not forget the, uh, the Bane here.
All right.
Cool.
All right.
Added.
And boom.
Oh, those dice aren't great, but it'll be fine.
All right.
He's going to try and make his fortitude save first.
He does a successful one.
Holy cow.
36.
Good Lord.
He really succeeds that one.
Um.
Um.
And.
Yes, indeed.
That is enough.
Mm-hmm.
Excellent.
Uh, so how do you want to have killed him?
Uh, so I see, after watching this guy mess up my, my buddy Demelor, um, I just work kind
of like takes a shotgun and starts like, oh, I can't, I'm not in movement.
Starts like walking towards him and just, you know, just keeps cocking and blowing rounds
into him.
Um, just knocking pieces off of them.
Uh, crystals and stone go flying, um, until he's just not moving anymore.
And then I'll put a couple more into him just to make sure.
All right.
There we go.
Oh.
Yeah.
When, um, when this guy drops, I'm going to pull out.
My lovely little, I'm just, this party thing's in my way.
Get out of my way, party thing.
Um, there are more important things to do than look at parties.
Um.
Recording rod.
And I am going to start recording.
Which goes for one minute.
Um.
And I'm going to do a, a quick, uh, you know, like a one minute YouTube video, uh, capturing
each of the trolls and the giant, explaining what we saw, what happened, our fight, and all
that good jazz.
It's a great idea.
Right.
So, I used it.
Yeah.
And then I'm going to look around, like, yeah, I'm about, I should probably do something
about healing.
Yeah.
Yeah, we should.
We should see that before we, before we get moving.
If I, if I, if I die, take this, make sure it gets to the king.
Can't make this crap up.
Are you right?
Unless, of course, you're Chris, then apparently you can.
Uh.
Right.
Well.
You can try.
I won't.
I don't know why, but for some reason, Demlor is being treated like he's an NPC and not
a player.
That's weird.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um.
Maybe it's because I have no soul.
That'd be great.
Um, okay, so we are going to, everybody, um.
I have a lesser portion of healing.
Is that even worth using?
Um, probably not.
Since we're out of combat, I can just medicine you.
So, it'll take some time, but.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, the potions of healing are more useful in combat.
Um.
Yeah.
That's what I thought.
I don't know if this is, I don't know if this is, this is probably not Pathfinder.
This is guaranteed not Pathfinder 2e.
This is the house rule, but if you want to cough a potion for an action, I will, that,
that's perfectly fine.
I think PF2e makes you pull a potion out and then drink it as for two actions, which.
Yeah.
It's super painful.
When, yeah, when I, when I found out about that, when I was playing in Ramsey's game,
I was like, no, I'm never drinking a potion ever.
Yeah.
Why would you do that in combat?
Just die a little time, almost every time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, actually, what, uh, didn't I take, hang on, hang on.
It would be too bad that, that Cavernful didn't survive around and didn't have Lightning Bolt.
It would have been amazing.
Um, yeah, that's right.
I can treat two targets.
So I'm going to treat both Horgan and Demlor at the same time.
Ah, sweet.
Um, and hopefully do well.
We sure did.
Sick.
So both you guys.
Heal 21.
Whoa.
That's pretty good.
Look at that.
I'm now at 28.
And then 10 minutes later, because I have the, uh, uh, the thing, the feet.
I'm going to target myself and Demlor and go again.
This, um, was there, I thought I was reading something about, um, this is,
your feet's probably dealing with it.
Um, you can use medicine.
Right.
So many times in a certain amount of time, like you're immune to it again.
Correct.
Normally you're immune for an hour.
Um, but I have a feet that knocks that down to 10 minutes.
Whoa.
So, so every 10 minutes I can heal somebody, which is pretty great.
Yeah, that is.
Okay.
All right.
Oh, sick.
We made it again.
Yeah.
I will apply healing to me.
I am pretty good.
All right.
And then.
I'm, I'm, I'm about halfway there.
No, I'm a little over two, maybe two thirds.
Okay.

We're going to do one more time.
Looks like I'm a little worse off than Hergan at this point.
So not too bad.
So we'll take, this will be half an hour, but that's time probably well worth.
Hopefully.
Uh, this has been, so I think the longest we've had, uh, so far in the past,
like 72 in-game hours.
So who knows?
Right.
Uh, all right.
Ooh.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Not great.
Um, but.
I just re-roll that.
No, it's not worth 10 minutes to re-roll it.
We'll just go 40 minutes.
I don't want to take a whole ton of time, but.
You know.
Well, there's a lot here to, to look over.

All right.
Sick.
Well, that does it.
I'm full.
That should bring you to full.
Or close.

And Hergan, it looks like you're pretty close to full as well.
So, okay.
All right.
Sick.
So we took 40 minutes.
All right.
Um, and as you do, you start, um, I guess, Hergan, you're kind of, or whoever, um, who's not,
whoever's not getting, uh, treated at the time.
Um, I start, you guys are piecing through the, um, piecing through the, the cave giant and the, um, trolls and just kind of, like, you know, doing what you do, looting bodies and whatnot.
Um, and you are able to find a lieutenant's sash, a lion's pelt, a chain lion's pelt, a shadow, a spring heel, terrifying ammunition, a Fulu of concealment, a beckoning cat amulet, a rhino hide brooch, a potion of disguise lesser.
A tin cobra, a tin cobra, and 320 gold.
Whoa.
Hmm.
Sick.
Um.
Now.
Okay.
That sash I don't need.
That's better for somebody.
What was that?
Now.
That lieutenant's stash to the dude that keeps helping us.
Okay.
So the lieutenant's stash is actually really nice.
Uh, what it does is you get to spend a reaction to add a plus one to somebody's role.
So in those examples where somebody's, um, where somebody's missing by one, you can use your reaction once per hour to make that person, um, succeed when they would have failed.
Um, and that works with both, um, saving throws and, um, um, let's see here.
Giving them a plus one circumstance bonus to saving throws.
They attempt as a result of that reaction, um, and a plus one circumstance bonus to their AC attacks me during the air.
Okay.
So it's not, it doesn't affect, um, a hit, but it'll give you a bonus to saving throws and give you a plus one AC.
And so it does the opposite though.
Like if the bad guy hits you by one, then you can, if they just hit you, then somebody can, then the person with the lieutenant's stash can basically, um, use their reaction to give you an AC boost.
So you don't get hit at least that's how I read it and pretty sure that's what it is.
So it's a defensive one.
It's not an offensive one, but it's still really, really good.
And the lion's pelt chain is, um, a chain shirt.
So if you can't use, um,
I think most of you guys are light armor wares.
So light and medium, I can technically wear it, but it's,
I mean, it's the, I would be fine for me, but it's like,
it's not.
Yeah.
Oh,
that spring heel is probably pretty good for people who want to get in closer than I do.
I can make you go zoom a little bit.
Uh,
it's going to snag that terrifying ammunition.
I imagine I'm the only one interested in it.
The shadow rune is really good for any of us to boost stealth by one,
which is good for,
I think all of us cause we're all kind of stealthy like a little,
a little bit stealthy there.
Um,
I was going to say it probably would work really be really helpful for you.
Um,
I was going to suggest the spring heel for,
um,
hurry in there.
Right.
Yeah.
I can totally see that.
I just know I don't particularly need it.
Right.
Oops,
took it twice.
Oh man.
Parable person.
Hmm.
So the rhino hide just absorbs five on a specific hit.
Hmm.
That spring heel could be really cool for.
Bird in there.
That.
Okay.
Amulet, Chris, does that count? Hero points?
Because I'm not sure any of us...
Well, I don't want anybody else, but I don't have any
kind of lucky re-roll kind of thing.
I think I don't have...
Oh, nice.
There's a cat amulet that when you make a lucky re-roll,
it can also affect your companions, too.
Like, they can also re-roll.
So, any allies than 10 feet, which is pretty sick.
Okay.
So, that's just for the hero point, right?
Or not?
If you use a feat or ability to re-roll a failed...
Oh, okay, never mind.
Never mind.
Okay.
I don't think I have that, then.
Okay.
Never mind.
My bad.
I lie.
Nice.
Oh, right or hide.
Yeah, it does not affect the hero points, unfortunately.
Okay.
Cool.
Cool.
Yeah, I don't...
The lion's pelt thing.
I don't know.
I've got a little bit of an armor on already that I think I like.
Sure.
The lieutenant sash thing could be neat.
Yeah.
So, the lieutenant sash is...
Plus one circumstance bonus to saving throws as a result of a reaction.
But it has to be a reaction that's triggered from an enemy.
Okay.
So, an enemy does something that triggers...
Would give you a reaction.
And then this...
This would be helpful to you then.
Maybe because the attempt has a result of a...
Oh, wait a minute.
Enemy or hazard.
Oh.
Sure.
Yeah.
So, if I were wearing this, it would potentially...
Both benefit, you know, either of you guys.
By giving you a plus one.
Against a saving throw from an enemy trying to use a reaction.
So...
I could see myself wearing that and that being beneficial to...
Yeah.
Everybody.
I concur.
So, I'll take the lieutenant's stash.
Dropped it into my thing.
I'm going to put it on.
Oh, my God.
What kind of armor do you have again?
Do I wear it?
I was looking at that to see if the what I have is better.
It depends.
You have the text.
Oh.
Hmm.
So, I think what you have is a little better AC.
Um.
At least I think that's correct when we take your decks into account.
The lieutenant's stash doesn't add anything to your AC, right?
No.
It doesn't look like it does anything for that.
Okay.
Yeah.
It's a chain to light armor.
Okay.
It's a chain shirt.
I see.
Um.
Yeah.
I can, I guess, take the lion's belt.
Yeah.
Hergan, I think yours is one better AC for you, what you already have.
Um.
Yeah.
It seemed a little bit heavier.
All right.
So, take that.
Scott, did you take the spring heel?
I did.

Okay.
Good, good.
I don't understand the tin cobra, but it sounds cool.
But I don't know what it means when it activates when a creature enters.
It's better gun too, but that's still fine.
It sounds like a booby trap, essentially, if you get, you know, and it's, it's square,
then it sprays acid, for lack of a better term, poison.
Sounds fine.
Sounds fine.
Um.
I guess, I guess a guy could take it, so maybe I'll take it.
Hey, buddy.
You like to do cool stuff.
Those Fulus, I think, can go to anybody.
I'm just going to take them.
They're kind of like a group use item, if we want to be invisible at some point.
Yeah.
Um.
The shadow, like I said, is good for any of us.
Um.
I can take it.
I tend to stealth more than others, because I do it in combat.
Yeah.
I was thinking you would take that.
I also have a pretty good stealth, so.
Okay.
Alrighty.
What is your stealth?
Uh.
It is.
You got 12?
No.
60.
Skills.
Plus 15.
Oh, you are up there.
Holy cow.
Mm-hmm.
All right.
Okay.
I don't have that anymore.
Okay.
Did you take the rhino-hide brooch, Scott?
Nope.
Nope.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Hmm.
I mean, I'm going to need somebody with crafting to help, I think, with the shadow
rune on the armor.
But I think I'm also going to need Chris's help to explain how I do that in this thing.
Because it is not apparent to me.
Yeah.
It might be something I have to throw on there.
Okay.
Maybe I can do it from the armor?
Yeah.
It's basically in the armor.
If you can edit your armor, there's a detail section.

And in the detail section, there's a loon thing.
So, maybe you can add it through that, but if not, I can do it.
Gotcha.
Yeah, I think I got it there.
Am I right, Chris, in that this rhino-hide brooch has to be added to the armor?
Uh, the brooches themselves just need to be attached to the armor, and that's just, that's
like putting a pin on it.
Oh, okay.
So, it doesn't require any crafting check or anything.
It's just like, you hook it, you hook it onto your armor.
All right.
Okay.
Um.
Um.
So, if you need help crafting that, I think.
I have trained crafting.
I don't know.
Uh, Hergan.
Me too.

What is, what is your train crafting?
I think it was a nine when I looked at it.
Oh, okay.
Okay.
Nine.
Yeah.
I'm at an 11 on that.
So, if you need help, one of, either of us can probably do that reasonably.
Okay.
Um.
At least try.
Did you, did you want that, um, rhino hide brooch, uh, Hergan?
I think that could, is it one that's right?
Yeah, I was thinking I would take it.
Yeah.
I can take it.
Sounds good.
All right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
So, are you guys about, do you guys have the loot figured out at this point, or?
I believe so.
The only thing that I don't think we've, uh, tried to deal with is the gold there, right?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Um.
I don't know if there's an easy way to split that or not.
Or would we just each take, uh, 80?
Yeah, yeah, we can just add, each add 80.
Okay.
Boop.
Um, as you guys, um, so, um, after you defeat the cavern giant, the, the, um, the rings,
the quorum start flickering, and before you even finish your first, um, your, your first
healing, your first round of healing, working on everybody's wounds, uh, the, uh, light of
the runes just goes out.
Um, um, uh, barely got that recorded before they go out.
All right.
Pretty much.
Pretty much.
Um.
All right.
among the, uh, remnants of the ritual site, you do, you do also see in the center near
where the cavern giant was, um, a sealed iron coffer, which doesn't, like, for the giant
would have been, like, you know, kind of like a, a coin purse sort of thing.
But for you guys, it's pretty large, um, and it is sealed, um, with some sort of, um, some
sort of mechanism.
Hmm.
I'm assuming large means we're not moving it.
Uh, it's, you could move it.
Yeah.
But we're not going to, because it's going to be too heavy, too bulky.
It's, yeah, it's, it's really, yeah, it, it would be, it, it's kind of like a, um, I
mean, depending, you could just lug it around with you.
Um, it's, it's, uh, it's a four bulk item, um, so it's not impossible to carry.
It's just, it'd be really big and unwieldy.
Mm-hmm.
Yep, 
Uh.
And upon inspection, it, it, is this looking like it's locked by magic or locked by, uh,
by device?
It appears to be locked by, uh, device of some kind.
Nothing to it screams you, nothing about it screams magic to you.
Okay.
Um, would a crafting check, or would it be more, like, thievery?
Probably more thievery, right?
Uh, it, the answer to that question is yes.
Okay.
Perfect.
So, you could use either.
It just depends, like, it will, it will just affect the, um, it'll affect the overall,
um, DC.
So, tell me which, tell me which one you want to try, and I'll give you the DC for it.
Um, I'd be willing to try a thievery on it.
Okay.
So, for a thievery, uh, for a thievery, you're looking, you're looking at a DC-15.
Okay.
I will roll a thievery.
Yeah.
Oh, that's pretty good.
Oh, that's a really good one.
Oh, yeah.
Easy peasy.
Oh, yeah.
Um, so, the mechanism is, looks like it may have been complicated for some people, but
you are not some people.
Yes.
You know exactly how to handle this situation, and you've actually come across a few of these,
uh, a few mechanisms that are similar to this in the past.
Um, you are able to open it with little to no trouble.
Um, inside, uh, you look, are expecting to find more treasure or, or different, or, you
know, magic items or something, uh, but you are not able to find anything except for, um,
um, a note, um, and inside the note, uh, I've thrown the note in, in the, uh, chat, um, but
I'll just go ahead and read it.
Inside the note, you, you find a scroll, um, bearing Beric's, um, personal seal and written
in, and written orders in his hand.
Um, they lead, hammer gate hold, will hold the line, sentinels rise, will fall silent,
rings, the rings must awaken, empower the thralls, and the throne will be ours.
Not today.
Not very cryptic.
Nope.
Huh.
Huh.
Uh, hammer, hammer's hold will hold the line.
That's what it said.

Uh, I, I click on it and it tells me I don't have sufficient permission.
Uh, to view the sheets.
So.
Yeah.
Same.
Um.
If you wanted me to look at it.
Let me grant you the correct permissions.
All right.
Uh.
Uh.
Uh.
Discuration.
Friendship.
Observer.
All right.
I'm going to go.
Oh, there we go.
Oh, there we go.
Yeah.
Huh.
Well.
There we go.
Uh.
Yeah.
That worked out perfectly.
Thank you.
Um.
Mm-hmm.
Well.
I put the secret note in my treasure.
Mm-hmm.
So, if anybody ever needs to recover it from my dead body, you know it's there.
Indeed.
Um.
These.
Uh.
We had a way to communicate back to the throne, but we didn't want to use it because we weren't
sure if they were trustworthy.
Was that Varric's thing?
I feel like it wasn't.
I feel like it was the, the other person who still may be involved, I guess, but.
Yeah.
So, the person that gave you the way of communicating was Keldra Deepshiver.
I think.
He is the flymaster to the king.



But she did give you some, um, if memory serves, you guys thought that she had some definite
woo-woo vibes of like, uh, I don't know if I should trust this kind of thing.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Which, you know, anybody that you know is a spy ought to give you that kind of heebie-jeebies.
Um.
Um, but the only person who has been specifically called out to you is Varric, and he was called
out to you by Bramley Stoneguard, the captain of the guard.
Yeah.
Who basically is noting that Varric seems to be a little bit more ambitious, more ambitious
than he should.
Um, yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Um.
I'm just wondering if there is a way.
It's like a sending stone we have, right?
Is it like a one use once per day kind of thing?
Or how does, or how does, I'm just trying to remember.
Um, so it's a, um, it's a piece of parchment that you, it's basically a two-way parchment.
Um.
Uh-huh.
So it, it, uh, so the spy master has the, um, the sister piece.
So you write something in your piece of parchment, and it will appear in her piece of parchment.
And she can write back, and vice versa.
Okay.
Okay.
Excellent.
As long as you guys have parchment left, then you can communicate.
But if you...
It would write a whole novel.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right?
Okay.
So I'm wondering if there is a way we could...
Because I'm starting to think, you know, Varric's the confirmed bad guy.
She may actually be loyal, just like you were saying, giving off the vibes, because, you know,
spy master.
Right.
But I still don't fully know if I trust that.
So I'm wondering if there's a way we can, like, craft a message to, like, try to see
if she knows more than she should.
You know what I mean?
That's a hard one.
Yeah, yeah, it is.
But, like, you know, give some information, or maybe give some misinformation, you know,
to see if...
I don't know.
I'm not real sure, Ramsey, how that would work.
Like, my character is also not super smart, so he probably wouldn't know either.
Yeah, I catch what you're saying, and I'm thinking, yeah, we'd almost need to set it up
in such a way that if she's working with Harvick, or whatever his name is, if she's on his payroll,
then, you know, we would send something that would then cause him to act in a way that betrays
her allegiance.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Or send something to the king, you know, like a message that we would hope would get to the king
that would then cause her or Harvick to respond, you know, again, betraying their relationship.
Sure, sure.
Or confirming the relationship with the king.
So, that's kind of the...
Yeah, kind of the thinking there.
It's a great idea.
How are you going to do it?
I mean, I don't think Rurik has the skills to try.
Like, not just skills, but like...
He definitely came up with the idea, but I don't think he's willing to try to match wits
with a spymaster if she turns out to be...
But I mean, like, also, like, what have we just sent?
Like, not trying to trick her or outsmart her necessarily, but what have we just sent a
message that made it seem like everything was going according to plan for Varick's plan,
right?
Like, you know, write something desperate, you know, towns fall and there's ogres everywhere.
Like, we're trapped and hunkered down near...
I forget the name of the town.
The one that was just in the note whose name I heard, like, three seconds ago.
Essentials rise.
That one?
You know, hold.
Is that the one?
Yeah.
No, no, no.
Or sentinel's rise.
Sentinel's rise is the one, because that was the one that, the tower that...
Right.
...had been destroyed.
Right, right.
Just kind of, you know, send a message such that if she's loyal, reports it to the king,
it will, you know, get him on the defensive.
But also, if she's not loyal, reports it to Varick, Varick will erroneously think his
plans are going way better than they actually are, and then we'll show up, kick down the
door, and, you know, Scooby-Doo him.
Scooby-Doo him.
I'm unfamiliar with this.
Well, you know, I would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling dwarves.
Oh, okay.
Well, yes, they're all meddling dwarves, but, you know...
All the dwarves are meddling, yeah.
That's fair.
I don't know.
I think that's relatively safe.
We don't try to outsmart her or anything.
And either way, the message would serve our purpose.
Right.
That's exactly what I was thinking in terms of, like, just communicating a message that
will prompt a response from either person and alert us to where she's at before we really
give a lot of useful information.
Yeah.
So, I like that.
The issue with the parchment is that, so far as I remember, we have to be within a mile,
right?
No.
Oh, no.
Good.
No.
You can be any...
You could have the moment that you saw a dagger sheath.
You could have sent a message and let them know what was going on.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
So, it is not...
Oh, well, it's...
Okay.
It has no space limitation.
The only limitation is the...
Okay.
Okay.
...the writing surface itself.
Yeah.
There was a conscious decision on our part to not send it, because we didn't know who
to trust, because she was giving us the heebie-jeebie vibes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So...
That's true.
Okay.
Um...
So, yeah.
You seemed untrustworthy.
Uh-huh.
Now...
Okay.
So, I was under the assumption that we were working with the 10-mile rule there.
That was part of my...
Okay, so...
No, I'm sorry if I gave you that impression.
That was...
Well, I mean, it's what's on the parchment document, so I was just reading that.
That's my...
Well, I'm house-ruling it.
The whole idea was you guys had a form of being able to communicate with them at any point.
Gotcha.
Okay.
Yes, yes.
See, it really is a mile, but in this world, a mile is a unit of measurement roughly the size of the continent.
You're right.
Perfect.
There it is.
There it is.
Makes sense.
I keep having my back, Ramsey.
10 miles.
Yes.
That's Asia and Africa combined.
Right, right, right.
It's like a fathom or a league.
Who knows how long that is?
Nobody cares.
Right.
Not anymore.
Right.
Okay.
Yeah, so I think that sending a message, like you're saying,
Sentinels, Sentinels Rises has fallen.
I forget the name of the town that we were, the mining operation.
Dagger Sheath.
Oh, Dagger Sheath.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, Dagger Sheath.
Dagger Sheath burns.
Mm-hmm.
Sentinel Rises has fallen.
Yeah, and maybe something to the effect of that we're still a long way off.
Like we're trapped, you know.
Yeah.
Trying to make it sound like we're not going to get back, even though we really are.
Okay.
So, I'm going to need somebody to roll a deception here.
That's what I'm going to do.
Do you have to be deceptive in my writing?
Yes.
Oh, man.
Excellent.
Scott, is that a forte of yours?
No, I'm negative one on that one.
Excellent.
We're going to get Rurik a hero point as well.
Yeah.
Good job, Rurik.
Um, I am not at all, or no, I'm actually kind of deceptive.
I trained that.
Holy crap.
All right, sick.
Imagine that.
You've got something that comes in handy.
Oh, there it is.
A roguey kind of shoots-y guy.
Deception.
Weird.
All right, cool.
Uh, so, yeah, I will, I will do that, I suppose.
Distracting words.
Bam.
I, I lie.
I, I sure try.
All right.
I don't know how that went.
Okay.
I'm sure it went perfectly, though.
After, after, after a few minutes, um, you receive a response that is pretty brief.
Uh-huh.
Basically, uh, it basically just says, got your message, will let you know, kind of thing.
So, okay.
Um, so, in the meantime, uh, what are you guys going to do?
All right.
Well, um, we, uh, hold on.
We were sent here, just trying to remember, to chuck on this tower.
We found that it was splorked.
Did we already communicate back to the guy that sent us?
We did, in the tower.
I think so.
Okay.
All right.
Yep, we communicated with him.
He knows.
All right.
So, we need to hoof it back to, uh, to, uh, the capital, then to Hammer Keep.
I believe.
Iron Hold.
Not Hammer Keep.
Iron Hold.
Yeah.
Iron Forge.
That one.
It's not.
No.
It's Iron Hold.
It's not Iron Forge.
Oh, oh, oh.
So, legally distinct Iron Forge.
Hey.
Ramziah, I believe you had a map?
Uh, yes.
I did steal a map.
Oh, I didn't.
Yeah.
I didn't steal.
I traded for it.
You borrowed.
Yeah, you traded.
I traded for it.
He got a nice piece of chalk or something.
I don't know.
Um, and that was, that was showing, um, battle, battle play-ins, correct?
Yes.
Yes.
Uh, they were coming.
I'm looking at it now.
From the north?
Um, from Dagger Sheath, from somewhere up north was the, this is, uh, giant war camp?
I think that's what that says.
And then from an island, uh, kind of the northwest that is labeled Vargrom, which I don't think
we ever found out what the heck that's supposed to mean.
Uh, but yes, they're coming from three different directions.

All right.
We, we dealt with the, the group, theoretically, or at least in part, um, that was coming from
from the west, um, the south.
Dagger Sheath.
Mm-hmm.
That was from the south.
Dagger Sheath was south.
Yeah, Vargrom is to the west, and then there's also a assault that is expected to come from
the north based off of the, uh, based off the bow map.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Um.
Yeah.
Okay.
I'm, I'm wondering if trying to scout out the north to see if there's any activity or
movement there as we're heading, heading back toward Ironhold.
Um, I don't know.
Anyway.
Oh.
Let me see here.
Let's see if I can throw the map back out somewhere where you can see it.
You can start moving in the direction of the, uh, yeah.
Yeah.
I'm just concerned, um, in the event that the Spymaster is on Varric's side, there's no one
actually getting word to the king about what's going on.
I think my kind of first concern is making sure we physically confirm that word of the attack
is reached, uh, so they can start to defend.
Oh, hey, giant battle map.

That's the, that's the one.
Um, oh yeah, that does, does say a giant war camp.
I can make it bigger and it gets bigger.
Check that out.
All right.
I have, I have a boy that's insisting on going outside.
So, um, I'm still listening though.
So, yep, yep, 
So yeah, yeah, definitely start hoofing it there.
I forgot how far we were, but I know we have goats, so we're a little more faster and mobile
than we were walking around a bunch of civilians.
Yeah.
At this point, you're basically expecting to be able to get back around, um, in around,
uh, five days.
So.
Okay.
A work week is basically what you'd be looking at.
Um, you could do less if you push yourselves and push your goats, but there's, you know,
always the chance that you'll overexert yourself and end up having to take longer.
So.



I would be good, um, if we made a hard push for two days, um, with the expectation that
as we draw near, we're going to slow down and we're going to start trying to be a bit more
stealthy so that our, our scouts aren't intercepting us and potentially getting word back.
before we get to the gate.
So I, if I'm understanding you correctly, you're saying you want to push yourself for
a couple of days to gain, to gain some time so you can slow down and be cautious when you're
a little bit closer.
Right.
Yeah.
And, uh,
so.
We don't know how deep this deception is.
Or is it a spy master?
I keep thinking you're saying correct.
Thigh master.
But yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I feel he's got thighs of steel, man.
She's got a thigh.
Me, right?
Thigh master.
Yeah, so, um, I would like, like, us being us, the little slightly stealthy dwarves that
we sort of are, um, you know, like, I think we kind of have an understanding of, um, what
are sentinels and, um, rangers or whatever, you know, lookout types that we would have.
Like, we would know with those systems and processes, probably worked with some of them
over the years.
Um, so knowing, knowing that we would have an idea of what to be avoiding and where to
be avoiding and confusing our, our places.
Makes sense to me.
All right.
Is that the general consensus of what you guys want to do then?
Uh, yeah, I, I think so.
That sounds, sounds, sounds like wisdom to me.
Yeah.
Um, I am not in front of the computer, so I don't know skills.
Um, but I would be looking for a, um, a survival or an animal handling or some sort of wrangling
skill if Pathfinder has one.
Um, otherwise it would just be survival for you to, uh, be able to kind of push your animals
for the first couple of days.
Yep, 
Um.
Looking for something animal related.
There is.
In nature, there's command in animal.
Yep, 
That's just what I was looking at.
What is yours, Ramsey?
Two.
Ouch.
We are not trained in the nature.
Or the survival.
Yeah.
Nature plus ten.
All right.
Well, chances are Hurgen's not going to have a problem getting his animal to do whatever
he needs it to.
Yeah, I've got a plus eleven on that, so I'm, I'm right there with him.
Um, okay, so let me think here, um, group checks, group checks, um, trying to remember
all those, well, are either of you experts in nature or are you just trained?
I'm just trained.
Okay, well, that would, that doesn't make things easier on me.
Um, if you, if one of you were.
Is that true for you, Horgen?
Correct, 
Same thing.
Okay.
If one of you was an expert, then we could always do the follow the expert rules, but that
requires being an expert in it, um, okay, my boys both came in.
Maybe I can go and look up, um, group checks here.
Because I imagine that you guys aren't just going to be like, oh, well, you know,
Rook's falling behind, little sucks to be him, you know, I don't, I don't, I don't, I
imagine that you're going to be planning on traveling together, so.
Mm-hmm.
Grab, grapple, ride, grid.
Oh, she doesn't have group checks, why would you have group checks?
She would just make a really quick ruling here, and then we'll call it, we'll, we'll
call it what it is, so.
Anything, like, immediately available.
Go ahead, хозяe.
Yeah.
Go ahead, ㅋㅋㅋ
You.
Ok.
Yeah, we're gonna go through this.
We're gonna be back.
Wow.
How about you taşer in theiji LDL?
So what I'm going to do here is we're going to set a DC for a nature rule.
That DC is going to be 20.
Everybody needs to make that rule.
If we have the mechanics for each participating player can use a relevant skill.
So if Ramsey, if you've got an idea about a skill, something that you want to use that will help you push your animal that isn't specifically survival or isn't specifically nature, then you can feel free to use that.
DC will be the same.
Actually, we're going to make the DC an 18.
And then if you use any skill that isn't nature, the DC will be a 20.
But it has to be a skill that makes sense.
Sure.
In order for everything to succeed, I need everybody.
I need at least half the group.
So we need two out of three successes in order for you to not suffer any adverse consequences of pushing your animals.
Oh, right.
Right.
Um, I am going to say...
How do we do that?
They're rolling a...
I think for you, you just want to roll a nature because your nature is pretty good.
But, uh, you could use something else if you feel it is better, but it's going to be harder and it has to make sense.
Um, I'm going to say I, my nature is garbage.
Uh, I'm going to say I'm going to use a medicine.
Uh, so I'm kind of like, as I push the goat, I'm able to, you know, like monitor it and understand, you know, kind of when to kind of back down.
And when I can safely push, you know, kind of, uh, tell the state of the animal and then also, you know, as necessary when we stop and rest, you know, uh, do whatever I need to, to actually, you know, uh, get it fixed up.
Maybe I've got some herbs or I don't know, something.
Yeah.
All right.
Sounds good.
Okay.
Um, and also, um...
Oh, I rolled.
Oh, no, no, it's no big deal.
Um, I just wanted to throw out that if you did crit, if a critical success will count as two successes.
So, um...
Oh, sweet.
Looks like you guys got it without me, but it looks like I got it too.
All right.
We all did it.
Okay, so you guys are, you guys are all able to, uh, maintain a really aggressive distance.
You actually cover, um, about, um, cover about, um, three and a half days in that, in that first two days.
Be able to make it to the, uh, make it closer to ironhold.
So, you get, you get about, now you've got about a day and a half left in your travel.
So, um, and now you kind of scale it back and start being more stealthy.
Over the course of that time, you've been checking the parchment and the paper and that kind of stuff.
Um, and one of the things, uh, and you did end up getting a response.
Um, Spymaster Deep Shiver responded, um, letting you know that, um, that she consulted with the king.
Um, and that they are sending their full army to the south to assist you.
That's not great.
I want to see.
Yeah, there you go.
Um, that also doesn't help us, unfortunately.
Because, either way, that would be something she would do.
Could be.

She could be messing with you guys, or she could be honestly trying to help.
Well, uh, at this point, I, I don't see a recourse.
If the whole army goes south, we're, we're pants on screwed.
Uh, I think we have to, to let her know, uh, and risk it.
Um, I, I don't know.
I don't see a whole lot of option.
What do you, what do you guys think?
How far away are we?
About a day and a half.
Would the army go right past us where we could stop them?
Depending.
I mean, maybe.
You, but then they're going to be.
We wouldn't have the authority to do that, though.
Yeah, yeah.
And they're going to be, even if we did, they'd still be out of position.
Mm-hmm.
Right.
I mean, it's something that you guys do know.
Um, like, you received this follow-up message about, about a day ago.
Um, you can't, you can't muster an army on a dime, right?
So, um, it takes time to, um, to muster the army.
So, you might, it might, if you, if you continue at this pace, and you, you know, you know, just go balls to the walls, you know, and just keep going, then there's a chance that you'll get there before the army even leaves.
Um, if you proceed more cautiously, there's a chance that you'll be able to, that you'll be able to get there before the army, um, before the army is fully, um, evacuated from the city.
Um, or, uh, you know, or if you just proceed at a normal pace, um, like what Scott suggested, like, there's a chance that you'll run to the army on, on the way.
Um, but also, as was pointed out, like, you aren't, you, you don't have any authority in there, in the army.
However, you are the people that are, that they're supposed to be going back and assisting.
So, it might change things, might not, but it might.
So, there are kind of your three options here.
So, my, my immediate thought is to respond with a, a message, something to the effect of, muster the army, hold position.
Um, and retreating, or we could say that we broke through.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, my, I guess my thought is, if we, like the cost benefit, right, if we tell her that there's a tax coming from the north and the west as well,
if she's loyal to the king, if she's loyal to the king, that's good, right?
She'll retask appropriately.
And if she's disloyal, then the worst that happens is the army keeps heading south anyway, which is what it's currently doing.
Mm-hmm.
I don't know.
Um.
Or, yeah, we just don't reply at all and keep huffing it and try to just get there before anything happens.
Um, or to your point, you know, just send that message, tell her to, to hold the army there for now.
Um, hope she listens and then huff it anyway.
That's also not a bad option, and basically the same as not communicating at all, but still trying to huff it.
Mm-hmm.
What do you think?
I don't know.
So, I think she's not trustworthy.
So, catching her by surprise is not a bad thing.
Okay.
So, if we huff it, what's the worst thing that happens if we huff it?
We get caught by a giant and killed, or no?
I don't think, I don't think the giants are the problem.
The, the concern with huffing it is that we get spotted by our own scouts that then report to the spymaster who is dirty.
But, I, I think I'm less concerned about that than I am the army being several days out of position.
Yeah.
I would agree.
You know, and who knows?
The, the scouts even may not, you know, who knows?
That's not a sure thing.
Like, if we get spotted by our own scouts, there's, there's a lot of ifs that have to happen for that to turn out badly.
Yeah.
And it may not be the same.
It would be safe to avoid.
But, yeah, yeah.
They may not be able to send an accurate, clean message of our, our coming faster than we can get there.
Right, right, right.
If they, if they're not all equipped with parchment, I mean, it makes sense that they would be, but.
Well, maybe.
But, maybe not.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So.
I don't know, I don't know how rare or expensive this stuff is, so.
Right, right.
They certainly didn't seem to hand it out lightly to us, so.
We're right.
Yeah, so I, I'm in favor of, you know, we've, we've pushed it.
We've turned three and a half days into two.
Um, I would suggest that, in a day, we could be knocking on the door.

Okay.
Uh, just to give you guys a little bit, just to give you guys a little bit more of, uh, just more information.
Um, so, if you proceed with the pace that you're currently going, um, you will, uh, the, you will have to make another roll and the DCs will, will go up.
So, we're looking at, um, yeah, so we're looking at a 23 and a 20, uh, and a 25 in order to be able to, um, make it to iron hold, um, at, at the pace you're currently going.
Yep, yep, 
Okay, tough.
Yeah, and basically, kind of, at, at this point, it's more along the lines of, like, if you do get two successes, um, then no adverse effects, um, and for every success you get, you save yourself a half a day.
Um, so, up to a minimum of a half day.
I mean, you're not going to be able to get your travel time down to zero, being like, oh, and then you're there, you know.
So, but, um, yeah, so every success will get you a half a day.
You need two successes to make sure that there are no adverse effects to either you or your animals, um, and your DCs are 23 for, um, nature and 25 for medicine.
So, um, so, um, so, just keep that, you know, that, that, that, that, keep that in mind as far as your decision making is concerned as well.
So, 
It means, uh, like 12 or 13.

Maybe, uh, maybe a 15.

I don't know.
So, um, those odds are starting to get a little bit rough.
They are.
Uh, I've got a hero point, though.
Hmm.
So I'm, you know, not confident, but it's better.
Yeah.
Right.
Yeah.
And we are at the end of the, at the end of the night as well.
So if you guys, um, so, I mean, I think there are two people who still have hero points at this point.
So, uh, the, and you only need two successes to get there.
Give it a shot.
I'm leaning on.
We go for it.
Yeah.
It's also the most interesting.
Yes.
It's also the most.
You kill your goats is what the world wants to know.
Uh-huh.
And then start running.
Here it goes.
Yeah.
Oh, look at that.
No hero point needed.
Smashed it.
Oh, my gosh.
You did.
I just made it.
I wouldn't say smashed it, but did it.
Oh, I am not smashing.
Okay.
All right.
We needed two.
We got two.
We needed two.

All right.
So you guys are able to proceed forward.
Um, you do make it, um, you make it to the, um, the whole, the, the iron hold, um, gates.
Um, and given that we have four minutes to cut off, I think that this is an appropriate time to call it a night.
So you guys make it within eyeshot of iron hold.
You don't know what iron hold bolts and what's going to happen.
Um, you've not been encounter.
You, you've not been harried by any, um, by any scouts, but you have pushed your mounts to their limits and you've made it and you've made, you've made it to iron hold a five day journey in three days.
Great job, goats.
They are, they are some hearty goats you got there.
You know, these are, these are regular, like Rocky mountain, um, Rocky mountain rams.
Right.
You know, some longhorns.
Yeah.
The Rocky mountain longhorns.
Yeah.
Okay.
Boy.
Sweet.
Sweet.
Well, thanks guys.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Really appreciate you guys, you guys, uh, meeting up and, and hanging out.
Um, always a pleasure.
And, uh, Jason and Scott, sorry.
I was, sorry.
I was playing your characters for you in the combat.
I, uh, I'm working on it.
I don't need to be telling you every little thing, but I need all the help I can get.
It's totally fine.
Yeah.
Well, you know, what you say, knowing the system works and that, you know, like some of that's
technology stuff.
There were definitely things where like, I'm like, if Jason had, if, if we were on a, just
a paper grid and Jason, like a regular grid and Jason had a, a 15 foot, um, had a 15 foot,
um, template that he could just put on the grid.
Like he would know, and he wouldn't have done what he did.
And I would do, I would do.
Yeah.
I would have.
You're right.
Yeah.
So like, so I didn't feel, I didn't feel any kind of guilt around that whatsoever.
So, um, but yeah, I, I do, I do, I don't, I don't want, you know, people to just be like,
well, Chris just tells me what to do.
And that's what I do.
You know, I really want to give you guys the space to make your own decisions and things.
So, um, just need to be able to let things go sometimes.
Well, it was, it was a fun fight and, uh,
that was.
