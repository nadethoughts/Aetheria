Alright, so when last we met, the group of three dwarves were fleeing the war camp of
ogres, with 21 refugees, you all were ambushed by a group of wolves and a werewolf ogre, an
ogre werewolf, and were able to protect yourself and protect the group of dwarves from the threat
by defeating them.
You had continued on your way towards the guard tower that you were shooting for for the
nearest dwarven guard tower, which was a two-day force march.
You guys got to about three-quarters of the way through, and you were moving through a
clearing that had a large broken tree, and you had been eluding a drake, a red drake that
was hunting you.
And as you were crossing with the trees, you heard the telltale sign of a large skittering,
a noise of a skittering that of a large creature, and you saw a cyclops starting to, on top of
the large tree trunk, and that is where we landed.
I think you all had a few less hit points than what you currently do, but good for you.
I deleted the campaign and had to back it up, and the backup that I had, you had a lot more
hit points on, so you dodged the bullet with that one.
Woo-hoo!
I think I'm pretty close to what it was, after the healings and stuff that I had.
Yeah.
So, I think it got close, anyway.
Fair enough.
Maybe high, but close.
So, yeah, so you guys are walking along a huge tree trunk.
We're talking like redwood-sized tree trunk that has been felled.
High diameter?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
And you see these, and you see the cyclops on the top of the trunk looking down on you
at that moment.
We're going to go ahead and jump over to the battle map.
Done, done, done.
Duh!
I remember ruling pretty poorly to get to this place.
You actually did pretty well.
So, we were basically doing a thing where you had to roll five overall rolls, and I had
three encounters prepared for you.
You only failed two rolls, which meant that you still succeeded on getting, you know, you
still succeeded on navigating, but you did have, but you are having, you are running into
some enemies that are tracking you.
So, could have been far worse.
If you had rolled three or more, then you'll be, you would have been in a lot worse of a
position.
So, just so you know, you're not, you're not in bad, you're not in bad spot.
Just so you know, all right.
Just so you know.
All right, so to the north, that's where the tree is.
You probably are seeing, yeah, you are definitely seeing the cyclops on the top of the tree in
the north, northwest of where you guys are.
Um, it is, um, cresting the overall edge of the tree and getting ready to pounce.
Um, I'm going to need everybody to roll your initiatives.
Oh, I don't like that.
Ah, it almost rolled from a seven to a 17.
That would have been great.
Yeah, it would have.
At least you didn't get a three.
True.
Oh, yeah, sorry.
Here we are.
Roll.
Rolling.
Ooh, I got a two.
Huh.
That's surprising.
Wow, guys, you are doing amazing.
Right?
Right?
Highest die roll is a seven.
Delete the game again.
Maybe it'll reset it.
Well, if it's any consolation, the monsters rolled a three and then a four.
So nobody's rolling good initiative.
Yeah.
Yeah, I suppose that's fair.
All right.
All right.
All right.
So you, again, to the north, you look up and you see this cyclops cresting the tree.
Um, you do hear another creature in the background, um, and it is getting ready to pounce.
Uh, and Rurik, uh, you are, you are up.
What do you do?
Um, well, I mean, it's my one thing to do.
It's a hard decision here.
Uh, there he is.
Blast him.
Uh, I don't know of that.
My, uh, I rolled stealth for initiative because I'm always, uh, avoiding notice.
Um, so I don't know if that hides me from him or not.
Um, if that will inflict off guard or not, but it was not a good role.
So I am not hopeful.
Um, but he only has one eye.
So, you know, yeah.
So that, that, that, that clearly tracks that he would be bad at perception since he only has one eye.
Um, right.
Let's see.
You rolled a 22.
Go all Odysseus on him.
Take this one too.
Mm-hmm.
I am nobody.
Um.
All right.
Um.
I forget.
Ramsey, do you know, do you remember who wins ties?
The player, isn't it?
Um.
Um.
The person rolling, I believe.
Okay.
Yeah.
Because if you, if you meet the DC, you succeed.
So yeah, the person rolling essentially.
Which in this case would be me.
Okay.
Yeah.
So you did successfully hide.
All right.
Sick.
He is off the guard, which is fantastic.
Uh, all right.
Uh, we blast him.
We're going to shoot, uh, yeah.
Some fire rounds.
Sound great.
We have them loaded already.
So that's what we're going to do.
Um.
How?
Yes.
I would like.
Hello?
Ah.
Uh, there we go.
I have to click the right button, don't I?
All right.
Um, and then we need.
All right.
All right.
I've gone back to self-guard.
Plus two.
All right.
And.
Kaplow?
Mm.
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.
We're, we're going to spend that early.
Ah, that's much better.
Whoa.
Fair enough.
When, especially when you're a sniper and you get bonuses on the first attack you make,
uh, you really want that critical.
All right.
Um.
Blamp.
Uh.
Blamp?
Blamp?
Blamp?
Blamp?
Okay.
Blamp, blamp.
45.
All right.
I'll take it.
I'll take it.
Uh, cool.
Cool, cool, cool.
Uh, action two.
Uh, we're gonna stealth reload.
Uh.
45.
Um.
And then action three.
Do I really want to blast him again?
Or do I want to have a loaded weapon?
Uh, nope.
We're gonna try to blast him again.
That makes more sense, I believe.
All right.
Map.
Minus five.
Uh.
Big money, big money.
Hmm.
Doesn't look good.
Nope.
That did hit.
Sweet.
We'll take it.
Uh, hold on.
Let me make sure.
Yep.
One shot, one kill is off because I am not one shot, one killing here.
This is two shot, one kill.
Or maybe two shot, zero kill.
Damage did not roll well on that one, huh?
Ah, it's all right.
It's something.
Yep.
Yep, yep.
With my sniper shotgun.
I don't know how that works.
But it works.
Blam.
Blam.
All right.
All right.
So you see the, you see the Cyclops cresting the giant tree and you blast him twice.
Um, and he takes, and he takes the slugs, um, in his, uh, in his, uh, in his soft bits, but he continues to move forward.
All right.
He is not going to be happy with me.
I can only imagine.
He is very much not happy with you.
The other advantage of staying hidden, I guess.
You don't get retaliated if you're hidden.
Or at least not as hard.
Not as effectively.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Let's see here.
He's going to jump down.
Mm-hmm.
Um, were you successfully hidden?
Uh, I mean, I was, but then I shot him again.
So, no.
They're not.
Or actually, I don't know if I was or not, but I certainly am not now because I shot him again.
Okay.
So he's going to move down and he's going to target the guy that just blasted him.
Mm-hmm.
With his great axe.
Mm-hmm.
It's all right.
I am all nimbly bimbly, maybe.
He's a big feller.
He is.
This will hurt many hurts.
Mm-hmm.
Um, and he is going to actually target both, um, Hurrigan and, um, and, uh, Rurik with a mighty swipe.
Or just a regular swipe, but, you know.
Pretty mighty.
So he basically does a cleave.
Uh, through.
Uh, and he rolls a 20.
Excellent.
Which.
Misses both of you.
Excellent.
So he's very sad about that.
I mean, he has a lot of blood in his eye.
And then he's going to, well, I think that's all he can do because he's, uh, he moved and then he took a two action swipe.
So, that's, that's, that's his turn.
Yeah.
Okay.
Just got shot in the eye.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
All right.
You can hang it all.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
A giant spider comes across the, uh, comes, comes across the, um, trunk of the tree, and it targets her again, and turns around, and from its thorax, it spews,
It's going to use some sort of sticky concoction.
Yeah.
It's going to webbing you.
Oh.
Sure is.
All right.
And what that does, because it does hit you,
Um, it inflicts a web trap, uh, which means it immobilizes you.
Um, a creature hit by the ogre spider's web attack is immobilized and stuck to the nearest surface until it escapes with a DC-22 check.
So, you cannot move until you've succeeded in a DC-22 check.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
And...
It is also going to...
Um, it's going to...
It's going to...
No, I don't think it really can do much, much else.
Um...
I think it's going to stay where it is.
So, it will only take two actions.
And here again, you are up in your immobilized self.
How do I get out of this?
Uh, you will need to make a DC-22, um...
A DC-22 escape check.
So, I'm just going to go throw it, go ahead and throw that out in the chat.
Uh, you should see the escape DC-22.
If you click on that, it'll, uh, it should automatically make your rule.
And that will be one of your actions.
It just says escapes.
Is that the one you want me to do?
Yep.
Okay.
It should provide you some way of being able to...
Uh...
I clicked roll.
And I get this canceled as you must target before you attack.
Oh, well, just target the spider.
I guess.
I...
Try it one more time.
There we go.
Twenty-four.
Twenty-four.
Okay.
So, you did...
You did...
You did get out of the immobilized.
Um, so you were able to get...
Get yourself out of the webbing.
Now you have two more actions that you can spend.
Okay.
I can't hunt prey.
If I go on the other side of this guy, does that help at all, or should I just go up to him?
Um, well, it doesn't help you...
It doesn't help you specifically in this situation, but it would position you to be in a better situation if somebody should want to flank the guy and attack him.
Um, so, not a bad tactical move, but, um, it doesn't give you any inherent benefit right now.
Okay.
And my twin take-downs on a one-action only, right?
So...
Right.
Yep.
I can do that.
Because you OP...
Well, you're not OP, but, you know, you're pretty good.
I don't know.
Pretty dang good.
Yeah.
Sorry, I needed to click draw.
Always.
Now I can use this.
Well, one was a terrible roll, and one of them was a really, really good one.
That is likely going to be all it needs to be.
You did indeed kill the smoking axe.
The Cyclops.
Yay!
So how do you want to have killed him?
I don't even know what I can reach of him.
Maybe just the...
The artery in the leg.
Just like a really good left-handed smack to his big artery in his leg, and he bleeds out.
Right, so you...
So you slice...
Gunshot, wool.
Yeah.
Everything.
And he...
And he bleeds out.
Honestly, you could do a number of different things.
Like, you could just, like, have your guy kind of climb up him and chop up his head or whatever.
So whatever you think is cool, you can do.
But being...
But going through and slicing through the carotid artery and have him bleed out is pretty cool, too, so...
But regardless, he is dead.
He is dead.
And I'm done.
Awesome.
Demlor, you're up.
Hmm.
The Cyclops was just, um, attacked by both of your compatriots and destroyed.
But there's this giant spider that appears to be...
Spider.
Moving...
Moving around.
Yeah.
Um...
Well...
I think we'll probably target said spider.
And...
It's, uh...
I think we'll do the, um...
Magnetic pinions.
Spider.
I need some more holes in him.
Yeah.
He's not got enough.
Magnetic pinions.
Impulse attack.
Roll.
Modifier.
Do-blah.
Do-pa-de-doo.
What's the range on that guy?
60 feet is the range on that attack.
So I think I lost that.
Oh, look it.
I missed before the roll.
That's fantastic.
Do you wish to use your hero point?
Yeah.
Is it?
Or does it give me a chance to do that?
I thought that was in there.
Should I right click on the roll in the chat?
Yep.
Should be a re-roll with hero point option.
Re-roll with hero point.
Because I rolled even better that time.
You got the plus 10, though.
So it worked.
You successed.
Because the hero point gives you plus 10.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Yep.
So you hit.
So go ahead and roll damage.
Where is the damage rolling dice?
That is a good question.
I thought it would be in there.
I thought it would be in there as well.
I'm just going to do it this way.
That seems like a good idea.
Look at those ones and threes and fours.
All right.
There you go.
All right.
It's barely hurt, guys.
That's a three action move, must be, it looks like.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's what we got.
All right.
I think that closes my magnetic oars.
Oh, your gate.
Yeah.
It does.
All right, Ramsey, you're up.
All right.
Well.
Yeah.
Rurik is up, rather.
That spider is up directly after me.
So we're going to try to, I don't have a loaded weapon yet.
Well, nothing for it.
If I want to blast him, I guess.
I only get three actions.
So step one, we hide reload.
Boop.
Step two, we blast him.
How's my ammo doing?
Oh, we got plenty of ammo.
All right.
Step two, we blast him.
I do not know if that stealth roll makes me hit it or not, but I will let you figure that out.
Because I can't see it.
Yes, we are.
And blasting him.
Hmm.
Hmm.
It's good enough for a hit.
Good enough for me.
Wham!
Nice.
All right.
And then step three, we are going to hide reload again.
We will start with a shell in the chamber next round.
Ba-bam!
Okay.
Yep.
Fortunately, he does know where I am, but if that was a success, he will at least have to make a flat check to get me.
All right.
All right.
Well, he is up.
Mm-hmm.
I'm probably not real happy.
No.
Kind of moving a little bit behind some cover, but not so far that it can't get a bite in on one lovely hurrican.
Looks like a tasty morsel.
Mm-hmm.
He can bite from that far away.
Yeah, he's got a 10-foot reach.
Nom, nom, nom.
And he's going to be using that.
Right, man.
And missing horribly.
Oh, shoot.
Oh, he's going to try it for a second, nom.
Yeah.
He won't real bad.
Oh.
You might want to use a hero point.
I can't use a hero point.
I'm not a hero.
All right.
That's true.
That's the sucky thing about being a DM.
I don't get these lovely, I don't get these awesome hero points that you guys get.
So he, so he takes two bite attacks against Hurrican, but Hurrican, um, Hurrican steps out of the way for the first and then the second one.
Uh, the bite hits, but it, but it closes in on his leather armor and isn't able to penetrate.
Uh, so, uh, Hurrican, you're up.
What was that?
Oh.
Uh, he successfully uncaught himself on fire.
He's no longer on fire.
Stop, drop, and roll.
He did.
Fine.
Okay, so, Hurrican, you, the, the spider attacked you a couple of times, tried to bite you, but you're able to get out of the way, um, and now it is your turn to counterattack.
What are you going to do?
I got to move.
Oops.
I just don't know if I should hunt prey or not.
I mean, it's not, it's not a bad idea.
Okay, well, I'll take one of my actions.
And unfortunately, that might have already been on.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, so, one of your, one of your tasks hits, the other one doesn't.
Um, okay.
Fifteen points of damage.
And you hit with your fire axe, dealing fifteen points of damage, um, but not catching.
The ogre, the ogre spider on fire, it is still, uh, still reeling from a, or it's still succeeding from its stop, drop, and rolling.
That's me.
And Demlor, you're up.
I'm here.
All right.
So, you're, in order to do any of your kinestis things, you're going to have to attune with your gate again.
It'll.
So, that's one action.
Does it let me do it?
I keep clicking it, but it's not.
I think so.
I'm sure.
Uh, channel elements.
Yeah.
Actionability.
It just gives me the description.
I click it, and it's not doing anything.
Uh, click on the play button next to it.
All right.
Uh, probably need to get on my character sheet then, right?
Well, no, it's fine.
Uh, so if you're, if you're looking at channel elements, if you look to the right of channel elements, there's the little play button at the, at the edge.
If you click on that, that should make it run.
I'm not seeing a play button on my character sheet.
Um.
Oh, it's not on your character sheet.
It's on the, uh.
Yeah.
On your character sheet, you just want to click the use button.
All right.
I didn't see that either.
So, uh, in my actions, uh, ah, there you are.
Okay.
All right.
That's a single action.
That's a single action.
Okay.
Um.
We'll do an elemental blast.
I think I get a one action elemental blast.
No, I can do a two action elemental blast.
Yep.
You can do a full two action one.
Oh.
I'll go ahead and do that.
Maybe I'll do electricity.
Ooh, that sounds like fun.
All right.
And then I just click the button there.
Did I?
All right.
Good.
Just want to make sure I'm quick down my, my guy.
Yeah.
Whoa.
Man, look at that.
I haven't rolled above five yet this evening.
Just.
Oh, man.
Just.
Yeah.
We're all on the same page.
Oh.
Oh.
Great.
That's all I can do.
So.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I would say neither is Chris, but that doesn't, doesn't help you any.
Yeah.
That.
That probably does not make you feel better that I have been having just as bad of luck
as you.
Oh.
The consistency of it's the thing that's frustrating.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I wouldn't, I wouldn't mind it if I didn't, you know, roll above a five, if I, you know,
occasionally rolled above a 15.
Right.
Right.
Right.
It seemed balanced.
Mm-hmm.
Anyway.
All right.
So that's my turn.
So, um, back to Ramsey.
All right.
All righty.
Well, uh, I had one in the chamber, so we're, he's not looking good.
We're just gonna, we're gonna try to put him down.
This rabid animal needs to be euthanized.
Yeah.
Oh, nice.
Oh, that should do it.
Beautiful.
Nice.
Nice.
It hurts.
It hurts.
It hurts.
It hurts.
Let's see here.
Yep.
All right.
How do you want to have killed?
That will do it.
So, um.
Splendid.
I think we'll, we'll continue with the eye theme.
Um.
Since spiders, the cyclops had too few eyes.
Spiders have way too many eyes.
Um.
Uh.
So this is a shotgun blast.
I, I've kind of figured some of the metal pointy bits that Demolore stuck in them earlier
may have taken out an eye or two.
Uh.
But we'll kind of finish the job with a shotgun blast.
Um.
Take out three meaning eyes and what was left of the brain behind them.
And.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right.
Everybody with bullets.
Sounds good.
Well, on the bright side, nobody actually took any damage in this severe encounter.
Which is, which is great.
Because, uh, I've already used battle medicine on everyone.
So.
Yeah.
It would have to be a stop to, uh, to heal.
Yeah.
But.
So, um, you guys, you guys, uh, take a look at the, um.
Um, the.
Remains, um, and I actually, like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm just gonna drop all the treasure
from last time and this time into the chat.
So.
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
You're gonna kind of get hit by a lot of treasure right now.
Yep.
Yep.
Yep.
Don't.
Don't freak out.
As long as it doesn't do any damage.
Don't get hit by it.
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
Ow.
All right.
So, you are able to find a Thundercrasher Boots of Free Running Lesser, a Bane Rune for a weapon, a Reactive Flash, a Recording Rod that is reusable, some Cloud Buns, some Journey Bread of Power,
some Bane Oil, and Life-Boosting Oil, as well as 200 Gold Pieces.
Nice.
Scoop up the gun. That seems appropriate.
Ramsey, I didn't make that for you.
That was supposed to, no, no, I'm just joking.
Excellent. I'm all a blast.
I've not even actually looked at it yet. I just saw a gun.
No, it, yeah, it is for sure a U thing.
I was, I was just giving you a little bit of a hard time.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, that's neat.
Yeah.
These boots are cool.
Yeah.
That is cool.
I want vertical surfaces. That's sick.
Well, I do not think I need them.
Certainly.
That's cool.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's cool.
Yeah.
That's cool.
Wow.
Reload.
Reload.
So, once you guys have gotten, gotten everything figured out about what you're, what you're picking up and what you're running with, let me know.
Um, I don't want to rush you, I don't want to rush beyond you, having picked up all your gear in gold.
So, between the three of you, the 200 gold pieces should divide out to something.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Around something.
200 divided by three.
Sixty-six gold pieces apiece with somebody, um, with sixty-seven.
Yeah.
With somebody getting sixty-seven.
I'll give them to Ramsey.
What's cool?
He did all the killing.
Sixty-seven.
Two people with sixty-seven.
Sixty-seven.
What are cloud buns?
These are delicious food.
Like, what, you fly?
We're just sick.
Oh.
Minced meats.
Spices and herbs.
Yeah.
So, two of you should have sixty-seven gold, and one of you should have sixty-six.
Is basically what that will equate to.
Oh.
Meat.
Journey bread of power is also cool.
Bane oil.
Yeah.
Bane oil.
So, Bane oil does a similar thing to Bane, only it's...
One time.
One time.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Which is still good, so...
Yeah, yeah, it is.
Sure is.
I get fast healing three.
Okay.
Hmm.
Well, that's cool.
All right.
Well, um...
You don't have a weapon, right, Jason?
Correct.
Okay.
So...
The weapons here are of interest to me.
So, Scott, one of us should take the Bane rune, the other should probably take the oil.
Doesn't really make a difference to me, which...
Actually, it makes much more sense for you to take the Bane rune.
I'll take the oil.
That's what I was thinking.
Yeah.
Okay.
So, when you want to take it, you just grab it?
Yep, yep.
Just drag and drop it into your character, your inventory.
Consumables.
Bane oil.
Oh, I do still have that, don't I?
And this.
What does this do?
Um...
Oh, hey.
Cool.
Um, I've already got a bit of a healing thing, so someone else can take the life-boosting
oil.
Um, the reactive flash, I think, only is good for you, uh...
Uh...
Uh, Scott...
Still trying to figure out how to get the things in there.
Let's see.
Just...
Just click and drag it over into your character sheet, and it should drop it in your inventory.
Oh, it did.
Okay.
I'm sorry, I didn't see it at first.
Yep.
Got it.
Um...
React.
I...
Upped my gold stash by 67 gold.
Okay.
It's FYI.
It doesn't look like there's any way to take that, actually.
So I'm just writing it in.
Oh, no.
It's not a merge rusher.
Yep.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Um...
The boost of free running could really be useful for, I pretty much think, anybody in the group.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I am very happy with my mobility.
Like, I've got that feat that lets me, like, jump higher by rocket boosting.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
So maybe one of you guys take the boots.
The other person maybe take the cloud buttons to get some fly if you need to.
I'll take the boots of running freely.
Okay.
Done.
Um...
And then these journey breads of power, I think, are going to be most useful in just helping us get to the place.
Um...
We are...
Okay.
Well, just refresh me for a minute.
We are currently trying to get to...
I think it was a watchtower of some kind?
It was some kind of safe spot.
Mm-hmm.
And then the idea was to leave the survivors and the three of us haul ass all the way back to the kingdom, right?
That was the plan?
Yep.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
So these journey breads of power can help us on that leg of the journey once we don't have the normies slowing us down.
Mm-hmm.
Um...
Whoever of us needs it the most can use those.
So I guess I'm just going to grab both of them for now, but they will be used by whoever needs them.
I just want to make sure we have them somewhere.
Journey bread.
Yeah.
Uh...
Somebody grab the recording rod.
Only it matters which one.
Somebody grab that.
That's going to be probably useful for when we get back to the place.
Uh...
We can maybe...
Trick someone into revealing too much information.
Hmm.
Sneaking.
Although none of us are really good at the tricking.
But...
No.
No.
You never know.
No.
Well, I mean...
We can maybe intimidate someone.
If too.
I mean...
I mean, there was...
There was supposed to be a fourth player that was a fighter paladin.
Right.
That had a decent charisma.
Yep.
That that could have been useful for me.
All right.
All right.
Best laid plants.
Yep.
Yep.
Yep.
Yep.
But I'm sure you guys will find some...
I'm sure you guys will find some use for it anyway.
Oh, yeah.
For sure.
You guys are plenty creative, so you should be able to handle them.
Yep.
All right.
Well, if we got...
If we've got that, I think that's pretty much everything.
Okay.
Did everybody increase their gold by 66 or 67?
Yep.
Yep.
I did 66.
Right.
Okay.
Okay.
So, you guys...
You guys finished looting the ogre and the...
And the ogres...
Or the cyclops and the ogre spider.
Yeah.
And move...
And move...
More towards the...
Towards the watchtower.
After about three or four more hours of...
The force march with the 21 dwarves in tow.
You actually see the beginnings of...
An intro to the watchtower.
It takes you about another half hour to get to where they are.
Where it is.
But as you approach, there are a number of dwarves that come out of the watchtower with concern in their eyes.
And come to kind of help the refugees make it back into the tower.
The tower that you guys have made it to is the tower called Hammergate Hold.
Go ahead and throw that up in the chat.
Not that that will matter too much to anybody.
But if you want to jot it down.
You have reached Hammergate Hold.
That's a pretty little watchtower.
Yeah.
Yeah.
After a few minutes, the overall...
The wounded and really bedraggled looking group of dwarves get pulled into the actual watchtower itself.
And are given soup and broth and basically started...
There are some medical dwarves that are there.
Some clerics that start taking a look at nursing them back to health.
The captain of the tower approaches you and says,
Hello.
Well, he probably doesn't say hello.
That seems very informal, depending...
Considering the way that you guys were...
The way that you guys brought some...
Brought some refugees back.
He walks up to you and says,
I am Captain Thrain Emberhelm.
Captain of the watchtower.
Captain of Hammergate Hold.
What has happened that these dwarves are in such bad shape?
Okay.
Dude, you would not believe the stuff we've been through.
What did happen?
One-eyed orcs.
Lots of orcs.
Can't remember all the spaces, but they took over the...
The wood camp.
Demmler kind of gives a little bit of a...
With Demmler clearing his throat,
you have gotten Captain...
Captain Emberhelm's attention.
Full attention.
Yeah.
He kind of goes back and forth between Rurik and Hergen
as they're giving pieces and bits of information,
and he's just like kind of trying to process what they're saying,
but not really able to kind of comprehend what's happening.
And then Demmler, you clear your throat,
and he narrows in on you and says,
what do you have to say?
I think we were still being hunted by a drake.
We might have one of those yet on our tail.
Yeah.
I don't know what you've got for fortifications here
and how long you can hold out,
but there's a lot of wicked
that's been running behind us.
Get yourselves ready.
He looks you up and down.
And...
He says...
Are you Demmler?
I give a...
courteous bow and smile.
The Slayer of Orcs?
Yeah, the title's probably not deserved.
Oh, come now.
The orcs would say otherwise, if they could.
He chuckles.
He says, very well.
Very well.
And he basically calls a few of his lieutenants,
points up to the top of the tower,
and says, keep an eye out for a drake,
or anything else that may be coming in the same direction as these.
And then he calls a few other people,
a few other dwarves over,
and says, send word to the other frontier watches that something's afoot.
And I will need to have a more coherent conversation with these heroes
before I can give further instruction,
but at least put them on alert.
Something is... something's up.
And the other dwarves go into a separate room.
As they close the door,
you kind of see a...
what looks to be like a...
not a seeing stone,
but like a sending stone
that's on a pedestal
that they are using
to communicate with other watchtowers in the region.
Yeah.
And then he looks at...
Then he looks at you three and says,
come to my office.
Let's have a chat.
And he walks to a separate room
that is on...
that's on the exterior wall of the watchtower.
And he expects you to follow.
As we're heading along,
Demers, just remember, we don't know
who's on what side.
And we need to get to the, you know,
king as quickly as possible, so...
Yeah.
We need to...
We need to give them enough information
to take care of themselves,
but we need to get on...
on the way also.
So...
So...
Yep.
We can't be long.
We've been...
Have we been two nights without sleep?
I think so.
Two nights without sleep.
Right?
I think so.
It's been a full two nights without sleep.
Okay.
So maybe a sleep here...
Maybe a sleep here is a really good idea.
Would be good.
In a safe spot.
Right.
Can we still have our...
So...
Sorry.
Go ahead, Chris.
No, no.
Please, please.
Go ahead.
I was just going to clarify.
We still have our goats, right?
Yes.
Yeah.
You...
We were just slowed down
by the people without goats.
Correct.
Yep.
Correct.
All right.
Yeah.
I definitely don't think
that you're going goatless.
Mm-hmm.
Nobody's got your goat.
Yep.
Nobody's got your goat.
All right.
Cool.
So he...
He goes into his office.
You guys follow.
He comes...
He...
He comes to...
He...
As you walk in,
you see a...
A very...
A very...
Minimalist office.
There is a...
Desk and a chair...
Um...
With some...
Stacks of paperwork,
but...
Everything is very...
Well-managed and well-maintained.
He walks around the...
He walks around the desk,
sits down.
Um...
He has no additional chairs
in this, uh...
Office.
It's definitely...
One of those situations.
As you guys have been around the military
here and there...
Um...
You know that, like,
in these sorts of situations,
it's like...
Standing reports sort of thing.
Um...
The sort of thing that happens.
So...
Um...
He basically...
Gestures you to...
You know,
come in front of the desk.
Um...
He pulls out a...
Quill and some paper...
And says...
All right.
I'm gonna need...
A full report.
What is it...
That we're looking at here?
To begin.
What's the danger?
And his...
Quill is poised at the top of the paper...
Um...
Ready to write.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Um...
What the...
Well...
Um...
You remember...
Hmm...
Hmm...
Oh, did I write it down?
I did not write it down.
Dagger sheath.
I did write it down.
Do you remember...
Dagger sheath?
To the west of here?
I know it.
Well...
That's all anyone's gonna be doing...
About it for a while.
Remembering it.
There ain't nothing left.
What do you mean...
There's nothing left?
I mean...
The people that we've walked...
Into this tower.
I mean...
That's the last of them.
No one else survived.
What happened?
Was it...
Was it...
Dragons?
You mentioned a Drake.
I'm gonna...
I'll look at...
Look at everybody...
Trying to weigh...
How much to say...
But...
Um...
No...
No...
It's...
Ogres.
Far as we can tell.
We haven't had ogres in this region for...
A long time.
But...
Hundreds of years.
But maybe...
Um...
After all...
There is...
Definitely...
Uh...
Much has changed since the flaming retribution.
Maybe there was an ogre tribe that moved up here.
But usually they're not organized enough to be able to...
Actually...
Be able to attack and...
And...
Raze an entire city or entire town.
Quite a few of them.
Ha ha ha.
We...
We managed to thin out a few.
But...
Uh...
There's...
There's quite a lot of them out there.
And they're...
Probably not happy.
I don't know...
They...
Had our scent.
I don't know if they still do.
But...
I...
Yeah.
Webber behind some thick walls.
Wait.
Is that...
The...
All kinds of bad that you...
All kinds of bad that you...
All kinds of bad that you...
I mean...
Yeah.
That about sums it up.
I had some other creatures with them too.
Weird.
Big spider.
One-eyed looking ogre thing.
Uh...
Ogre...
Werewolf?
That one was odd.
That was weird.
Wait.
What?
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
He's dead though.
Don't worry about it.
Right.
He's dead.
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry.
Okay.
Start from the beginning.
What's going on?
I gotta look at the other two and I'm like, I'm like, I thought I was being pretty clear
here, but maybe someone else can help me out.
Give me five minutes, give me five minutes, give me five minutes, you stay here, and I'll be right back.
And he basically leaves the room.
Excellent.
I immediately start going through his death drawers.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, you go through his death drawers.
Go ahead and roll me your perception.
Yeah, yeah.
And let me know what you're specifically looking for.
Or what sorts of things you're specifically looking for.
So I'm specifically looking, wow, that's a pretty decent roll.
So I'm specifically looking for anything that might be incriminating if he is on the wrong side of this thing, as we suspect some people are.
Okay.
Barring that, I'm looking for anything shiny.
You want to loot the desk.
Exactly.
Okay.
I'm mainly looking for evidence, but, you know.
Fair enough.
Fair enough.
So what you do see, or what you are able to pull out, you see a...
You don't see anything that's specifically incriminating.
What you do find are military reports, reports received from other watchtowers and reports that, and copies of reports that are sent to other watchtowers,
as well as, you know, the king's orders and operations and that kind of stuff that comes from the generals and military leads that are signed by the king and that kind of stuff.
As far as shiny things are concerned, you don't find a whole lot.
There's like 50 gold in there, but nothing that's like, you know, anything that's specifically like useful other than money.
Sure, sure, sure, sure.
Uh, so Rurik, as he's kind of rifling through stuff, um, uh, I'm trying to think what could be in a medieval desk drawer.
Um, maybe...
Yeah, sure, that makes sense.
Nah, nah, that's too useful.
There definitely is like a, like a wax, like there, there's definitely like wax and a wax seal, um, stamp on there, um, as well as like ribbon and that kind of stuff that are used to, um, that are used to seal orders.
Um, there's, um, there's a stamp of, you know, uh, of like the, this specific watchtowers emblem, like each watchtower has its own specific like, um, stamp, um, that they put on official documents and that kind of stuff.
So it's got that, um, that element in there as well.
So those sorts of like office materials, quote unquote, office materials are, are definitely present.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay.
All right.
Um, I think the thing that would stand out to Rurik the most is just the wax itself.
Like, Ooh, that's some really nice wax.
Uh, I'm going to pocket some of that and I will trade him, uh, for this, uh, cool.
Hoster that I picked up from the forge's fire.
Okay.
I'm just going to leave that in the desk drawer and take a stick of wax.
Okay.
And, um, while Rurik is rifling through the drawer there, um,
I am, I am going to, uh, just play around, mess with him a little bit, uh,
Uh, when he looks back up onto the desk, the fountain and the, the quill will be of, uh, they'll be complete gold.
Okay.
They're just covered.
Everything's covered in gold.
Uh, what the?
Uh, I, that was a place that I'm talking to go.
I know.
That could be worth something.
Hulk at it.
Could be, but it's not.
Ah, how did, how did you do that?
You gild that so fast.
It's your fanciness, isn't it?
That's neat.
Uh, wiggles his fingers and the, the gold bleeding disappears.
Uh, you can make anything treasure if you want.
Ah, that's a neat trick.
All right.
Uh, we are at the hour mark for, uh, for the hero points.
I'm going to be awarding a hero point to Demlor.
Demlor.
I thank you.
Be sure to use it soon.
All right.
All right.
Um.
It's funny.
Yeah.
Oh, I guess.
So, uh, after, after around five, 10 minutes, um, if you guys have anything else to do,
um, the, uh, Captain Emberhelm will come back, but don't want to rush you.
Um, no, like, I mean, you're, you're kind of telling about as much as you can.
And I think that, you know, the, the stronghold is, you know, whatever that, the town there,
um, cause it's not there anymore.
And it was ogres.
Um, we haven't mentioned anything about, um, the giants.
And I think that that's probably the wiser.
Keep that one a little close as well as our suspicions of, uh,
the, the more traitorous elements.
Right.
And so I'm, I'm liking the, you know, like the account so far is sufficient.
So.
All right.
Uh, so he comes back after about five, 10 minutes.
Comes back in and looks at the three of you and says, well, we've spotted your Drake.
It appears to have, um, seen that it was spotted and decided to go the other direction.
Um, um, guess it didn't want to get within range of our tributes.
Um, smart move.
We sent out a, um, a scout, um, to head to check out, uh, any, any pursuit that you might have.
So we should know pretty soon whether or not there are any, uh, whether or not these, these ogres are, are hot on your trail or, um, if they've lost interest.
And, uh, we have sent out, um, alerts to the remaining watchtowers on, in the frontier to make sure that they keep an eye out for, um, ogre attacks.
We've also requested reinforcements from some of the interior watchtowers, um, to be able to, um, fend off any, uh, any onslaughts that we have.
We are, we are, we are just a watchtower.
We aren't a full mill.
We aren't a full military.
So, uh, we'll need any help that we can get to, um, to be able to stave off this ogre, um, this ogre infiltration.
Um, is there anything else that, um, that you three can, any additional information that you three can?
You can provide to me in order for us to be better prepared for what lies in wait or, or for what lies ahead.
Best we can say is be prepared for anything.
That's yeah.
It's been wild.
What's what we've seen.
Stuff out of myth and story.
Duh.
Um, the, the ogres did, um, have some kind of shaman, maybe, I don't know, some kind of magic user.
Um, I don't know what they were doing, uh, but they were somehow like mind controlling some dwarves.
Uh, so maybe look out for that too.
That doesn't sound like that.
That's, that's terrifying.
They're different though.
They stood out.
They stood out.
They stood out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They were like fiery dwarves.
Ogres don't have that kind of magic.
Well, that's what we thought.
We're someone who does.
The, um, Captain Emberhelm basically just puts his, puts his head, puts his hand on his head.
Closes his eyes.
Takes a few minutes and says, well, just yesterday I was telling the boys that's things were too quiet around here.
Not your mistake, you should never say that out loud.
Never say that out loud.
I should have washed my mouth.
All right.
Um, well, the, the three of you look like you're beat.
You're, you look like you're beat to heck.
Um, why don't you go ahead and take some, take some time to rest up?
Um, is there anything that you need at this point, uh, that we can provide to you?
You've provided plenty of information for us.
Um, is there anything that we can do for you?
Um, I would say what we need more than anything is a place to sleep.
Um, that you have, I wouldn't, um, I wouldn't use your rations or food.
You're going to need that.
I think more than we do.
Very well.
People will tend door goats while we sleep.
What?
Yeah.
All right.
The, uh, the, um, the bunks are over there.
Um, we do have, we, we don't have, we don't have much.
I know that you didn't specifically, uh, or you specifically said you don't need rations,
but we do have, um, we do have, um, and he, he says gruel, but gruel is not necessarily
a bad thing in this context.
It's, it's basically military rations that are, um, that are good and filling and not
like, it's not the best, it's not the best flavor in the world, but they're like MREs,
right?
So they're definitely, they've got all the nutritional value that you're going to need
to be able to do a full, to be able to do a full March, um, in, in food form.
Um, they're like, they're not the best tastings in the world, but they're also not like, you
know, nasty.
They're like, you know, okay food that is specifically designed for military, um, military marching
and, and events and that kind of stuff.
And he said, we've, we've got mess hall takes, um, takes place at, um, at around 5 PM or the
equivalent of 5 PM.
You're welcome to, you're welcome to partake.
Um, we have, uh, we have plenty and we're, and we're not going to be, we're not going
to be running out anytime soon.
Um, until then we're, we're waiting for the, we're waiting for the runner and the scout to
come back.
Um, feel free to rest up.
Um, and we'll also look, we'll also try and see if we can hear back from the, uh, from the
other watchtowers to see if we can provide any additional information to corroborate your
stories.
And with that, he basically points you at the bunks and lets you have at it.
So, sounds good.
All right.
Uh, anything else that you guys want to do before you, before we move forward to the next
day as, as you sleep off your two days of not sleeping?
Nope.
Nope.
I think all Rurik wants to do is find a nice soft pillow.
Right.
Uh, you guys are definitely, uh, you, you are able to find some bunks that meet your needs.
Um, especially considering that for the past two or three weeks, you've been sleeping on
nothing but ground, um, soft patches of ground and, um, the backs of rams or the backs of goats.
Um, what you find in this, uh, in this barracks is, um, more than adequate for what you need in
order to be able to get some, get a good refreshing sleep.
Um, so y'all complete a full, a full rest.
Uh, which if you go into the extras section of your character sheet or not your character
sheet, your, uh, character HUD in the bottom, there's the three boxes at the bottom stacked
in a triangle.
So if you click on that, that's the extras section and there's a rest for the night option.
If you click on that, that will perform all of the nightly rest things for you.
Um, you do heal a little bit and that kind of stuff.
So, um, um, you all wake up the next day, um, not fully rested, but rested enough to be
able to, um, continue on, on your journey.
Um, as you start prepping yourself in, in ready to go, uh, getting ready to go, um, captain
Um, Amber Helm approaches you and says, I have some things that I would like to debrief
you on if you have a moment.
Interesting.
Um, he says, we have confirmed your ogre army.
Um, they are on the move.
Um, they are, they are less than a day's march from this, from this watchtower.
Um, they would have, um, had you delayed any longer, um, we would have ended up, um, you
would have arrived on the other side of the army, um, which would not have been good for
us.
So we appreciate your, uh, your forewarning.
We've also received, uh, we've also received word from the other watchtowers that there are,
um, other military, um, units and things that are moving, um, towards the individual watchtowers.
They've all sent out scouts and found things coming back.
Um, although we have not heard back from one of our watchtowers.
Um, called the sentinels rise.
Sentinels rise has not returned any information to us from, since our original, uh, since our
original statement to them, we sent them message, letting them know, um, we received an odd
message in return, um, saying that they were under orders, um, they were under orders to
stay, um, to stay where they were and not provide support.
Um, and, uh, that was the last we heard from them.
Um, uh, they are to the north, uh, they're to the northeast of here.
Um, um, I'm concerned that my fellow captain, um, Captain Ironbrow is, uh, compromised and the
watchtower is fallen.
Um, they don't usually, um, they don't usually, uh, we, we have a certain amount of, um, expectation
from each of the watchtowers to keep in constant, um, constant, uh, communication.
Um, if one fails to send a, um, since fails to send a communication, um, we, at the very
least, send a scout to assess whether or not the watchtower itself has, um, fallen to, um,
an enemy or not, but as you can, um, as you can imagine where we are right now, we can't
really afford to, to send anyone.
Um, I know that you are on your way to Ironhold, um, but would you be willing to head by way
of that watchtower, it's only a few hours out of your way, um, to make sure that nothing
bad has happened, uh, to them and be able to send word back using the sending stone in
the tower itself.
Time is of the essence, but you, ours, I think we can spare.
What do you, what do you think?
I think so.
Can you give us a quick lesson on how to use your sending stone?
Of course.
Um, he will run you through the actual process of using the sending stone, um, it's actually
pretty simple, uh, there's a command word that you have to use in order to be able to
activate it, and then you just simply say the watchtower, uh, the, the name of the watchtower
that you're wishing to communicate with, and then it will open up the, the channel.
Um, yeah.
Um, something that, uh, just, just as a, just as a side note for, um, for you guys, like,
you do find it odd that, um, well, and this is actually probably, um, pointed out by Captain
Emberhelm as well, um, um, it's odd that a, that a specific watchtower would be under orders to, um,
to stay where they are.
That, that's not, that's not a common order that happens to watchtowers, but it is something
that is overly, it is something that is, um,
made to be a, it, it is something that can be done, it's non-standard, um, so it's not,
it's, it's not, like, unusual in that nobody ever does it, but at the same time, it's also
not a standard, uh, a standard standing order, um, for the watchtower to, um, basically be,
um, on hold or in, the best term that I can come off with is, like, a turtle pattern where it's just,
like, stay where you are, don't, you know, don't, um, don't assist other watchtowers, you know,
hold, hold up, you know, board, board up, and, and don't, and don't let anything in,
um, sort of thing, um, that is a order that is possible to be delivered, but it's not a common
one, so that may, that may also be something that kind of piques your interest from a investigation
perspective.
Certainly does.
All right, well.
You should be good to go, yeah?
Yep.
All right, so, uh, he gives you, yep, so he gives you, he gives you instructions on, um,
where to go to the watchtower.
It, it, it does require you to double back a little, um, double back a little bit, like
you'll, not double back as in, like, going back right now, but you'll have to go up, go
to the watchtower, and then double back a little bit in order to be able to get back on the trail
to get to iron hold.
Um, so you guys proceed towards that, towards that watchtower.
Um, as you go, um, you make it through a, um, you make it through the countryside.
There's, there's, um, you do notice that this, um, specifically like Kerrigan, you would
notice that this is a little bit more, um, quiet, um, than you would expect for the nature
that's around you, um, the actual, uh, the actual, uh, forest and, and mountain usually
has a little bit more wildlife than what you're currently experiencing as you're, as you're
walking in, so it's, it's a quiet, almost too quiet sort of situation, a little bit, yeah,
a little bit unsettling for you.
Um, on your way, you happen across a interesting ancient relic, um, in the, in the forest.
Um, it looks like it's, um, a collection of stone rings, um, just kind of strikes you as,
um, structures odd, um, this actual relic itself is, um, are the, the rings of, um, the rings
of Coram.
They are a dwarven relic that you guys have heard of.
Um, it's not a, it's kind of like one of the monuments in the United States, right?
For, you know, like the Washington Monument or, or the, uh, or, um, Mount, uh, what's it
called?
Yeah.
Mount Rushmore, you know, that kind of thing.
So it's something that, you know, by, um, by reputation, if you haven't seen it in person.
Um, but this is on the way to the, uh, to the actual, um, tower itself.
Um, as you approach it, uh, you see that there seems to be, um, some recent movements, um, around
it, it's not like as overgrown as usual, um, there definitely appears, like there definitely
appears to be, um, or as usual, quote unquote, it's not as overgrown as you would expect it
to be.
Um, the, the, there are definitely appears to be some, some traction, some, some grass that's
been beaten down, it definitely appears like there's, there's been some movement around
here, um, more so than just like somebody walking through and just being like, oh, this
is really cool, you know?
Um, but outside of that, nothing really out of the ordinary about this, about this monument,
um, other than just being a really cool thing.
Uh, it's basically a collection of rings, as you can see in the pictures, like there's a
collection of rings that are kind of built into the ground, um, with some runes along the
rings, like magic runes, and on the four corners of the, um, of the cardinal directions of the
outside of the rings, there are what look to be like these stone gates.
Um, and you can see an example of one of those, um, over here, to the right-hand side.
Pretty cool thing.
Oh.
You know.
Yep.
You don't really have much time to spend ogling this, however, so you really do need to move
forward, but it's definitely something that seems interesting.
Um.
You make it to the dwarven, uh, to the dwarven watch house, uh, watchtower.
Um.
For Captain Ironbrow, um, the watchtower of...
...the sentinels rise.
Yes.
Um.
And you, um, see that the watchtower itself has definitely seen battle.
Um.
The, there are, um, there are a couple of, there are a couple of survivors, um, how do you
think, however, this is definitely something that the dwarves have, have fought very hard
against something.
And while there are survivors, there aren't anybody who's specifically conscious.
Like, you, there are a couple of people that, uh, there are a couple of dwarves that are unconscious,
lying about, um, but not quite dead.
And there are, um, and there are definitely, like, other dwarves that have been, that have been, um, murdered.
Uh, you do see the telltale signs of larger footprints and, and more giant, um, more giant-sized things in there.
Um, but you also see, um, something different than what you saw at Dagger Sheath, being that Dagger Sheath was burned.
And this place appears to have been bouldered, um, attacked by the Earth itself, as well as burned.
And, um, and, uh, the, you're seeing, and you also see some overgrown, uh, some, it's almost like the force itself rose against it.
Um, so, like, there's, like, this overgrown nastiness there, um, as well as, um, as well as, like, the scorch marks.
And there's also, like, there's also, like, some elements of, like, um, almost, like, pieces of stone were, like, shattered, like glass kind of thing.
Um, um, so, it appears that there's, like, some sort of odd magical elements to this, as well as it just being an onslaught attack.
Uh, sorry, my, uh, computer just completely shut off.
Oh, neat.
Randomly.
Uh, which I don't understand, because it was, like, it's plugged in, so it's not like the battery died.
Like, I don't know what happened.
It decided you were done, Jason.
I guess so.
Um, so, anyway, we've arrived at the Watchtower, and it's in ruins, and there seems to be some, uh, traces of, uh, magic surrounding it.
Giants.
Correct.
Correct.
And some, and some telltale signs of giants that you guys have seen elsewhere.
Mm-hmm.
They are on the move.
Yep.
Uh, so, uh, what are you guys going to do at this point?
Out of bed.
Right?
Fair enough.
It is 10 o'clock.
Is the Watchtower something that can be entered at this point, or is it pretty, like, is it leveled, or?
Uh, you can enter it, and you can, uh, if you wish to, you can find the sending zone and be able to send a message out.
So, um, it is, it is not completely leveled.
It's just very decimated.
Gotcha.
Okay.
Um, yeah, I think a little exploration is, uh, barited.
Okay.
Anyway.
Um, so go ahead and roll me some perception rolls, and we'll resolve that, and to Scott's point, it is 10 o'clock, so we'll go ahead and call it at that point.
But perception, yep, coming at you.
Oh, yeah.
Oh.
What is the benefit of the blind rolls, Jason?
You can't see when you roll fours and fives.
Right.
So, so Jason.
You also can't see when you finally roll a 20.
For the record, Jason, you did not roll a 20, but you did also, but you also did not roll a four or five.
You rolled somewhere in between there.
Oh, okay.
All right.
Okay.
No.
Good job.
It wasn't a one or a two.
It was not a one or a two.
Okay.
No.
So, Demlor, you, you know, you're piecing through the, through the pieces, and specifically you are able to pick up on some stuff here.
The, um, the magic that was being used against this doesn't appear to be any kind of, like, rune magic or anything.
It's something that's more, that's more in the lines of, like, your style of, your style of manipulating magic.
Um, so it's not, it's not specific to, like, there weren't, like, spells and spell effects that were hit here.
It's just pure, um, elemental energy that was used to, to destroy this, um, to destroy this watchtower.
Um, you're not able to, you're not able to find anything, um, anything specifically, um, actually.
Yeah, no, so, so that, that's kind of what you're able to figure out, um, from, from that perspective.
You, like, you're looking at this, and you're like, this is just as if there was just raw elemental energy that was being thrown around that was destroying this.
Um, you are definitely able to confirm that some of these footprints may be ogre footprints, but, um, but they don't look like, you know, like, it's kind of like, well, they could be ogre, but they don't really look like they're ogre footprints.
The, like, the ogres, um, are a lot more, like, human, like, they've got a lot more, like, human foot feet here.
Um, what you're seeing is more of, like, a clawed foot sort of situation.
Um, Rurik, uh, what you're able to discover is you find the, what's of the, um, of the captain's quarters, um, of Captain Iron.
Um, um, um, Iron Brow's quarters, quarters.
And, uh, you specifically look for the orders that they received, um, and you find something from the, um, by order of the Grand Regent, um, of Silvervain.
Um, they, they are, uh, of the clan, um, they are ordered to, um, stay, uh, to not perform scouting duties and to, um, have a, um, an internal lockdown until, um, until they are released.
Um, so that is, that is the main surprising order that you see.
Um, and if you remember, um, cause I know it's been a minute since we, since you were looking at, like, dwarf names, but.
Yeah, all Varric silver veins, the next one in line for the throne.
Yeah, that one, exactly.
Yeah, I was just working, I took notes of all the people in that room that I specifically noted that he was shifty.
Yeah.
He's proving himself to be even more shifty.
Um, all right.
And, uh, Hergan, as part of your, uh, as part of your investigations, um, the clawed footprints that, um, Rurik sends out, uh, points out to you, um, you recognize, um, kind of what, what those should be.
But they're kind of odd, um, they're not what would normally be of that, of that, um, um, of that monster type.
But, um, you're definitely picking up that there are multiple different, there are multiple trolls that are being, um, that, that appear to be the main onslaught on this.
And a footprint of something that is not an ogre, nor a troll, it's not something that you're at all familiar with, but it is, but that definitely, um, but you see some, like, you know, brown, gray hairs, um, of some sort of, like, matty coat that surround those specific footprints.
Um, and they are, um, and they are, again, kind of, like, larger, um, larger footprints than, than the troll footprints that you're, that you're seeing as well.
So, um, you're basically looking at, like, this watchtower was assaulted by trolls of some kind, um, and something else that's big and hairy.
All right.
All right.
Um, you guys are able to, like I said, you are able to find the sending stone, you are able to send a message back to, um, Captain, uh, Emberhelm.
Um, and, uh, he sends a message back to you, um, that, you know, um, thanks you for figuring out what's, what happened.
Um, he, uh, will send additional, um, he'll send additional, um, communications to the other watchtowers to let them know that one of the towers has fallen, um, and to double their efforts to be able to, um, secure a, uh, border here.
Um, and he urges you on to, uh, get to Ironhold to be able to plead your case to, uh, to the, to the king.
Um, as you head back, uh, to, as you head back to get to the main road, um, it does, it, you, you get to the end of the day.
Twilight turns into evening, evening turns into night, um, and about the time that you're about, you're about to get back to the overall, um, about the time that you're going to get back to that, um, that monument.
That you guys were looking at before the rings, um, um, you see a light in the distance, um, uh, towards where that monument is, um,
Um, and as, and, um, um, as you approach, as you approach, you're probably not, like, in, in the, in the section itself, but you see some sort of, like, um, light emanating from the monument, um, in, in the, in the night, um, which would bring you some elements of color.
And with that, um, with that, I am going to call it for tonight.
Stonehenge.
Aliens.
Rock and roll.
Rock and roll.
