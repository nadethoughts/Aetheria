WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.960
all right um when last we met you guys infiltrated the ogre war camp

00:12.960 --> 00:26.260
and uh were able to steal some war plans uh rurik was able to speed steal some more plans from

00:26.260 --> 00:40.600
the uh from the uh command tent uh you were able to save a dwarf that was being molded into into an

00:40.600 --> 00:53.800
elemental before he was um fully converted you killed an ogre and then and then took out

00:53.800 --> 01:06.520
um some ogre guards and freed 20 some or 20 dwarves from a cage returned back to um where

01:06.520 --> 01:20.760
um pale ironmark was um was hiding while he was waiting for you to return um in his wounded state

01:20.760 --> 01:31.440
and his first uh question when you all came with the refugees that you were able to save was where

01:31.440 --> 01:32.840
are all the rest

01:32.840 --> 01:45.760
now the wind bites as you crest the ridge um

01:45.760 --> 01:53.360
you are you're looking uh when when you start moving towards um

01:53.360 --> 02:02.280
towards safety uh the wind the wind bites as you crest the ridge the last rays of the sun

02:02.280 --> 02:10.720
bleeding across the jagged horizon behind you the ogre war camp burns its rituals disrupted

02:10.720 --> 02:20.880
and its prisoners freed 21 dwarves huddle close wounded weary and unready for the journey ahead

02:20.880 --> 02:28.960
hail ironmark glimpse beside you is voice low

02:28.960 --> 02:34.720
they'll come for us ogres don't forget and they don't forgive

02:34.720 --> 02:45.360
far below the mountains stretch like broken teeth somewhere out there lies safety um

02:46.400 --> 02:56.000
a fortified outpost a dwarven watchtower but between here and there the hunters have already been unleashed

02:56.000 --> 03:10.400
um your goal is to make it to the dwarven watchtower which is two days travel in forced march in enforced march

03:10.400 --> 03:23.040
um to get to a place where you can connect to other members of the dwarven clans and send information back

03:23.040 --> 03:29.520
um before you are recaptured by the ogre hunting parties

03:36.640 --> 03:40.480
in order to do this we're going to be performing a skill challenge

03:40.480 --> 03:46.240
um i have um five different skills that i'm going to need

03:46.240 --> 03:56.160
um that that that you can use in order to be able to attempt to um succeed in this skill challenge

03:56.160 --> 04:06.400
um a skill challenge is uh in in this way is we we are looking for you to make four successes

04:06.400 --> 04:13.680
before you have three failures each each failure will have a consequence

04:13.680 --> 04:22.000
and each success will get you closer to the dwarven uh watchtower

04:24.800 --> 04:33.520
um the five skills that you can use for this test are survival athletics stealth nature and perception

04:35.200 --> 04:43.520
um survival to navigate athletics to help the refugees over obstacles and carry the wounded

04:43.680 --> 04:53.040
um stealth to avoid detection by scouts and aerial hunters nature to predict weather and avoid natural hazards

04:53.040 --> 05:00.320
and perception to spot signs of pursuit and ambush signs of pursuit ambushes or traps

05:00.320 --> 05:13.760
now i i know i i know i just gave you kind of just a 500 mile or 500 uh foot overview um but

05:13.760 --> 05:22.160
um i will also want to give you guys opportunities to kind of choose how you're going to proceed because

05:22.160 --> 05:28.160
depending on what you decide and how you decide to do it that may affect which skills are used

05:28.160 --> 05:37.920
or it may involve bringing in other skills or other um or other tactics for you to be able to utilize

05:37.920 --> 05:46.160
uh for you to be able to utilize those in order to be able to get to the watchtower or if you want to

05:46.160 --> 05:51.440
skip the watchtower and just try and go straight for ironhole you can do that as well

05:51.440 --> 05:59.680
um the stain it will just modify the skill challenge slightly uh what do you think

06:03.520 --> 06:05.280
okay um

06:09.840 --> 06:12.800
and let me go ahead and change the picture

06:12.800 --> 06:20.720
i have a little piece called pick up the pace

06:22.880 --> 06:26.480
that i would to employ i think that could be helpful

06:29.680 --> 06:30.400
sounds helpful

06:32.400 --> 06:37.040
uh it can help others push themselves beyond their normal limits when hustling in a group during

06:37.040 --> 06:42.240
exploration mode your group can hustle for as long as the member who can hustle the longest

06:42.800 --> 06:50.000
on their phone so i might be completely useless but it sounds cool on paper yay

06:51.760 --> 07:01.760
um so i don't know anyway there's there's that guy um i think i also have predict weather oops

07:01.760 --> 07:09.920
sorry very good good very good um it sounds cool too but i don't know what it does yeah right

07:09.920 --> 07:21.040
um rock runner and mountain strategist are a couple other things that i have that help um

07:27.120 --> 07:35.520
okay so rock runner is like if somebody get like it allows you to move in precarious position in

07:35.520 --> 07:42.160
precarious situations um without without without having to make a um

07:44.080 --> 07:51.040
without having to reduce your speed um right i can ignore difficult terrain caused by stone

07:52.320 --> 08:00.560
um right if i use an acrobatic skill to do something then i get some you know balance or whatever then i get

08:00.560 --> 08:10.400
i get some bonuses right but um um pick up the pace means that if uh whoever it is who's doing the

08:10.400 --> 08:19.120
whoever it is who has the best athletics is the person it is the is the person that everybody can

08:19.920 --> 08:29.760
um that everybody can keep up with so like whoever has the best athletic score is it's not the least it's

08:29.760 --> 08:37.280
not the least among everybody it's the person who has the best one to help everybody keep keep going

08:38.320 --> 08:47.120
um which will get to the watchtower you said yeah there's a dwarven watchtower the closest

08:47.120 --> 08:55.280
the closest place where there's actually like dwarven army representatives um is a watchtower on the frontier this

08:55.280 --> 09:06.320
um dagger sheath was beyond the frontier it was a colony that was pushed beyond um where there's a heavy

09:06.320 --> 09:14.800
dwarven army presence the edge of the heavy dwarven army presence is that watchtower so that's what that's

09:14.800 --> 09:22.240
why you're shooting for that or at least that's what kale that's what kale iron mark is

09:23.360 --> 09:27.120
pushing for you guys to do you can choose to do something else if you don't

09:29.200 --> 09:38.000
but it's on the way to iron hold all right a little bit out of the way but it's but as far as like

09:38.000 --> 09:44.800
getting communication to iron hold it's the quickest method outside of using that outside of using that

09:46.560 --> 09:52.160
that magic item that you guys have that's connected to the spy master that you don't trust right

09:53.680 --> 10:06.800
yep yes yes i forgot i'll check

10:08.000 --> 10:21.600
um yeah i mean not having i guess we kind of have a map right but i think that it would be good to uh

10:22.640 --> 10:23.040
probably

10:28.480 --> 10:31.680
get somewhere where at least there can maybe be some reinforcements

10:31.680 --> 10:33.440
um

10:35.360 --> 10:40.160
yeah i'm good to go to the watchtower where we we drop off you know we can maybe drop off the 20 guys and

10:40.800 --> 10:41.120
and then

10:42.880 --> 10:45.280
hoof it from there

10:45.280 --> 10:54.080
at this point

10:54.080 --> 11:00.640
yeah i i'm not willing i'm not willing to send messages with anybody

11:02.720 --> 11:13.280
just because we have no clue outside of you know the three of us who we can trust

11:13.280 --> 11:17.840
yep yep yep that's fair

11:22.880 --> 11:25.520
these dwarves faces are pretty you know messy

11:28.160 --> 11:31.280
yeah well you know it must have been

11:32.400 --> 11:34.560
pretty bad a couple times in the face

11:34.560 --> 11:42.080
they were hanging out with a bunch of ogres what do you think they did that's my that's my point

11:43.440 --> 11:44.880
they were abused

11:49.840 --> 11:50.240
anyway

11:54.080 --> 11:58.640
um yeah so you know i think that's the the direction the course the course to take

11:59.200 --> 12:02.400
i'm assuming it's a little closer to go there than it is just straight to them

12:02.400 --> 12:16.960
yeah no it it definitely is um it's two days forced march with um to the watchtower it took you two

12:16.960 --> 12:23.200
weeks on goats to make it to where you are right now so it's significantly closer

12:23.200 --> 12:34.480
uh all right um based on what we know and understand and blah blah blah blah

12:37.200 --> 12:37.440
how

12:39.280 --> 12:43.200
how fast are these ogres going to be able to move to catch up to us

12:45.360 --> 12:46.800
are we expecting that within

12:46.800 --> 12:51.040
um a day they could be you know caught up and

12:55.680 --> 13:00.160
well they're significantly larger than you um which means they don't have to

13:00.800 --> 13:08.080
which means they can travel longer distances without being as fatigued um they are

13:09.040 --> 13:18.320
also not carrying 20 20 to 21 um wounded dwarves that have been malnourished and abused

13:19.040 --> 13:30.720
um with them so you probably could assume that the ogres uh can be on top of you

13:30.720 --> 13:43.360
very quickly if you don't um if you're not like you know moving if you're not booking it um which is

13:43.360 --> 13:55.440
why like it's it's it's twilight right now and um kale wants kale is pushing heavily that you guys continue

13:55.440 --> 14:02.400
on um and don't stop for the night

14:03.520 --> 14:07.520
kale is the guy who was trapped in the thing that we found yeah right

14:09.680 --> 14:13.520
yeah he was the he was the captain of the guard of dagger sheath

14:19.600 --> 14:23.360
okay i mean as far as i'm concerned i i can't see a reason why we wouldn't

14:25.440 --> 14:32.080
go ahead with that yep yeah i tend to agree and we can't do that probably the entire time we'll

14:32.080 --> 14:38.560
have to stop and rest at some point i imagine especially the condition they're in but we can

14:38.560 --> 14:46.160
go tonight and we might be able to find a at the least fortifiable position uh put us put us in a

14:46.160 --> 14:49.440
spot where it would be harder for them to surround us

14:52.320 --> 14:53.600
something of that nature

14:56.080 --> 14:56.480
all right

14:59.040 --> 15:04.480
so um who's going to make the first roll

15:07.120 --> 15:08.240
and what are you rolling

15:12.400 --> 15:20.640
so i just want to be utilizing an athletics check for endurance keep us going or

15:20.640 --> 15:31.120
no one's like a decent idea

15:31.120 --> 15:36.720
so who has the best athletics

15:36.720 --> 15:38.720
so who has the best athletics

15:40.720 --> 15:41.440
not it

15:43.280 --> 15:47.520
10 plus 10. that's pretty good what did you say scott

15:47.520 --> 15:52.160
that's 10 yeah you're better than me

15:56.880 --> 15:57.680
only back to you

15:59.120 --> 16:00.160
roll athletics

16:00.160 --> 16:02.720
that too makes a big difference

16:02.720 --> 16:08.320
yeah especially when you roll like i roll

16:08.320 --> 16:10.320
this is how

16:10.320 --> 16:11.760
all right

16:11.760 --> 16:13.760
all right

16:13.760 --> 16:14.560
right

16:14.560 --> 16:17.360
i don't know about that

16:17.360 --> 16:19.040
that does seem pretty good

16:19.040 --> 16:21.840
nope that does

16:23.840 --> 16:28.800
all right well you guys you uh you push into the night um

16:28.800 --> 16:37.840
there are a few times where there are some of the uh some of the dwarven survivors that start lagging behind but

16:37.840 --> 16:40.480
um

16:40.480 --> 16:42.480
um

16:42.480 --> 16:43.440
um

16:43.440 --> 16:44.320
encouragement

16:44.320 --> 16:50.160
um allows them to keep up with hergin as he starts booking through the uh

16:50.880 --> 16:54.720
through the mountains um combine that with dem lore's uh

16:55.760 --> 17:01.680
rock running uh leading the way when when going through rocks and different things

17:01.680 --> 17:02.640
um

17:02.640 --> 17:08.320
and you are indeed able to make it through the night um

17:09.040 --> 17:12.720
without uh without any um

17:15.200 --> 17:18.720
without any uh concern um well

17:19.440 --> 17:24.560
a little concern uh you do hear in the um

17:26.400 --> 17:31.120
in the in the dusk um a few times

17:32.080 --> 17:34.080
the um

17:34.080 --> 17:39.200
how the monstrous uh monstrously loud howls

17:40.000 --> 17:41.920
um in the in the background

17:43.440 --> 17:44.480
um to which

17:46.160 --> 17:46.560
kale

17:52.800 --> 17:53.680
um

17:53.680 --> 17:56.640
kale shudders every time that happens

17:58.720 --> 17:58.960
and

17:58.960 --> 18:01.360
um

18:01.360 --> 18:01.600
um

18:01.600 --> 18:02.880
and he

18:02.880 --> 18:05.440
leans over to hergin

18:05.440 --> 18:06.720
and says

18:08.720 --> 18:10.240
that's gorvok's beasts

18:11.840 --> 18:13.360
they hunt for sport

18:13.360 --> 18:13.920
um

18:13.920 --> 18:14.400
they

18:14.400 --> 18:16.160
they don't

18:16.160 --> 18:16.400
uh

18:17.600 --> 18:18.720
those are

18:18.720 --> 18:20.160
gorvok's beasts

18:21.520 --> 18:22.240
a hunter

18:23.280 --> 18:24.560
never stops hunting

18:26.240 --> 18:26.800
um

18:29.360 --> 18:33.200
and he seems to limp a little bit faster whenever he hears it

18:39.600 --> 18:42.880
you have successfully passed the evening

18:43.840 --> 18:44.400
um

18:44.400 --> 18:48.000
and you are into the morning

18:48.000 --> 18:49.200
now what are you going to do

18:53.040 --> 18:53.200
um

18:53.920 --> 18:55.200
i can see either

18:55.760 --> 18:55.920
uh

18:56.560 --> 18:59.520
trying to make a survival to get like the right path

18:59.520 --> 19:01.040
or

19:02.000 --> 19:02.640
stealth

19:02.640 --> 19:05.840
to make sure we stay hidden and cover our tracks

19:05.840 --> 19:10.000
either either one seems like the most sensible to me at this point

19:13.120 --> 19:17.120
yeah i was thinking my scout dedication would help find us the right path but

19:19.200 --> 19:19.760
i like it

19:26.400 --> 19:27.360
i can dig that

19:27.360 --> 19:30.000
all right

19:30.000 --> 19:31.520
all right um

19:31.520 --> 19:32.800
sounds like a

19:34.560 --> 19:35.680
perception rule

19:38.240 --> 19:40.720
so what is that scout dedication

19:40.720 --> 19:41.680
it could be survival

19:44.480 --> 19:45.600
scout dedication

19:52.000 --> 19:55.280
i'm pretty sure the scout dedication

19:57.360 --> 19:58.160
um

20:02.160 --> 20:06.160
perform scout exploration activity at the same time as avoid notice

20:07.440 --> 20:08.640
exploration activity

20:09.760 --> 20:13.280
bonus to your initiative is plus two instead of plus one

20:14.480 --> 20:14.720
so

20:16.000 --> 20:16.320
um

20:18.480 --> 20:23.920
okay so if you're using your scout dedication then it would be a stealth role

20:24.560 --> 20:25.520
based off of this

20:26.560 --> 20:30.240
so you're basically just scouting ahead you're keeping an eye out but you're also

20:31.120 --> 20:33.840
um keeping yourself um as

20:36.000 --> 20:37.760
um

20:37.760 --> 20:37.920
concealed as possible

20:37.920 --> 20:39.280
concealed as possible yeah

20:40.320 --> 20:42.400
so do i have to put any modifiers

20:43.120 --> 20:44.480
plus anything

20:45.600 --> 20:45.760
no

20:45.760 --> 20:53.840
the the plus two to your initiative is if you actually do go into combat

20:54.960 --> 20:55.440
right

20:55.440 --> 21:03.680
so um so the sun so the sun crests the hills you guys are still trudging along on the rocky terrain

21:04.400 --> 21:04.880
um

21:06.000 --> 21:09.200
now that the now that it's daylight you don't feel

21:09.840 --> 21:15.520
as uh you feel more exposed especially with those howls that have been happening overnight

21:16.160 --> 21:19.360
um so you start looking for um

21:21.120 --> 21:26.640
shadowed areas and crags for you to be able to hide as you are as you're traveling

21:31.440 --> 21:33.440
what was that

21:33.680 --> 21:35.440
uh

21:35.440 --> 21:36.400
that was a 12

21:38.160 --> 21:43.600
as you as you travel through a uh as you travel through a ravine

21:44.720 --> 21:48.800
um just like trying trying to lose

21:48.800 --> 21:49.520
um

21:55.440 --> 21:58.800
trying to lose trying to lose any pursuit

21:58.800 --> 22:03.680
um

22:06.240 --> 22:09.600
you hear you do hear um

22:11.440 --> 22:18.320
that you hear the howls that you had heard in the distance but they are a lot closer you start you

22:18.320 --> 22:26.400
start moving quicker um pushing the uh pushing the captives to to the front and having them run ahead as

22:26.400 --> 22:29.360
as you try and cover it cover as a rear guard

22:30.080 --> 22:32.160
um and when you

22:32.160 --> 22:39.120
uh and as you're running through the ravine you keep you keep on looking up on the different

22:39.120 --> 22:43.120
uh sides of of the ravine and you see

22:43.120 --> 22:44.320
um

22:44.320 --> 22:46.080
um

22:46.080 --> 22:48.240
you see three wolves

22:48.240 --> 22:52.960
three large wolves

22:53.920 --> 22:54.320
um

22:55.600 --> 22:58.160
that are sniffing around the uh

22:59.120 --> 23:01.040
sniffing around the top of the ravine

23:01.040 --> 23:02.800
um

23:02.800 --> 23:07.360
with glowing

23:08.480 --> 23:09.600
ghostly eyes

23:10.320 --> 23:11.200
these wolves are

23:12.480 --> 23:14.800
easily the size of a

23:14.800 --> 23:15.600
um

23:15.600 --> 23:15.680
um

23:15.680 --> 23:20.160
the size of a uh

23:20.160 --> 23:20.240
uh

23:20.240 --> 23:21.120
um

23:21.120 --> 23:30.640
with it what would the size of a dire wolf be it would be like the size of a large lion

23:32.000 --> 23:32.240
um

23:32.240 --> 23:44.320
and up and they they howl um in in a way that is in a in a call

23:45.200 --> 23:47.760
and as they uh as they do you see

23:48.720 --> 23:50.320
a bipedal creature

23:51.760 --> 23:52.160
uh

23:53.440 --> 23:54.640
with its uh

23:56.640 --> 24:00.800
stick its head across out of the out of the edge of the ravine

24:01.920 --> 24:04.160
and you see a

24:06.080 --> 24:07.600
giant wolf

24:08.400 --> 24:08.720
um

24:09.520 --> 24:10.880
on its hind legs

24:11.840 --> 24:12.640
that is

24:13.520 --> 24:15.680
the size of an ogre

24:17.040 --> 24:19.200
and as you look at this wolf

24:20.480 --> 24:20.800
um

24:21.840 --> 24:24.640
it lets loose another howl

24:25.600 --> 24:25.920
and

24:29.840 --> 24:30.080
um

24:32.480 --> 24:34.560
i'd like to re-roll using a hair point

24:34.560 --> 24:39.520
you want to snipe that thing

24:44.080 --> 24:45.120
oh brother

24:45.120 --> 24:45.680
uh

24:45.680 --> 24:46.080
that's

24:46.080 --> 24:46.640
yep

24:49.360 --> 24:51.040
and as it howls

24:52.240 --> 24:52.560
um

24:56.560 --> 24:57.040
it's

24:58.320 --> 24:59.600
grows larger

25:01.520 --> 25:01.600
that's

25:01.600 --> 25:02.320
we need that

25:04.320 --> 25:04.640
yeah

25:04.640 --> 25:05.200
excellent

25:05.200 --> 25:06.240
it's exciting

25:06.240 --> 25:11.760
i don't like the names of any of the things on the screen at the moment

25:13.440 --> 25:14.000
no

25:14.000 --> 25:14.800
there's graphic

25:15.520 --> 25:16.480
ember hand

25:17.600 --> 25:18.880
when you need a fighter

25:18.880 --> 25:21.680
aww

25:21.680 --> 25:22.960
we got plenty of fighter

25:24.080 --> 25:24.640
that's right

25:26.240 --> 25:27.440
it's just a ranger

25:27.440 --> 25:28.080
and uh

25:32.080 --> 25:32.480
uh

25:33.280 --> 25:34.400
elementalist

25:34.400 --> 25:35.120
is that what they're called

25:35.120 --> 25:35.760
kineticist

25:35.760 --> 25:37.760
that's been involved in this system

25:38.960 --> 25:39.200
yeah

25:40.160 --> 25:40.560
all right

25:40.560 --> 25:40.880
well

25:40.880 --> 25:41.600
all right

25:41.600 --> 25:41.840
they

25:41.840 --> 25:42.640
the

25:42.640 --> 25:44.000
they uh

25:44.000 --> 25:44.800
they all

25:44.800 --> 25:45.600
um

25:45.600 --> 25:46.880
look to be

25:46.880 --> 25:47.680
um

25:47.680 --> 25:48.880
ready to pounce

25:48.880 --> 25:49.840
um

25:51.120 --> 25:51.520
and

25:51.520 --> 25:52.400
some of them are

25:53.280 --> 25:55.920
some of them are looking ahead to the dwarves that are

25:57.200 --> 25:59.200
in this battle map to the south

26:01.840 --> 26:02.560
um

26:02.560 --> 26:03.040
south

26:03.040 --> 26:04.640
south

26:04.640 --> 26:04.720
south

26:04.720 --> 26:06.720
yeah you're going from north to south here

26:07.440 --> 26:08.480
oh they're

26:08.480 --> 26:09.360
the dwarves are

26:09.920 --> 26:11.040
down here beyond

26:11.520 --> 26:12.400
beyond the map

26:12.400 --> 26:13.600
like you pushed them ahead

26:14.640 --> 26:14.880
um

26:19.040 --> 26:20.560
not off the cliff but

26:20.560 --> 26:21.280
oh okay

26:26.240 --> 26:26.320
um

26:26.320 --> 26:27.040
um

26:27.040 --> 26:27.520
we'll

26:27.520 --> 26:30.400
we'll say that they traveled north instead

26:30.400 --> 26:32.560
i forgot that there was a cliff at the end there

26:33.040 --> 26:33.280
but

26:33.280 --> 26:34.160
um

26:34.160 --> 26:34.720
so they're

26:34.720 --> 26:35.120
they're

26:35.120 --> 26:36.960
you're traveling from south to north

26:38.320 --> 26:38.560
um

26:41.440 --> 26:41.920
and

26:45.920 --> 26:46.480
um

26:46.480 --> 26:47.040
the wind

26:47.040 --> 26:47.600
yeah

26:47.600 --> 26:49.360
and the winds shift

26:49.360 --> 26:50.080
and with it

26:50.080 --> 26:50.400
a

26:50.400 --> 26:51.440
the scent of blood

26:51.440 --> 26:52.640
a guttural howl

26:52.640 --> 26:54.000
splits the dust

26:54.000 --> 26:54.800
uh

26:54.800 --> 26:55.200
split

26:55.200 --> 26:55.920
splits

26:55.920 --> 26:57.040
the air

26:57.040 --> 26:57.840
from a

26:57.840 --> 26:59.040
from the tree line

26:59.040 --> 27:01.040
an ogre shaped figure

27:01.040 --> 27:02.160
lopes forward

27:02.160 --> 27:04.640
its body twisted by lycanthropy

27:04.640 --> 27:05.520
around him

27:05.520 --> 27:06.400
wolves

27:06.400 --> 27:07.120
snarl

27:07.120 --> 27:08.160
and circle

27:08.160 --> 27:09.760
um

27:09.760 --> 27:12.080
let's go ahead and roll some initiatives

27:12.080 --> 27:12.880
shall we

27:12.880 --> 27:15.440
shot of silver bullets

27:15.440 --> 27:17.920
right

27:17.920 --> 27:20.560
all right

27:20.560 --> 27:21.280
um

27:21.280 --> 27:23.600
since we were trying to be stealthy

27:23.600 --> 27:26.000
is it kosher to roll stealth for this initiative

27:26.000 --> 27:26.560
well

27:26.560 --> 27:29.360
it is kosher to roll stealth on this initiative

27:29.360 --> 27:33.440
and you guys also get a plus two tier initiative

27:33.440 --> 27:33.840
oh

27:33.840 --> 27:34.400
because

27:34.400 --> 27:35.680
of

27:35.680 --> 27:36.320
the

27:36.320 --> 27:37.440
um

27:37.440 --> 27:37.920
scouting

27:37.920 --> 27:39.200
stuff

27:39.200 --> 27:40.000
plus two

27:40.000 --> 27:42.720
love it

27:42.720 --> 27:44.160
i didn't put any of that

27:44.160 --> 27:45.360
can you just adjust it

27:45.360 --> 27:46.880
yeah i will

27:46.880 --> 27:47.840
all right

27:47.840 --> 27:51.680
i don't want to re-roll that man

27:51.680 --> 27:53.520
oh

27:53.520 --> 27:54.080
no

27:54.080 --> 27:56.240
nobody wants to re-roll that

27:56.240 --> 27:58.160
six

27:58.160 --> 28:00.160
yeah

28:00.160 --> 28:00.960
yeah

28:00.960 --> 28:03.200
i'm

28:03.200 --> 28:04.320
i'm stealthy

28:04.320 --> 28:06.720
you are stealthy

28:06.720 --> 28:10.640
okay

28:10.640 --> 28:14.080
um

28:14.080 --> 28:21.520
i'm not excited about a werewolf order

28:21.520 --> 28:23.440
this sounds really

28:23.440 --> 28:24.560
sucky

28:26.240 --> 28:26.960
uh yeah

28:26.960 --> 28:28.880
i thought it sounded pretty awesome

28:28.880 --> 28:30.640
werewolf ogre

28:30.640 --> 28:31.600
that's why i mean

28:31.600 --> 28:32.080
it's pretty awesome

28:32.080 --> 28:33.280
if i was one

28:33.280 --> 28:34.560
it'd probably be pretty awesome

28:34.560 --> 28:36.320
but to fight one

28:36.320 --> 28:38.400
just if you're that large

28:38.400 --> 28:39.040
right

28:39.040 --> 28:41.520
sucker takes up the whole screen

28:41.520 --> 28:44.640
he is a very big boy

28:44.640 --> 28:47.920
started off as an ogre and then when

28:47.920 --> 28:49.360
and then when uh

28:49.360 --> 28:51.440
when lycanthropes uh

28:51.440 --> 28:54.560
go into their hybrid form they

28:54.560 --> 28:57.040
increase the size category

28:57.040 --> 28:58.160
so he's

28:58.160 --> 28:58.480
more

28:58.480 --> 29:00.960
large

29:00.960 --> 29:02.480
very large

29:04.000 --> 29:04.160
um

29:04.160 --> 29:05.920
i count him as

29:05.920 --> 29:07.280
i believe the correct term

29:07.280 --> 29:08.560
is huge

29:09.440 --> 29:11.840
i count him as a giant so that i can have some

29:11.840 --> 29:13.120
you know bonuses to my

29:13.120 --> 29:15.440
he does

29:15.440 --> 29:17.520
he does actually count as a giant

29:17.520 --> 29:19.120
because he is an owner

29:19.120 --> 29:20.560
so don't

29:20.560 --> 29:21.840
you do get your giant

29:22.320 --> 29:22.800
bonuses

29:22.800 --> 29:28.720
all right to start us off we have

29:28.720 --> 29:29.520
ruric

29:29.520 --> 29:32.720

29:41.520 --> 29:43.040
on a ridge

29:43.040 --> 29:43.840

29:43.840 --> 29:46.160
line of sight to it from here

29:46.160 --> 29:50.320

33:41.440 --> 33:44.960
all right so here's what i'm going to do i am going to

33:45.520 --> 33:46.160
move

33:47.680 --> 33:48.400
over here

33:49.760 --> 33:52.080
like get under this here cliff edge

33:52.960 --> 33:56.160
and i am going to hide slash reload

33:57.120 --> 34:01.440
obviously i'm not hiding from these two up on this cliff because they can clearly see me

34:01.440 --> 34:04.960
but i imagine now that the two above can no longer see me

34:05.840 --> 34:06.080
yes

34:07.280 --> 34:11.280
so i'm going to move there and attempt to hide

34:11.280 --> 34:12.960
uh

34:12.960 --> 34:13.520
uh

34:13.520 --> 34:18.400
which i do by pushing the hide button which is right there and

34:19.440 --> 34:24.240
that is appropriate and that also lets me reload for free so i am loaded

34:24.800 --> 34:25.360
that's me

34:27.680 --> 34:28.080
all right

34:30.720 --> 34:31.200
emlar

34:34.000 --> 34:34.320
um

34:34.320 --> 34:35.360
so much

34:35.360 --> 34:36.400
so much

34:36.400 --> 34:38.880
no

34:38.880 --> 34:38.960
no

34:42.960 --> 34:45.680
so much going on

34:47.360 --> 34:47.760
here

34:47.760 --> 34:51.200
uh

34:51.200 --> 34:52.320
um

34:52.320 --> 34:52.800
um

34:52.800 --> 35:02.160
oh and uh rurik you shot and you shot him right in the face and you see a portion of his snout or a portion of

35:02.800 --> 35:04.320
his face just kind of get

35:06.080 --> 35:13.680
mangled and bloody and he looks down at you and at the rest of the group and he looks even

35:14.480 --> 35:14.880
um

35:14.880 --> 35:14.960
um

35:14.960 --> 35:16.480
he looks even more

35:16.480 --> 35:17.520
um

35:19.360 --> 35:20.000
determined

35:20.000 --> 35:21.360
slash terrifying

35:22.880 --> 35:23.360
excellent

35:24.240 --> 35:25.040
did he get bigger

35:25.040 --> 35:25.360
all right

35:26.320 --> 35:27.600
he did not get bigger

35:27.600 --> 35:29.360
he just he stayed at huge

35:30.160 --> 35:31.120
mm-hmm

35:31.120 --> 35:32.560
you don't need to get any bigger

35:35.920 --> 35:36.320
um

35:37.600 --> 35:38.160
i am

35:41.600 --> 35:42.960
yeah it was just

35:43.680 --> 35:48.160
i'm sitting here thinking that this is

35:48.160 --> 35:51.440
disadvantageous enough that i don't know that i really want to take a

35:52.480 --> 35:54.240
turn right this second

35:55.760 --> 35:56.000
um

35:57.440 --> 35:59.440
pull yourself out of the initiative order

36:00.080 --> 36:04.800
yeah and maybe see what you know if they're gonna try to jump down here then

36:05.680 --> 36:06.240
you know maybe

36:08.000 --> 36:11.680
maybe i can reinsert myself i'm so here's kind of what i'm thinking

36:12.320 --> 36:12.960
um

36:12.960 --> 36:17.120
i'm thinking that if one of these you know decides to like take a leap

36:18.560 --> 36:22.240
that while they're kind of mid-air i'm just going to

36:23.440 --> 36:26.080
generate a nice pike

36:26.880 --> 36:29.600
hole right about where they're gonna land

36:29.600 --> 36:32.640
does that make sense

36:36.640 --> 36:37.200
yeah

36:37.200 --> 36:37.840
um

36:37.840 --> 36:40.240
well you won't be able to insert yourself

36:41.120 --> 36:42.240
yeah like mid

36:42.240 --> 36:44.000
in initiative to do that

36:44.800 --> 36:45.760
it you could

36:46.560 --> 36:46.880
um

36:47.520 --> 36:53.520
so you can like reserve an action which would cost you two actions

36:53.520 --> 36:54.160
okay

36:54.160 --> 36:54.800
to

36:54.800 --> 36:57.120
do an interrupt

36:58.160 --> 37:02.400
it cost you two actions and your reaction in order to be able to do that

37:03.280 --> 37:03.600
but

37:03.600 --> 37:04.480
um

37:06.960 --> 37:08.800
but that is something that you could do

37:09.840 --> 37:10.000
um

37:10.000 --> 37:16.000
i i'm sorry i missed kind of what the what the thing was you were going to do on where it landed

37:16.000 --> 37:17.280
but um

37:17.280 --> 37:22.160
you're right just like try to create like form a a steel pike

37:23.040 --> 37:27.760
where where it's coming down like if it leaps like here's a a steel pike that just

37:28.400 --> 37:30.080
sprouts up out of the ground

37:30.880 --> 37:32.320
or that's where it's going to land

37:32.320 --> 37:37.600
so that it it lands on this thing and impales itself

37:39.600 --> 37:43.120
yeah no that that makes sense um so from a from a

37:44.560 --> 37:47.680
um from a game mechanics perspective

37:48.640 --> 37:52.640
um you would just be doing a ranged elemental blast

37:53.440 --> 37:59.600
as an interrupt action for um when when the first wolf jumps down

37:59.600 --> 38:00.320
okay

38:01.360 --> 38:01.600
um

38:02.480 --> 38:07.120
and in order to be able to do that like i said it will cost you two actions and reaction

38:07.120 --> 38:08.640
in order to be able to do that

38:09.440 --> 38:09.680
um

38:10.800 --> 38:15.360
and it and you can only do a one action elemental blast at that point okay

38:15.760 --> 38:16.000
um

38:18.960 --> 38:19.200
so

38:21.280 --> 38:21.600
um

38:24.400 --> 38:28.880
trying to think if there's a maybe just hit him yeah it sounds like that's the better

38:29.600 --> 38:30.800
um

38:30.800 --> 38:31.120
um

38:31.920 --> 38:37.280
yeah it's kind of it's it's like i love your i like i mean we could totally

38:38.480 --> 38:38.800
um

38:39.440 --> 38:40.640
vision of it is great

38:43.040 --> 38:45.280
yeah we could totally flavor it to be that

38:45.280 --> 38:45.840
um

38:48.000 --> 38:53.840
like i i don't have a problem with that like i'm just trying to figure out from like a mechanics perspective

38:53.840 --> 38:54.560
it's not really

38:55.440 --> 39:01.920
designed to have something that cool and cinematic just happen but um

39:04.560 --> 39:10.800
like i i would say you could just do a two-action elemental blast right now and we could just flavor

39:10.800 --> 39:15.520
it as that's that's that's what happens when the when the uh

39:17.680 --> 39:18.880
when the uh

39:20.640 --> 39:22.320
wolf jumps down there yeah

39:22.960 --> 39:28.960
so it's it's either that or i use the magnetic pinions and i just try to like target all three

39:28.960 --> 39:32.160
creatures within 60 feet of me um

39:32.160 --> 39:41.440
it's also not bad yeah um although you would have to you would have to channel elements again after

39:41.440 --> 39:48.720
you use the magnetic pinions oh but that's not bad like you can and that's an action magnet

39:48.720 --> 39:52.560
pinions yeah that's one that closes the whole thing down

39:54.320 --> 39:57.360
it closes the gate yeah so you have to reopen the gate

39:57.360 --> 40:03.680
which is an action but on the following turn which is one action yeah right um

40:04.560 --> 40:08.400
so not not terrible though like that's not a bad idea either

40:12.880 --> 40:18.960
all right so i'm good with like the shard strike the two action shard strike i think is what you're

40:18.960 --> 40:34.400
talking about with uh um just trying to make it look you know like that's what happens um yeah so i will

40:36.160 --> 40:37.120
i will target

40:40.080 --> 40:41.040
this guy here

40:41.040 --> 40:56.320
and then i will see about doing an attack um the blast is the one i need to do

41:02.640 --> 41:08.240
uh you can just do a blast or you can do the shard strike um

41:11.040 --> 41:20.880
although shard strike looks like it's um that's a template one like a template attack

41:21.760 --> 41:29.840
so like a 30 foot line or yeah yeah yeah which is or you could just do an elemental blast which is

41:30.400 --> 41:31.360
within 30 feet

41:31.360 --> 41:44.800
and that guy's 35 feet so um you would have to move i do need to move closer

41:46.080 --> 41:50.000
yeah yeah and i'll i can do that easy enough um

41:52.000 --> 41:52.480
i will

41:54.720 --> 41:56.160
reposition myself

41:56.160 --> 42:01.440
really climbing you know if i'm doing a little bit of climbing here

42:03.440 --> 42:10.400
yeah you you got that rock i got all your stuff going on so it's not going to affect me at all

42:12.560 --> 42:15.200
um so i'll position myself there and then

42:17.680 --> 42:24.640
um okay i got the two action elemental blast activated

42:24.640 --> 42:31.360
um do i do i do the electric one does that change things

42:33.600 --> 42:39.520
uh it's just damage type is different okay so if you think they'll be you if you think they'll be

42:39.520 --> 42:46.880
more susceptible to electric damage over piercing or slashing then do that but i'm gonna go with

42:46.880 --> 42:53.680
piercing as far as like doing more damage no i don't think it does okay and then i just click on

42:53.680 --> 42:55.520
the blast plus 11 and we go right

42:57.600 --> 43:04.480
right it does go okay i don't think there's anything i need to adjust so um

43:06.400 --> 43:11.760
yeah these guys aren't giants so there's no circumstance bonuses there so we just go ahead and roll

43:13.440 --> 43:16.000
oh look at i rolled a six isn't that surprising

43:16.000 --> 43:22.560
which is indeed a miss

43:24.240 --> 43:27.360
it was almost at a 16 and then bounced to six

43:30.080 --> 43:33.040
yep rigged okay

43:35.760 --> 43:37.520
that's my turn right that's everything so

43:39.920 --> 43:41.440
moved and yeah yeah

43:43.280 --> 43:43.920
all right man

43:43.920 --> 43:56.240
this warg jumps down here

44:00.880 --> 44:01.280
oh no

44:03.760 --> 44:05.360
i am not that tasty i promise

44:06.720 --> 44:08.480
you just blew the heck out of his

44:09.360 --> 44:11.600
master that's this button the whole world

44:11.600 --> 44:13.520
world that doesn't mean i'm tasty

44:15.520 --> 44:16.560
very dry and stringy

44:23.840 --> 44:33.520
all right

44:42.320 --> 44:43.840
oh he's just going to attack

44:45.520 --> 44:46.080
run down

44:52.720 --> 44:53.440
strike

44:58.960 --> 45:00.800
oh get wrecked

45:00.800 --> 45:07.920
well that's much closer than i want seeing as how you rolled a three

45:07.920 --> 45:09.920
right

45:09.920 --> 45:14.320
and he's going to make a

45:15.520 --> 45:16.720
and make a second attack

45:17.440 --> 45:18.560
yeah bring it

45:18.560 --> 45:24.240
can they move like 50 feet at a turn

45:25.920 --> 45:26.880
oh that'll probably hit

45:27.520 --> 45:28.480
yeah yeah yeah

45:29.840 --> 45:31.840
uh yes they can

45:32.800 --> 45:33.680
relatively close

45:36.560 --> 45:37.440
um

45:48.560 --> 45:50.400
he grabs

45:55.120 --> 45:55.440
that

45:57.120 --> 45:57.440
hmm

45:58.640 --> 45:59.360
interesting

46:02.160 --> 46:03.600
and a uh

46:03.600 --> 46:06.000
and frost forms around its uh

46:07.680 --> 46:10.960
around its bite giving you frostbite

46:11.840 --> 46:14.560
all right

46:18.560 --> 46:23.120
cool cool cool cool

46:26.240 --> 46:28.960
okay um and he

46:30.880 --> 46:31.440
and

46:40.960 --> 46:41.440
um

46:48.560 --> 46:49.760
okay uh

46:49.760 --> 46:51.280
that's the end of his turn

46:51.280 --> 46:52.480
so he jumps down

46:52.480 --> 46:53.360
and starts

46:54.000 --> 46:56.160
starts mowing on ruric

46:57.440 --> 46:57.760
ow

46:59.600 --> 47:00.640
hurrican you're up

47:03.040 --> 47:06.160
is it stupid for me to pull out

47:07.040 --> 47:09.840
and wait for someone of the white ones to attack me

47:10.800 --> 47:12.160
so that i can actually hit him

47:12.160 --> 47:16.000
because like right now i can't hit to either of them

47:16.560 --> 47:16.800
you know

47:18.000 --> 47:20.880
yeah but you can get to the one that's down in the ravine

47:21.200 --> 47:24.640
and if you do move to a flanking position you're going to get

47:25.280 --> 47:26.800
a bonus so

47:28.080 --> 47:32.800
it's not stupid to pull yourself out of initiative but you can all you also do have a good

47:33.520 --> 47:35.200
a good target right there

47:36.000 --> 47:36.480
that's true

47:37.520 --> 47:37.840
yeah

47:38.480 --> 47:42.000
so i have to hunt prey though first and then i move so i get one

47:42.000 --> 47:42.640
shot right

47:44.320 --> 47:46.480
yeah but your twin takedown is a

47:48.320 --> 47:50.800
yeah it's still one like two hits and one

47:52.400 --> 47:57.520
yeah i think yeah it's a it's one um

47:59.680 --> 48:03.120
i think it's a one action thing so you can hunt prey

48:05.280 --> 48:07.920
move and twin take down and get two shots

48:09.280 --> 48:10.320
can i go here

48:12.000 --> 48:13.680
and be blanking

48:14.880 --> 48:15.120
yep

48:18.640 --> 48:23.760
okay i think i'm already hunting prey let's check it's got the big eye thing so it should be

48:23.760 --> 48:27.280
uh

48:27.280 --> 48:31.440
uh yes but there are also um bonuses

48:36.560 --> 48:38.400
for the prey that's being hunted

48:38.400 --> 48:43.520
you

48:47.360 --> 48:48.640
i

48:48.640 --> 48:50.960
drop that on okay we good

48:51.920 --> 48:52.960
thank you

48:52.960 --> 48:53.360
well

48:53.360 --> 48:58.800
okay

48:59.040 --> 48:59.280
okay

48:59.280 --> 49:09.520
Does it matter which one I have as my second attack

49:09.520 --> 49:11.540
and first attack? I'm sorry, I'm just totally

49:11.540 --> 49:11.940
forgetting.

49:13.040 --> 49:15.440
No, you just need to make sure

49:15.440 --> 49:17.400
that one is one weapon and the other is

49:17.400 --> 49:18.000
the other weapon.

49:18.880 --> 49:19.320
Okay.

49:24.040 --> 49:25.180
Oh, it was a 20

49:25.180 --> 49:27.080
and then rolled over.

49:27.960 --> 49:28.380
Okay.

49:29.280 --> 49:31.360
I would like to re-roll using

49:31.360 --> 49:32.560
a hero point

49:32.560 --> 49:35.500
just because I don't want

49:35.500 --> 49:36.520
to miss both.

49:43.220 --> 49:44.800
Or should I not do that?

49:49.800 --> 49:51.320
Oh, to

49:51.320 --> 49:52.640
use your hero point?

49:53.340 --> 49:54.320
That was perfectly fine.

49:54.320 --> 50:00.060
How do I re-roll both?

50:02.400 --> 50:04.380
I'm not sure that you can re-roll

50:04.380 --> 50:06.280
both. I think you could only

50:06.280 --> 50:07.460
re-roll one.

50:07.460 --> 50:08.460
Um...

50:08.460 --> 50:11.740
Okay, then I don't...

50:11.740 --> 50:15.340
Oh, D2 then.

50:16.600 --> 50:16.920
Okay.

50:19.680 --> 50:21.840
Well, we started off so strong

50:21.840 --> 50:24.380
we had two misses.

50:24.580 --> 50:25.020
What's up?

50:26.460 --> 50:27.680
It was a 20

50:27.680 --> 50:28.860
and then it rolled over

50:28.860 --> 50:31.040
as dice are loaded.

50:31.040 --> 50:40.160
So...

50:42.000 --> 50:42.360
All right.

50:42.840 --> 50:43.780
This guy

50:43.780 --> 50:46.160
is going to...

50:46.960 --> 50:58.780
going to use

50:58.780 --> 51:00.280
his winter breath.

51:01.160 --> 51:02.480
I don't like that.

51:06.260 --> 51:07.780
He...

51:07.780 --> 51:16.780
He has a...

51:18.240 --> 51:19.720
Let's see here.

51:21.720 --> 51:22.560
Okay.

51:24.780 --> 51:25.540
Okay.

51:25.540 --> 51:42.080
So he basically just breathes a blizzard that covers both Rurik and Pergin, which, if

51:42.080 --> 51:49.080
you look over on the chat, there is a...

51:49.080 --> 51:56.200
Sorry, I walked away to get my kids in bed.

51:58.200 --> 52:04.200
If you look over in the chat, Scott is also MIA.

52:06.080 --> 52:06.680
Oh, okay.

52:07.560 --> 52:08.300
I can hear you, though.

52:09.140 --> 52:09.500
Okay.

52:09.500 --> 52:16.700
I will need you to make a reflex saving throw, which is based in...

52:16.700 --> 52:18.180
Which is in the chat there.

52:18.500 --> 52:21.500
You need me to make a reflex save.

52:22.640 --> 52:23.160
No.

52:23.640 --> 52:24.020
No.

52:24.300 --> 52:25.440
You weren't caught in the...

52:25.440 --> 52:27.840
You were not caught in the breath weapon.

52:27.980 --> 52:28.100
Oh.

52:29.580 --> 52:31.000
That's mildly terrifying.

52:31.020 --> 52:31.660
Okay, that's much better.

52:31.660 --> 52:32.380
There is a breath weapon.

52:32.560 --> 52:32.880
Okay.

52:33.360 --> 52:34.360
Well, that's a pass.

52:34.360 --> 52:35.360
Much, much better.

52:35.360 --> 52:35.640
Okay.

52:39.500 --> 52:43.700
Wow.

52:46.580 --> 52:48.880
I was kind of expecting that to be a crit success.

52:49.400 --> 52:50.200
Holy crap.

52:56.620 --> 52:57.260
All right.

53:03.920 --> 53:05.940
It was not a crit success.

53:06.600 --> 53:07.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

53:07.720 --> 53:29.520
So, as the frost breath weighs over you, Rurik takes 15 points of cold damage, and Ruriken

53:29.520 --> 53:32.700
takes 30 points of cold damage.

53:33.140 --> 53:34.920
That's going to need to be addressed immediately.

53:34.920 --> 53:35.840
Not good at all.

53:35.840 --> 53:36.200
Okay.

53:37.720 --> 53:42.140
All right.

53:42.140 --> 54:07.380
All right.

54:07.720 --> 54:26.140
All right.

54:26.140 --> 54:33.760
Are we down a award?

54:33.760 --> 54:41.800
I don't know what a warg I thought there were four

54:41.800 --> 54:47.800
no there are three yeah there's just a really big one

54:47.800 --> 54:54.780
a really big bipedal warg yeah he's not feeling good he's all right he's not feeling good

54:54.780 --> 55:03.740
yeah yeah yeah it would have been a lot better had um two of the three

55:03.740 --> 55:15.500
people hit this round um yeah uh you will get no argument from us

55:15.500 --> 55:27.600
no no this one basically just starts running towards the uh brick towards the

55:27.600 --> 55:32.080
um other um the other dwarves

55:32.080 --> 55:37.400
and you hear cries

55:37.400 --> 55:47.520
well you're not but but you know it's not their job just to eat you guys

55:47.520 --> 55:58.200
and then

55:58.200 --> 56:00.900
let's see

56:00.900 --> 56:03.840
his speed

56:03.840 --> 56:14.900
he jumps down into the ravine

56:14.900 --> 56:28.540
and he's going to attack her again because

56:28.540 --> 56:36.220
brick was hidden from him so his initial target would have been her again

56:36.220 --> 56:41.540
he's going to perform

56:41.540 --> 57:00.860
and he's going to miss excellent love to see it

57:00.860 --> 57:02.100
oh sure

57:02.100 --> 57:05.300
and he's going to miss

57:05.300 --> 57:09.180
excellent love to see it

57:09.180 --> 57:18.500
try twice makes makes a jaw strike if they damage the living creature

57:18.500 --> 57:19.440
nope

57:19.440 --> 57:22.880
very sad but

57:22.880 --> 57:26.760
he doesn't get to munch on your uh munch on your entrails

57:26.760 --> 57:29.720
all right

57:29.720 --> 57:33.000
yeah

57:33.000 --> 57:34.140
you're up

57:34.140 --> 57:36.540
persistent damage

57:36.540 --> 57:39.120
yeah all right

57:39.120 --> 57:41.720
uh a question

57:41.720 --> 57:46.100
how tall is this cliff thing here

57:46.100 --> 57:54.300
um it's it's not terribly tall it's probably um it's about 15 20 feet tall

57:54.300 --> 57:56.120
we'll call it 20

57:56.120 --> 57:57.580
no we'll call it 15

57:57.580 --> 57:58.680
okay

57:58.680 --> 58:01.140
excellent

58:01.140 --> 58:02.200
excellent

58:02.200 --> 58:05.040
i forgot

58:05.040 --> 58:08.960
we need to be precise in our distances in this game

58:08.960 --> 58:11.240
the that is that is accurate

58:11.240 --> 58:12.720
it it does matter

58:12.720 --> 58:15.720
um

58:15.720 --> 58:24.400
uh

58:24.400 --> 58:26.320
uh

58:27.580 --> 58:32.720
okay

58:32.720 --> 58:33.040
okay

58:33.040 --> 58:37.040
uh

58:37.040 --> 58:40.660
that is

58:40.660 --> 58:42.440
i cannot make that check

58:42.440 --> 58:45.280
um

58:45.280 --> 58:46.440
okay

58:46.440 --> 58:53.440
can i

58:53.440 --> 58:54.060
uh

58:54.060 --> 58:54.820
before i ask

58:54.820 --> 58:55.700
let me

58:55.700 --> 58:57.180
make sure

58:57.180 --> 58:58.120
i'm not

58:58.120 --> 59:00.220
smoking the good stuff

59:00.220 --> 59:02.300
okay

59:02.300 --> 59:03.080
okay okay

59:03.080 --> 59:03.640
i can

59:03.640 --> 59:05.240
i can make that happen

59:05.240 --> 59:07.240
um

59:07.240 --> 59:07.660
all right

59:07.660 --> 59:08.780
here's what i'm gonna do

59:08.780 --> 59:11.200
i'm going to

59:11.200 --> 59:11.840
uh

59:11.840 --> 59:13.980
assume a couple of things

59:13.980 --> 59:15.360
and you tell me if i'm incorrect

59:15.360 --> 59:16.600
okay

59:16.600 --> 59:17.160
but

59:17.160 --> 59:18.280
i'm going to

59:18.280 --> 59:19.040
spend

59:19.040 --> 59:20.160
uh

59:20.160 --> 59:20.980
some movement

59:20.980 --> 59:22.940
to like

59:22.940 --> 59:25.160
climb

59:25.160 --> 59:26.180
a little bit

59:26.180 --> 59:27.040
um

59:27.040 --> 59:27.600
i'm assuming

59:27.600 --> 59:29.900
i can get up onto one of these smaller spaces

59:29.900 --> 59:32.120
as difficult terrain

59:32.120 --> 59:35.060
yes

59:35.060 --> 59:35.680
you can

59:35.680 --> 59:36.540
okay

59:36.540 --> 59:38.120
so i'm gonna do that

59:38.120 --> 59:39.320
uh

59:39.320 --> 59:40.540
unfortunately that is

59:40.540 --> 59:41.780
kind of a whole

59:41.780 --> 59:43.360
action

59:43.360 --> 59:43.880
isn't it

59:43.880 --> 59:44.480
oh wait

59:44.480 --> 59:45.440
am i gonna do this

59:45.440 --> 59:45.860
shit

59:45.860 --> 59:47.000
i don't have enough actions

59:47.000 --> 59:48.000
one two

59:48.000 --> 59:52.420
i have to reload

59:52.420 --> 59:57.000
hmm

59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.000
hmm

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.580
would tumble through work

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:06.340
if

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:06.760
is

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.200
that what you're going for

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:09.040
to get to the

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:12.420
which work that's moving towards the doors

01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:13.420
yeah

01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:14.600
well the problem is i just

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:15.780
i need line of sight on it

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:16.900
i need to get elevated

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:20.020
that's the problem

01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:22.900
um

01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:29.220
it's hard to see over that giant black werewolf

01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:35.480
oh hang on

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.280
um

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:40.160
what does this do

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:41.080
uh

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.960
plus ten

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:44.080
um

01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:46.780
yeah

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:47.780
yeah

01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:52.780
hmm

01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:53.780
hmm

01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:59.420
yep

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:00.600
yep yep yep yep yep yep

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:01.560
highest high jump

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:02.280
i don't

01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:03.780
have that

01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:06.780
okay

01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:07.320
well

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:08.120
um

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.160
since i can't do all of that

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.580
we are instead

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:13.080
going to

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:13.540
uh

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:17.960
do the next best thing

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:18.960
how are you doing scott

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.300
you're not doing well

01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:21.120
uh

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:22.300
you're not feeling good

01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:24.500
all right

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:25.720
so what i'm gonna do

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:29.560
is i'm going to

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.720
use

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:32.740
uh

01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:33.380
yeah yeah yeah

01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:34.680
this will be fine

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:35.700
this will be fine

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:36.400
um

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.400
i'm going to use

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:37.780
uh

01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:38.940
my

01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:40.040
new ability

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:41.020

01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:42.780
doctor's visitation

01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:44.960
um

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:45.940
for an action

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:47.640
i stride

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:49.220
um

01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:50.340
so we will stride

01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:51.040
uh

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:51.300
we're gonna

01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:51.880
oh i have to

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:53.660
uh

01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:54.060
maybe

01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:54.720
five

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:57.800
five

01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:58.800
uh

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:00.440
i don't know how to do that

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:00.960
five ten

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.200
fifteen

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:03.020
twenty

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:03.540
twenty five

no

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:04.840
i can do this without

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:05.580
uh

01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:06.140
tumbling through

01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:06.880
i can go around

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:07.620
and go

01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:08.300
twenty five

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:09.420
i'm gonna go over

01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:09.640
here

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:10.320
um

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:11.060
i'm going to

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:12.960
maybe get hit by

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:13.760
as you do

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:14.580
an attack

01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:15.140
yep

01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:15.580
yep

01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:16.860
you do get targeted

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:17.640
by an attack

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:18.360
yep

01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.260
yep

01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:20.740
the werewolf

01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:23.960
wields his great axe

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.400
mm-hmm

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:29.040
what the heck

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:31.080
did you design this

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:31.940
for four people

01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:37.040
um

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:37.640

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:41.160
roar

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:41.980
that's all right

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:42.580
they're not rolling

01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:43.460
any better than we are

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:44.560
not really

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.300
um

01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:45.620
i

01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:46.060
this

01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:47.440
this is

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:49.000
this is a difficult

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:49.760
encounter

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:51.220
for three people

01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:52.960
but it should be

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:54.500
manageable

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:55.120
now

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:55.820
that's assuming

01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:56.420
that you guys

01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:57.420
actually start hitting

01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:57.980
but

01:02:57.980 --> 01:02:58.780
right

01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:00.280
uh

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:00.640
all right

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:00.840
cool

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:01.380
uh

01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:02.420
so i moved there

01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:03.640
and then as part of the same action

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:05.500
i bust out my healer's kit

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.580
and i am going to battle medicine

01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:08.600
uh

01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:09.000
hergan

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.040
uh

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.460
which is

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:15.720
reet wounds

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:16.460
right

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:17.880
is what this thing's called

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:18.600
yep

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:23.420
what do i have on this check

01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:24.680
of a plus nine

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:28.580
uh

01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:30.540
do i go for the expert

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.300
i don't think i do

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:33.300
i think that seems

01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:34.420
bad

01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:37.180
yep

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:38.180
we're not going to do that

01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:39.380
we're just going to do a

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:41.600
a trained

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.360
yield

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:43.440
trained check

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.880
all right

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:47.200
so this was a dc 15

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:48.440
we nailed it

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:50.700
uh

01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:51.480
we crit

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:52.860
so you heal for 16

01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:54.920
yes

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:57.140
you are immune

01:03:57.140 --> 01:03:58.060
to battle meditation

01:03:58.060 --> 01:03:59.060
battle medicine

01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:00.040
for i don't know

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:00.420
how long

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:01.400
at least this combat

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:02.040
i'll have to check

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:02.500
after that

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:02.800
all right

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.940
so that was action one

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:04.960
uh

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:05.720
action two

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:06.660
is i'm now going to do

01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:07.380
the thing i said

01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:08.800
where i'm going to move

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.760
up some difficult terrain

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:11.620
somewhere

01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:12.220
somehow

01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:13.280
it doesn't matter

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.200
um

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.420
and then for action three

01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:16.480
i'm going to use

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:17.420
my other new ability

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:18.360
i've not used yet

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:20.520
my black powder boost

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:21.420
uh

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:22.440
so rurik is going to

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:23.220
rocket jump

01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:24.340
uh he runs

01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:25.160
and scrambles up

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:25.720
some of the

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:26.320
the cliff

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:27.360
and then

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:28.920
he jumps

01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:29.520
and kind of

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:30.620
shoots his shotgun

01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:31.260
downward

01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:32.440
uh somehow

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:33.880
defying all physics

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:35.080
and propelling him

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.080
to the top of the cliff

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:38.120
all right

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:40.880
wow

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.280
that's me

01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:44.900
very cool

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:46.220
it's impressive

01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:47.540
it adds plus 10

01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:48.140
to my jump

01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:51.120
somehow

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:51.760
a shotgun

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:52.580
kickback

01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:54.080
blew a whole

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:54.820
ass dwarf

01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:55.300
10 feet

01:04:55.300 --> 01:04:55.760
in the air

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:56.340
i don't know

01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:56.920
how that works

01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:57.280
but

01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:58.760
it sounds

01:04:58.760 --> 01:04:59.320
appropriate

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:00.440
yeah yeah

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:01.740
black powder

01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:02.980
you're right

01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:03.660
emlor

01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:04.740
you are up

01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:08.640
you're 25 feet

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:09.180
away

01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:11.240
um

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:16.460
so you have to

01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:17.180
oh and

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:17.900
as far as

01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:19.760
oh go ahead

01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:22.240
i just need a little bit of help here

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.060
with

01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:23.940
um

01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:29.360
i'm going to use the versatile blast feat

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:32.800
so that i can change my

01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:35.240
elemental damage type

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:36.880
to fire

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:39.760
okay

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:40.820
um

01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:42.020
um

01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:42.620
let's see

01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:43.960
versatile blast

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:51.980
i'm assuming

01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:53.680
i'm assuming that would work with

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:57.900
it doesn't require an action

01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:02.700
assuming that would work with the

01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:07.980
oh

01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:08.320
you

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.420
you can't switch to fire

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:11.640
um

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:14.820
your versatile blast is what allows you to use electricity

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:17.320
oh

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.700
otherwise your metal would just be

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:20.820
i see how that's

01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:22.200
piercing and slashing

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:23.020
i see

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:23.520
all right

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:23.860
no more

01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:24.300
thanks

01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:24.920
it's all right

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:25.420
now

01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:27.080
um

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:27.380
okay

01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:27.820
yeah

01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:28.540
no worries

01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:29.720
um

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:30.680
okay

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:31.680
okay

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:34.320
all right

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:35.920
so we'll just do the spines

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.640
shards

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:40.360
thingies

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:43.360
uh

01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:44.520
the magnetic pinions

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:46.400
i was gonna go

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:47.400
shard strike

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:50.360
but

01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:50.860
okay

01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:52.720
i'm okay with the magnetic pinions too

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:53.920
i'm gonna supply an attack

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:54.780
well

01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:55.240
yeah

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:56.740
either way

01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:57.660
um

01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:01.080
so the magnetic pinions will let you target

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:02.160
three creatures

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:03.720
that are within range

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.320
um

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:07.100
whereas the shard strike would

01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:10.840
either travels in a line directly from you

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:13.080
and hits everything that's within it

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:13.440
or

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.120
if you position yourself

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:18.100
you've got a 15 foot cone that you can use

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:19.220
um

01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:20.880
cause that damage

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:24.400
so if you've got them clumped together

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:25.260
and you

01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:26.340
and you're right there

01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:26.980
like you could

01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:29.500
it's effectively like a burning hand sort of thing

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:31.540
with

01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:32.420
only it's metal

01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:32.980
with the

01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:34.440
magnetic pinions

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:34.800
yeah

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:35.740
roll up

01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:37.040
up to three creatures

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.380
that's the shard strike

01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:38.560
oh

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:42.700
the magnetic pinions

01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:44.220
you just target

01:07:44.220 --> 01:07:45.520
up to three creatures

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.200
any

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.220
three creatures

01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:47.880
within 60

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:48.780
there's no template

01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:49.620
applied

01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:50.180
okay

01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:50.560
yeah

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:52.780
so

01:07:52.780 --> 01:07:54.020
it's no template applied

01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:55.460
you just individually target

01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:55.900
three

01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:56.520
creatures

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:59.680
um

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:03.740
yeah

01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:04.440
i think

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:05.340
and from a

01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:08.840
i think it makes sense

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:09.960
to stand down there

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.160
and do the shard strike

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:13.680
with the cone

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:14.220
like you're saying

01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:14.420
okay

01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:16.160
i think that makes sense

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:16.660
okay

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:18.700
well and

01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:19.120
just

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:20.380
just from a

01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:21.280
um

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:22.460
from a

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:23.200
uh

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.420
tactical perspective

01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:25.720
right now

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:27.200
you guys are outgunned

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:27.960
because they

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:29.200
they have more actions

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:30.000
than you have

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.280
action economy

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:32.720
is a really big thing here

01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:33.800
so

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:35.020
you need to be

01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:35.960
dropping people

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:37.100
um

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:37.900
and

01:08:37.900 --> 01:08:38.680
that's not

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:39.580
specifically

01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:40.640
for you

01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:41.100
jason

01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:41.660
that's just

01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:42.580
in general

01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:44.300
this is what needs to happen

01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.160
is you need to be dropping enemies

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.040
because

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.680
if you're not dropping enemies

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:50.580
they'll all attack you

01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:51.660
and you will all die

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:53.040
so

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.720
um

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.120
anything that you can do

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:56.580
to

01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:57.660
drop

01:08:57.660 --> 01:08:58.420
at least

01:08:58.420 --> 01:08:59.320
one enemy

01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:00.700
at this round

01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:02.080
will help you out

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:02.580
so

01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:04.280
just a

01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:04.860
random

01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:05.480
just

01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:06.120
just some

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:06.640
tactical

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:07.720
recommendation

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:08.540
about this

01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:09.360
if you spread out

01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:10.040
your damage

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:12.580
you're

01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:13.280
you're gonna

01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:13.940
you're

01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:14.280
you're

01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:15.340
you're gonna die

01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:17.200
there's

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:18.180
um

01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:20.640
which i guess that's okay

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:21.240
we can

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:21.560
just

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:22.840
pick up uh

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:24.800
pick up crown of the immortals

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:25.120
but

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.460
um

01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:28.140
but yeah

01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:28.800
from

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.020
from a tactical perspective

01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:30.480
that's

01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:31.280
that's something that

01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:32.980
you guys need to focus on doing

01:09:32.980 --> 01:09:34.220
before you start

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:34.760
you know

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:36.480
before you worry about

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:39.280
doing the most damage

01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:39.880
by doing

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:40.660
by doing

01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:41.280
like

01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:43.060
range stuff

01:09:43.060 --> 01:09:43.860
from which

01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:45.340
i'm not saying

01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:46.640
to

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:47.140
to

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:48.920
i'm not saying that

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.160
shardstrike won't do it

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:50.760
because it

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:51.640
because it might

01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:52.480
um

01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.580
i'm just

01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:54.380
like

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:55.140
like i said

01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:56.500
it's just kind of like

01:09:56.500 --> 01:09:58.220
i'm seeing rurik

01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:00.080
run after the

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.520
run after the one

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:02.480
warg

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:02.800
which

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:04.680
arguably he needs to do

01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:06.220
but i don't know

01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:06.640
we need

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:07.600
we need you guys

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:08.880
to start focusing fire

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.660
i think he's just getting out of the

01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:12.200
immediacy of attacks

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.740
well

01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:15.080
yeah

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:15.860
either way

01:10:15.860 --> 01:10:16.940
but like basically

01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:17.700
the

01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:19.100
like

01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:20.520
you guys need to be focusing fire

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:22.060
and you need to be dropping bad guys

01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:26.040
or this is gonna be a really long fight that

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:27.360
uh

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.100
this is gonna be a really long fight that

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:30.000
you might

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:30.760
end up

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:31.900
dying from

01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:32.760
so

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:39.300
so

01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:42.320
that whole pep talk was not specifically for you jason

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:43.360
i was just trying to

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:46.440
i was just trying to figure out the opportune moment to

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:46.880
to

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:47.980
to

01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:49.280
to point that out

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:49.760
so

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:52.000
it wasn't specifically like

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.780
you should not do your plan

01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:54.340
so

01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:54.820
uh

01:10:54.820 --> 01:10:54.960
i

01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:55.500
even again

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:56.300
i don't have a

01:10:56.300 --> 01:10:57.360
flipping plan

01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:57.960
i just

01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:00.300
don't know how to

01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:02.480
all right so

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:03.180
anyway

01:11:03.180 --> 01:11:05.260
i guess there's

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:06.020
there's him

01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:06.980
and then there's

01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:08.580
okay

01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:15.160
i don't know how to

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:16.660
yeah so if you do your

01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:19.480
if you do your magnetic pinions

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:20.600
i was

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:22.100
yeah you should be able to hit

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:23.420
both the witch warg

01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:24.320
and the glutton

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:25.240
if you

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:26.900
if that's what your goal is

01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:28.900
the witch warg and the werewolf

01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:30.900
i feel like

01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:32.620
the shard strike is a better

01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:33.320
play there

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:34.240
i don't know maybe not

01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:35.300
i mean if it's gonna do

01:11:35.300 --> 01:11:35.580
okay

01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:36.560
it says it's gonna do

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:37.800
2d4

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:38.800
on both

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:39.900
like

01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:42.140
it's 2d6

01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:43.320
right

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:44.080
the strike is

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:45.560
the magnetic pinions is

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:47.380
basically looks like

01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:48.120
4d4

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:50.700
am i reading that wrong

01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:53.580
um

01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:57.040
magnetic pinions

01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.400
is

01:11:58.400 --> 01:11:59.140
yeah

01:11:59.140 --> 01:11:59.640
2d4

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:00.100
bludgeoning

01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:00.940
and 2d4

01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:01.540
piercing

01:12:01.540 --> 01:12:03.540
so

01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:03.920
yeah

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:05.180
um

01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:06.080
the difference

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:06.820
though is

01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:07.680
magnetic pinions

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:08.580
is an actual

01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:09.200
attack

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:10.040
whereas

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:12.200
um

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:13.560
shard strike

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:14.680
is a

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:15.180
reflex

01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:16.240
um

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:16.980
is a reflex

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:17.460
save

01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:18.720
so

01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:20.100
the question is

01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:21.020
do you think that

01:12:21.020 --> 01:12:22.620
wolves are

01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:23.080
agile

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:29.940
yes they are

01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:33.700
now you do have

01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:34.580
the thing about

01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:35.100
like the

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:35.980
the werewolf

01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:38.400
started out as an

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:38.800
ogre

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:39.560
so

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:42.780
maybe

01:12:42.780 --> 01:12:43.900
he's not

01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:44.300
agile

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:44.960
but the

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:45.540
the wolves

01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:46.060
definitely

01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:46.760
you know

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:47.600
would probably

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:48.860
fall more on the

01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:49.820
agile side of things

01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:50.720
not to get too

01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:51.460
metagamey

01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:51.920
right

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:52.740
so probably

01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:53.340
i

01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:55.700
i'm gonna do

01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:56.620
i'm gonna attack

01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:57.340
the

01:12:57.340 --> 01:12:59.040
ogre wolf

01:12:59.040 --> 01:12:59.480
thing

01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:02.420
um

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:03.600
attack him

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:04.580
i'm gonna do

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:05.480
the

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:08.160
um

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:11.760
charge strike

01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:14.960
as the spines

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:16.300
for a

01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:16.540
for a 30

01:13:16.540 --> 01:13:16.920
foot

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:18.080
line of

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:18.500
attack

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:20.140
um

01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:20.900
okay

01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:26.460
how do i

01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:27.700
how do i set

01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:28.140
that up

01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:28.520
i guess

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:29.700
um

01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:30.260
it's not an

01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:31.040
elemental blast

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:31.540
um

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:33.020
so i'm not

01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:33.640
doing that

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:35.740
okay

01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:36.820
so if you

01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:37.380
do not

01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:37.940
move

01:13:37.940 --> 01:13:39.640
you will

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:39.660
you will

01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:40.440
also

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:41.040
shoot

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:41.760
her again

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:43.920
so that

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:44.240
one was

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:44.700
the line

01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:45.200
attack

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:47.560
that's the

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:47.780
line

01:13:47.780 --> 01:13:48.060
attack

01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:48.680
yeah

01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:49.120
the one i was

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:49.440
looking at

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:50.000
was a line

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.180
that's gonna hit

01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:51.840
her again too

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:52.280
right

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:54.960
everything that

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.120
everything that's

01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:57.000
in that line

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:57.580
gets hit

01:13:57.580 --> 01:13:59.800
so if you

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:00.700
don't move

01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:01.660
your line

01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:02.080
will go

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:03.060
straight through

01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:03.600
her again

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:05.000
and into

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:05.900
the werewolf

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:07.300
so you will

01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:07.900
hit the werewolf

01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:08.540
but you also

01:14:08.540 --> 01:14:09.160
hit her again

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:11.980
oh

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.200
it's a template

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:13.760
interesting

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:15.020
okay

01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:15.960
yeah

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:17.340
yeah i can

01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:17.660
you know

01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:18.460
yeah obviously

01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:19.120
it makes sense

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:19.420
to

01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:23.060
all right

01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:23.980
i can't move

01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:24.700
there we go

01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:26.160
that misses

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:26.560
her again

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:29.680
uh

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:30.420
that

01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:31.600
should

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:32.920
um

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:33.520
i think

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:34.020
that one

01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:34.740
will actually

01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:39.160
not only

01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:39.720
will that

01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:40.360
miss

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:41.080
her again

01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:42.960
but also

01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:43.560
it will

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:44.180
go

01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:45.420
pick up

01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:45.740
the other

01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:45.980
guy

01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:46.500
through the

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:47.200
witch warg

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:47.720
as well

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:48.460
yeah i'll get

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:48.760
the other

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:49.280
guy too

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:52.740
um

01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:55.840
that sounds

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:56.360
like money

01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:56.960
right

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.140
uh

01:14:58.140 --> 01:14:59.720
so

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:01.320
how do i

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:03.620
how do i set

01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:04.360
this up so

01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:04.940
that

01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:08.260
what buttons

01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:08.840
do i need to

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:09.220
click

01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:10.200
i guess

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.320
to

01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:12.380
keep the attack

01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:12.860
going

01:15:12.860 --> 01:15:13.480
so what

01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:14.480
and

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:15.700
include

01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:16.540
like the

01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:17.100
giant

01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:18.020
he's a giant

01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:19.000
so then i get

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:19.860
the pluses

01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:20.200

01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:22.800
good jazz

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:23.100
right

01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:23.120

01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:31.780
scott

01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:32.480
was the

01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:34.600
scott

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:34.980
was up

01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:35.780
he hit him

01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:36.100
so

01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:36.560
hurric

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:39.920
murder

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:40.480
death

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:40.860
kill

01:24:40.860 --> 01:24:42.440
so the

01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:43.020
only

01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:44.760
thing to

01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:45.160
do is

01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:45.420
hit the

01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:45.920
big guy

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:46.280
in front

01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:47.400
of me

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:48.700
that would

01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:49.360
probably be

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:49.640
a good

01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:50.060
idea

01:24:50.060 --> 01:24:52.200
i think

01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:52.600
i have

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:52.880
him

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:54.140
targeted

01:24:54.140 --> 01:24:54.760
but he's

01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:55.640
so large

01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:57.280
i know

01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:58.060
yes

01:24:58.060 --> 01:25:03.180
he's

01:25:03.180 --> 01:25:04.520
only

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:05.140
one

01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:05.700
oh

01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:06.500
not even

01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:06.880
equipped

01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:07.320
with any

01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:07.780
weapons

01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:08.600
or anything

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:09.180
let me

01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:09.780
back up

01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:12.260
pull out

01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:12.720
your weapons

01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:13.700
sorry about

01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:13.980
that

01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:16.160
it's okay

01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:43.860
where was that

01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:44.320
last

01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:44.340
last

01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:46.100
that's

01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:46.440
too

01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:49.220
that's

01:25:49.220 --> 01:25:49.440
a

01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:49.760
critical

01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:50.720
and a

01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:51.300
regular

01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:51.720
hit

01:25:51.720 --> 01:25:53.220
that seems

01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:54.060
pretty good

01:25:54.060 --> 01:25:55.440
go ahead and

01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:55.780
roll that

01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:56.400
damage

01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.540
he's gonna

01:25:58.540 --> 01:25:59.220
die after

01:25:59.220 --> 01:25:59.840
just one

01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:00.160
i would

01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:00.520
think

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:03.160
maybe

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:04.860
that's pretty

01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:05.540
good damage

01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:08.440
you're doing

01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:09.500
fire damage

01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:10.020
yeah

01:26:10.020 --> 01:26:12.340
get rocked

01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:18.700
all right

01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:19.180
you have

01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:19.640
officially

01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:20.420
killed

01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:21.840
the

01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:23.200
the

01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:23.840
werewolf

01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:24.280
what

01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:25.180
what is

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:25.540
your

01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:26.480
what do

01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:26.700
you want

01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:27.080
it to look

01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:27.460
like

01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:29.700
he's so

01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:30.420
large i

01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:30.820
don't even

01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:31.440
know how

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:32.040
to attack

01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:32.340
him

01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:34.600
like i

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:35.060
have a

01:26:35.060 --> 01:26:35.480
jump

01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:36.160
ability

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:38.020
sure

01:26:38.020 --> 01:26:39.160
you can

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:39.540
yeah i

01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:39.900
guess i

01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:40.420
would take

01:26:40.420 --> 01:26:40.800
down

01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:41.780
achilles

01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:42.300
tendon

01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:43.100
with the

01:26:43.100 --> 01:26:43.620
axe

01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:44.820
and then

01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:45.460
the left

01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:46.140
hand with

01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:46.680
the hammer

01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:47.100
to the

01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:47.400
head

01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:49.100
you smash

01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:49.580
the same

01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:50.040
spot

01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:52.360
that the

01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:53.000
hole is

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:53.460
from the

01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:54.160
first shot

01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:55.020
from ramsay

01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:56.440
nice

01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:57.280
all right

01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:57.940
you you

01:26:57.940 --> 01:26:58.600
hear a

01:26:58.600 --> 01:26:59.020
crunch

01:26:59.020 --> 01:26:59.560
and then

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:00.640
and then

01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:02.620
a sploosh

01:27:02.620 --> 01:27:04.420
as your

01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:05.380
hammer goes

01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:06.260
all the way

01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:06.940
through its

01:27:06.940 --> 01:27:07.300
skull

01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:09.260
now scott

01:27:09.260 --> 01:27:09.980
you have

01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:10.920
two more

01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:11.380
actions

01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:11.720
what are

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:11.880
you gonna

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:12.260
do

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:16.800
i don't

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:17.160
want to

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:18.180
get closer

01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:21.300
excuse me

01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:22.620
i'm blanking

01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:23.220
here

01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:24.180
yeah

01:27:24.180 --> 01:27:24.760
yeah

01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:25.340
it's good

01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:27.900
i'm afraid

01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:28.580
of this guy

01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:29.140
to the right

01:27:29.140 --> 01:27:29.520
because he

01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:30.140
did 30

01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:31.000
damage when

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:31.340
he just

01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:31.900
breathed on

01:27:31.900 --> 01:27:32.380
me without

01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:32.820
a kit

01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:33.600
critical hit

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:34.260
i think

01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:34.720
that was

01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:35.640
right

01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:36.440
excessive

01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:37.260
that's a

01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:37.460
little

01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:40.820
it was

01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:41.280
excessive

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:42.920
but at

01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:43.800
in this

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:44.060
game

01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:44.660
breath weapons

01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:44.980
are not

01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:45.520
something you

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:45.840
can do

01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:46.440
every single

01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:46.800
round

01:27:46.800 --> 01:27:47.860
so the

01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:48.240
ones that

01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:48.680
you really

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:49.020
have to

01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:49.440
worry about

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:49.740
are the

01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:50.120
ones that

01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:50.600
haven't

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:51.060
breathed

01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:51.340
yet

01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:52.440
right

01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:54.260
oh my

01:27:54.260 --> 01:27:54.840
gosh

01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:57.000

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:57.500
we hit on

01:27:57.500 --> 01:27:58.000
this guy

01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:58.660
oh my

01:27:58.660 --> 01:27:59.000
god

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.000

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:06.580
all right

01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:07.560
you want

01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:09.420
to uh

01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:10.900
you want

01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:11.160
to use

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:11.440
the hero

01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:11.740
point

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:15.940
another one

01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:16.260
because we're

01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:16.600
already at

01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:17.300
nine o'clock

01:28:35.260 --> 01:28:35.880
critical hit

i can do

01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:43.960
one and

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:44.660

giant

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:24.540
it doesn't

01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:24.980
matter

01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:26.660

it is

01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:27.860
the

01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:28.240

01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:32.320
succeeds

01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:35.160
regardless

01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:43.600
kind of

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:43.820
cool

01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:44.760
okay

01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:47.120
so

01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:47.680
we'll

01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:48.140
go ahead

01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:48.560
and drop

the

01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:51.780
thing

01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:52.360
on you

01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:52.660

01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:53.600
got

01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:53.860
a

01:32:58.700 --> 01:32:59.840
hit

01:32:59.840 --> 01:32:59.860
hit

01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:00.080
that

01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:00.420
okay

you're

01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:02.340
up

01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:03.300
all right

01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:03.960
that one

01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:04.500
run

01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:05.280
run off

01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:05.800
run off

01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:07.180
uh

01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:07.800
no it

01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:08.520
was continuing

01:33:08.520 --> 01:33:09.200
to go

01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:09.860
after the

01:33:09.860 --> 01:33:10.540
dwarves

01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:11.420
yeah

01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:11.740
yeah

01:33:11.740 --> 01:33:11.960
yeah

01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:12.440
but it's

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:13.020
no longer

01:33:13.020 --> 01:33:14.780
it's

01:33:14.780 --> 01:33:15.220
yeah it's

01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:15.560
no longer

01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:16.080
on the map

01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:17.400
effectively

01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:17.800
out of

01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:18.160
range

01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:18.520
okay

01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:19.160
all right

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:20.120
uh

01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:21.060
i will

01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:22.460
self

01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:23.040
and

01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:24.280
reload

01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:25.580
that seems

01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:26.140
to be

01:33:26.140 --> 01:33:26.820
the best

01:33:26.820 --> 01:33:27.300
thing to

01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:27.540
do

01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:28.060
which one

01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:28.440
of these

01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:28.920
okay that

01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:29.360
one's going

01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:30.100
first

01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:31.980
but we have

01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:32.460
someone going

01:33:32.460 --> 01:33:33.200
before it

01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:33.980
so i think

01:33:33.980 --> 01:33:35.140
that's actually

01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:36.140
fine

01:33:36.140 --> 01:33:38.520
because you

01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:39.120
can aoe

01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:39.720
so here's

01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:39.960
what i'm

01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:40.200
gonna do

01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:40.520
i'm gonna

01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:41.000
hide

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.900
uh

01:33:43.900 --> 01:33:46.120
hide

i'm gonna

01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:48.800
try to

01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:49.020
hide

01:33:49.020 --> 01:33:50.000
and then

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:50.300
uh

01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:50.660
hopefully

01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:52.500
i will

01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:54.260
have hidden

01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:54.700
from

01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:55.840
this dude

01:33:59.740 --> 01:34:00.380
fire bullet

01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:01.920
because that

01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:02.440
seems to be

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:02.700
the thing

01:34:02.700 --> 01:34:03.080

again

01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:07.100
or not

01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:07.480
re-roll

01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:08.040
uh

01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:08.360
reload

01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:09.040
that's the

01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:09.560
re i want

01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:09.920

01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:12.980
sure i got

01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:13.400
a bullet

01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:13.760
ready

01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:14.380
all right

01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:14.720
that's

01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:15.200
that's me

01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:15.960

i got

01:35:16.340 --> 01:35:16.780
all right

01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:20.000
okay

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.540
uh dimmler

01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:23.320
oh yeah

01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:24.220
uh-huh

01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:25.100
yeah

01:35:25.100 --> 01:35:27.100
yeah

01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:29.100
seems like a

01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:30.100
good aoe time

01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:30.740
i don't know

01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:31.540
what aoe means

01:35:31.540 --> 01:35:32.200
but okay

01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:34.900
area of effect

01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:35.640
oh

01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:36.300
yeah

01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:36.800
seems like

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:37.080
you've got

01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:38.160
a few

01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:39.960
different things

01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:40.320
that do

01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:40.880
damage to

01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:41.180
multiple

01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:41.800
things

01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:42.840
i

01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:43.640
believe

01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:45.340
i have

01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:46.600
one or

01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:47.140
two

01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:50.280
um

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:53.880
so i guess

01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:54.300
what i'm

01:35:54.300 --> 01:35:54.720
i'm not

01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:55.160
like that

01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:55.580
magnetic

01:35:55.580 --> 01:35:56.380
pinions

01:35:56.380 --> 01:35:58.080
um

01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:02.180
ranged

01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:03.280
uh

01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:03.880
roll

01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:04.900
against up

01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:05.420
to three

01:36:05.420 --> 01:36:05.760
within

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:06.880
60 feet

01:36:06.880 --> 01:36:13.760
yeah

01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:14.260
so it is

01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:14.740
specific

01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:15.440
like i can

01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:15.820
target

01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:16.780
so i don't

01:36:16.780 --> 01:36:17.320
need to

01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:19.720
so i think

01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:20.320
that's kind

01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:20.780
of the

01:36:20.780 --> 01:36:22.540
trick to

01:36:22.540 --> 01:36:23.540
pull there

01:36:23.540 --> 01:36:25.380
so yeah

01:36:25.380 --> 01:36:25.900
we'll do

01:36:25.900 --> 01:36:26.480
the magnetic

01:36:26.480 --> 01:36:27.500
pinions

01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:29.860
okay

01:36:29.860 --> 01:36:30.340
which

01:36:30.340 --> 01:36:31.860
is an

01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:32.240
impulse

01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:32.780
attack

01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:34.080
um

01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:35.500
um

01:36:35.500 --> 01:36:36.540
you are

01:36:36.540 --> 01:36:37.160
currently

01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:38.000
prone

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:39.720
um

01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:40.040
it will

01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:40.400
take you

01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:40.800
an action

01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:41.700
to stand

01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:42.120
up

01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:43.260
if you

01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:43.580
wanted

01:36:43.580 --> 01:36:44.040
to

01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:45.100
but the

01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:45.440
magnetic

01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:45.880
pinions

01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:46.560
will cost

01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:47.160
you three

01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:47.800
so

01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:48.940
do i need

01:36:48.940 --> 01:36:49.360
to stand

01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:49.560
up

01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:49.860
so

01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:52.360
um

01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:55.180
to do

01:36:55.180 --> 01:36:55.480
that

01:36:55.480 --> 01:36:56.140
i think

01:36:56.140 --> 01:36:56.360
it

01:36:56.360 --> 01:36:58.060
uh

01:36:58.060 --> 01:36:58.360
let's

01:36:58.360 --> 01:36:58.660
see

01:36:58.660 --> 01:36:59.180
here

01:36:59.180 --> 01:36:59.900
if you're

01:36:59.900 --> 01:37:00.320
lying on

01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:00.860
the ground

01:37:00.860 --> 01:37:01.440
you are

01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:02.300
off guard

01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:03.700
take a

01:37:03.700 --> 01:37:04.060
two

01:37:04.060 --> 01:37:04.920
circumstance

01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:05.320
penalty

01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:05.720
to it

01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:06.740
take a

01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:06.940
negative

01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:07.260
two

01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:07.820
circumstance

01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:08.160
penalty

01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:08.660
to your

01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:09.000
attack

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:09.180
roll

01:37:09.180 --> 01:37:09.700
so you're

01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:09.860
at

01:37:09.860 --> 01:37:10.160
negative

01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:10.600
two

01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:11.500
for your

01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:11.840
attack

01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:12.180
rolls

01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:12.680
if you're

01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:13.000
prone

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.140
um

01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:15.500
but

01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:16.080
i mean

01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:19.980
that's

01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:20.580
that's

01:37:20.580 --> 01:37:20.840
it

01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:21.640
so

01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:24.580
it's

01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:24.800
still

01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:25.180
kind of

01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:25.440
bad

01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:26.140
um

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:46.400
well

01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:46.980
whatever

01:37:46.980 --> 01:37:47.640
like

01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:48.980
what does

01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:49.640
it doesn't

01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:50.060
matter

01:37:50.060 --> 01:37:51.220
all right

01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:51.560
so

01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:52.300
i'm gonna

01:37:52.300 --> 01:37:52.960
continue to

01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:53.180
lay on

01:37:53.180 --> 01:37:53.480
the ground

01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:55.400
um

01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:55.620
okay

01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:58.760
what does

01:37:58.760 --> 01:37:59.100
it

01:37:59.100 --> 01:37:59.800
matter

01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:00.600
ah

01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:02.160
um

01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:08.880
i

01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:09.960
should

01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:11.800
get a

01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:12.400
plus

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:13.060
one

01:38:13.060 --> 01:38:14.420
on

01:38:14.420 --> 01:38:15.060
the

01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:15.720
damage

01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:16.120
but not

01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:16.440
on the

01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:17.440
attack

01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:19.340
it should

01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:19.760
be good

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:20.280
to just

01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:20.660
roll

01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:21.160
yeah

now

01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:24.740
i guess

01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:25.080
the other

01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:25.620
the only

01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:26.080
other thing

01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:53.220
bad roll

01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:56.460
that was a

01:38:56.460 --> 01:38:57.060
hit for

voice

magnetic

pinions

you do

01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:26.120
that

01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:26.700
on your

01:39:26.700 --> 01:39:26.980
end

01:39:26.980 --> 01:39:37.480
all right

01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:38.520
you successfully

01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:39.240
killed the

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:39.740
one that

01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:40.380
was almost

01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:40.920
dead

01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:42.240
and you

01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:42.820
have

01:39:42.820 --> 01:39:44.280
put the

01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:44.880
other one

01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:46.040
at death's

01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:46.440
door

01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:47.200
oh wow

01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:50.200
wow

01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:52.560
i guess i did

01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:52.920
like some

01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:53.580
damage there

01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:54.020
that was a

01:39:54.020 --> 01:39:54.580
nice one

01:39:54.580 --> 01:39:56.640
yeah

01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:57.260
magnetic

01:39:57.260 --> 01:39:57.780
pinions

01:39:57.780 --> 01:39:58.160
is

01:39:58.160 --> 01:39:59.280
like

01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:00.680
you were

01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:01.260
scoffing at

01:40:01.260 --> 01:40:01.660
the damage

01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:02.180
output on

01:40:02.180 --> 01:40:02.520
that thing

01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:02.880
no

01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:03.680
that one

01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:05.120
i wasn't

01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:06.480
i like

01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:07.200
i like

01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:07.860
4d4

01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:08.500
is way

01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:09.040
better than

01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:09.720
2d6

01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:10.480
i agree

01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:11.280
absolutely

01:40:11.280 --> 01:40:12.460
the problem

01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:13.200
is that

01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:13.600
like

01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:14.580
i have to

01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:14.960
take a

01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:15.600
turn now

01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:16.840
or not

01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:17.320
a turn

01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:17.780
but i have

01:40:17.780 --> 01:40:18.100
to take

01:40:18.100 --> 01:40:18.680
an action

01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:21.680
to reactivate

01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:22.880
channel gate

01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:23.280
right

01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:24.240
and i just

01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:24.720
wasn't sure

01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:25.060
that i wanted

01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:25.440
to spend

01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:26.160
that action

01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:28.660
at this

01:40:28.660 --> 01:40:28.960
point

01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:30.460
or earlier

01:40:30.460 --> 01:40:31.440
that's fair

01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:32.840
yeah

01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:33.680
that's fair

01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:35.580
and her again

01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:36.720
you're up

01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:48.120
i only move

01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:48.680
20 feet

01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:49.080
that's what

01:40:49.080 --> 01:40:49.560
it says

01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:50.200
but is that

01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:50.680
accurate

01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:52.720
uh that

01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:53.560
is accurate

01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:54.660
yeah

01:40:54.660 --> 01:40:56.420
dwarves

01:40:56.420 --> 01:40:57.420
don't move

01:40:57.420 --> 01:40:58.160
fast and

01:40:58.160 --> 01:40:59.260
you're heavily

01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:00.000
armored dwarves

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:00.740
so you

01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:01.440
move even

01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:01.820
slower

01:41:01.820 --> 01:41:02.500
heavily armored

01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:03.160
dwarf

01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:07.040
some hits

01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:10.120
looks like

01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:10.700
you got one

01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:11.500
hit at least

01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:12.080
nope

01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:12.980
two hits

01:41:12.980 --> 01:41:15.100
so i think

01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:15.740
one's probably

01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:16.480
all you need

01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:18.200
one's gonna

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:19.060
be enough

01:41:20.680 --> 01:41:22.240
especially

01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:22.760
with that

01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:23.720
fire

01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:24.560
thing

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:27.980
all right

01:41:27.980 --> 01:41:30.160
you

01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:30.980
successfully

01:41:30.980 --> 01:41:31.740
drop

01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:32.280
you

01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:33.240
successfully

01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:33.800
kill

01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:34.180
the

01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:35.020
last

01:41:35.020 --> 01:41:35.320
witch

01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:35.780
warg

01:41:35.780 --> 01:41:36.900
as you

01:41:36.900 --> 01:41:37.840
finish off

01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:38.280
that

01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:38.840
as you

01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:39.380
finish that

01:41:39.380 --> 01:41:39.980
one off

01:41:39.980 --> 01:41:41.280
you hear

01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:43.060
the company

01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:43.840
of dwarves

01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:45.140
in the distance

01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:46.160
starting to shout

01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:46.840
and

01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:47.980
um

01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:51.600
ruckus

01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:52.760
um

01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:54.600

01:41:58.020 --> 01:41:58.640
to make

01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:00.420
meals out of

01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:00.940
the remaining

01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:01.660
dwarves

01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:02.640
what do

01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:03.080

01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:08.540
to it

01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:09.120
we run

01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:09.780
to it

01:42:09.780 --> 01:42:11.440
right

01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:13.220
um

01:42:13.220 --> 01:42:14.360
soon as i'm

01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:14.900
in range

01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:17.220
bam bam bam

01:42:17.220 --> 01:42:21.460
emler gives

01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:21.840
a

01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:24.940
sigh

01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:25.960
followed by

01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:27.280
a groan

01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:28.740
as he

01:42:28.740 --> 01:42:29.880
pulls over

01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:30.460
and begins to

01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:31.000
pick himself

01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:33.340
prey

01:47:33.340 --> 01:47:37.660
because it

01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:38.160

01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:40.060
oh

01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:53.940
to that

01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:55.240
because it

01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:55.800
automatically

01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:56.340
switches

01:47:56.340 --> 01:47:56.980
yeah

i don't

01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:16.660

01:48:19.340 --> 01:48:19.640
best you

you know

01:52:13.180 --> 01:52:13.960
do some

01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:14.460
recovery

01:52:14.460 --> 01:52:14.840
or

01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:15.240
or

whatever

01:52:15.700 --> 01:52:16.880
um

01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:17.720
but

01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:18.880
um

01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:19.820
you hear

01:52:19.820 --> 01:52:21.260
off in the

01:52:21.260 --> 01:52:21.760
distance

01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:22.460
some

01:52:22.460 --> 01:52:23.640
thundering

01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:24.320
steps

01:52:24.320 --> 01:52:25.400
um

01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:27.000
and uh

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.320
and some

01:52:28.320 --> 01:52:29.240
um

01:52:29.240 --> 01:52:32.080
some

01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:32.760
large

01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:36.480
sort of

01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:37.360
noise

01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:38.140
as well

01:52:38.140 --> 01:52:39.100
um

01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:39.800
you become

01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:40.740
very aware

01:52:40.740 --> 01:52:41.620
that these

01:52:41.620 --> 01:52:42.200
aren't the

01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:42.840
only things

01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:43.480
hunting

01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:52.860
so the

01:52:52.860 --> 01:52:53.540
question is

01:52:53.540 --> 01:52:54.000

rest and

01:52:55.440 --> 01:52:55.820
recover

01:52:55.820 --> 01:52:56.500
or

01:52:56.500 --> 01:52:58.220
you just

01:52:58.220 --> 01:52:58.980
proceed

01:52:58.980 --> 01:52:59.560
forward

01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:06.180
those

01:53:06.180 --> 01:53:06.560
boots

01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:07.120
look pretty

01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:08.360
cool for

01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:08.840
somebody

01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:11.180
um

01:53:11.180 --> 01:53:15.180
you

01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:40.720
yes i

01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:40.820
don't

01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:41.240
understand

01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:41.580
the

01:53:41.580 --> 01:53:42.680
life

01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:43.240
boosting

01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:43.560
oil

01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:44.880
um

01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:52.000
it gives

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:52.460
you fast

01:53:52.460 --> 01:53:52.740
healing

01:53:52.740 --> 01:53:53.320
for a

01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:53.560
limited

01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:53.880
amount

01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:54.320
of time

01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:54.840

i just

01:53:55.660 --> 01:53:55.860
don't

01:53:55.860 --> 01:53:56.200
like it

01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:56.440
doesn't

01:53:56.440 --> 01:53:56.780

01:53:56.780 --> 01:53:57.140
how much

01:53:57.140 --> 01:53:57.580
you heal

01:53:57.580 --> 01:53:57.940
or what

01:53:57.940 --> 01:53:58.140
that

01:53:58.140 --> 01:53:58.620
what that

01:53:58.620 --> 01:53:59.000
means

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.620
it says

01:54:01.620 --> 01:54:02.020
fast

01:54:02.020 --> 01:54:02.340
healing

01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:02.780
three

01:54:02.780 --> 01:54:03.860
so

01:54:03.860 --> 01:54:05.000
that's

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:05.560
three hit

01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:05.940
points

01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:07.240
you regain

01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:07.720
for

01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:08.040
round

01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:08.880
every round

01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:09.080
for

01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:10.160
four rounds

01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:10.640
or whatever

01:54:10.640 --> 01:54:11.480
for four

01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:11.920
rounds

01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:12.580
yeah

01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:13.300
so a total

01:54:13.300 --> 01:54:13.740
of twelve

01:54:13.740 --> 01:54:14.360
hit points

01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:16.540
yeah

01:54:16.540 --> 01:54:19.640
hmm

01:54:19.640 --> 01:54:24.640
hmm

01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:26.640
hmm

01:54:26.640 --> 01:54:38.640
hmm

01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:40.640
um

01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:42.920
a little

01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:43.220
healing

01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:43.520
wouldn't

01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:43.940
be a bad

01:54:43.940 --> 01:54:44.280
idea

01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:45.220
um

01:54:45.220 --> 01:54:45.580
i don't

01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:45.820
know

01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:46.260
what

01:54:46.260 --> 01:54:47.260
we have

01:54:47.260 --> 01:54:47.460
for

01:54:47.460 --> 01:54:49.300
um

01:54:49.300 --> 01:54:49.940
what

01:54:49.940 --> 01:54:50.460
how long

01:54:50.460 --> 01:54:50.940
it takes

01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:51.640
to do

01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:52.720
any of

01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:53.100
that sort

01:54:53.100 --> 01:54:53.420
of thing

01:54:53.420 --> 01:54:53.640
but

01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:54.300
ten minutes

01:54:54.300 --> 01:54:56.160
ten minutes

01:54:56.160 --> 01:54:56.520
per

01:54:56.520 --> 01:54:57.320
action

01:54:57.320 --> 01:54:57.900
okay

01:54:57.900 --> 01:54:58.320
so

01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:01.320
the long

01:55:01.320 --> 01:55:01.960
the longer

01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:02.360
you wait

01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:02.740
the more

01:55:02.740 --> 01:55:03.080
likely

01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:03.400
there's

01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:03.620
something

01:55:03.620 --> 01:55:03.880
that's

01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:04.160
going to

01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:04.520
drop

01:55:04.520 --> 01:55:04.900
on your

01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:05.240
head

01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:06.160
so

can i

01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:09.120
medicine

01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:09.800
myself

01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:10.480
um

01:55:10.480 --> 01:55:14.720

spend a lot

01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:44.460
of time

01:57:44.460 --> 01:57:45.520
which may be

01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:46.320
more important

01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:46.900
for now

01:57:46.900 --> 01:57:48.240
um so i

01:57:58.580 --> 01:57:59.820
um

01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:01.140
and it

01:58:01.140 --> 01:58:01.880
only takes

01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:02.940
a round

01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:03.480
to do

01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:04.160
that so

01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:04.800
it's not

01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:05.180
gonna take

01:58:05.180 --> 01:58:05.800
us time

01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:07.380
yep

01:58:07.380 --> 01:58:08.700
if you do

01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:09.420
have potions

01:58:09.420 --> 01:58:10.280
this would

01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:10.800
also be an

01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:11.500
opportunity to

01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:12.120
use those

01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:12.720
as well

01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:13.320

02:03:19.500 --> 02:03:22.320
these guys are

02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:23.140
all all for

02:03:23.140 --> 02:03:23.320
it

02:03:23.320 --> 02:03:26.620

you you've

02:03:27.660 --> 02:03:28.240
been able to

avoid you've

02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:30.240
been able to

02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:30.820
avoid them

02:03:30.820 --> 02:03:32.400
um and

02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:33.160
keep and

02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:34.260
keep the uh

02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:34.940
the dwarves

02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:36.080
safe you are

02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:36.840
slowed down a

02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:37.320
little bit by

02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:38.120
that one dwarf

02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:39.280
that that was

02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:41.040
really severely

02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:42.360
um mauled

02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:43.540
but um you're

02:03:43.540 --> 02:03:43.960
still making

02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:44.720
good progress

02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:48.860
um and that

02:03:48.860 --> 02:03:49.920
gets us through

02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:50.700
the rest of

02:03:50.700 --> 02:03:51.140
the day

02:03:51.140 --> 02:03:52.520
um so

02:03:52.520 --> 02:03:54.060
we are

02:03:54.060 --> 02:03:55.400
approaching the

02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:55.920
evening

you know

02:03:56.520 --> 02:03:57.200

02:03:57.200 --> 02:03:57.840
group is

02:03:57.840 --> 02:03:58.720
feeling

02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:00.060
is a

02:04:00.060 --> 02:04:00.600
little bit

02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:01.160
uh a little

02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:01.660
bit more

02:04:01.660 --> 02:04:02.460
worse for

02:04:02.460 --> 02:04:02.740
wear

02:04:02.740 --> 02:04:04.140
at after

become one

we're good

02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:27.440
yeah

02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:28.780
yeah why

02:08:28.780 --> 02:08:28.940
are you

02:08:28.940 --> 02:08:29.220
trying to

02:08:29.220 --> 02:08:29.540
get other

02:08:29.540 --> 02:08:30.000
people to

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:30.720
roll society

02:08:30.720 --> 02:08:31.020
man

02:08:31.020 --> 02:08:31.700
you know

02:08:31.700 --> 02:08:32.660
honestly because

02:08:32.660 --> 02:08:33.220
i didn't

02:08:33.220 --> 02:08:33.640
i couldn't

02:08:33.640 --> 02:08:34.140
find it

02:08:34.140 --> 02:08:34.500
and i

02:08:34.500 --> 02:08:34.960
didn't realize

02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:35.320
that that

02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:35.760
screen

02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:36.740
um

02:08:36.740 --> 02:08:37.340
scrolled

02:08:37.340 --> 02:08:37.680
down

02:08:37.680 --> 02:08:38.360
and so i

02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:38.720
saw a

02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:38.860
roll

02:08:38.860 --> 02:08:39.280
knowledge

02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:39.580
but i

02:08:39.580 --> 02:08:39.800
thought it

02:08:39.800 --> 02:08:40.080
was under

02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:40.580
religion

02:08:40.580 --> 02:08:42.240
um

02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:42.600
and so

02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:42.840
then when

02:08:42.840 --> 02:08:43.280
i scrolled

02:08:43.280 --> 02:08:43.620
down and

02:08:43.620 --> 02:08:44.000
found the

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:44.540
society

02:08:44.540 --> 02:08:45.520
then i'm

02:08:45.520 --> 02:08:45.820
like oh

02:08:45.820 --> 02:08:46.120
well that

02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:46.560
makes sense

02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:46.860
i should

02:08:46.860 --> 02:08:47.240
do that

02:08:47.240 --> 02:08:47.840
so i

02:08:47.840 --> 02:08:48.300
found it

02:08:48.300 --> 02:08:49.280
all right

02:08:49.280 --> 02:08:50.340
well you

02:08:50.340 --> 02:08:50.960
know that's

02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:51.660
you know that

02:08:51.660 --> 02:08:52.600
cyclopses have

02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:53.080
low light

02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:53.640
vision but

02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:54.320
not not

02:08:54.320 --> 02:08:55.080
dark vision

02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:57.280
so they can

02:08:57.280 --> 02:08:58.100
see okay

02:08:58.100 --> 02:09:01.160
not great

02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:02.240
all right

02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:04.760
um

02:09:04.760 --> 02:09:07.320
if we were

02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:07.860
in a cave

02:09:07.860 --> 02:09:08.340
it'd be all

02:09:08.340 --> 02:09:09.200
right but

02:09:10.580 --> 02:09:11.740
however you

02:09:11.740 --> 02:09:12.640
do also

02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:14.700
know that

02:09:14.700 --> 02:09:15.260
um

02:09:15.260 --> 02:09:17.360
and i'll

02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:17.740
just give

02:09:17.740 --> 02:09:18.100
this one

02:09:18.100 --> 02:09:18.680
to you but

02:09:18.680 --> 02:09:19.300
spiders

02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:20.380
have dark

02:09:20.380 --> 02:09:20.880
vision are

02:09:20.880 --> 02:09:21.700
pretty good

02:09:21.700 --> 02:09:22.040
in dark

02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:22.520
places

02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:22.840
right

02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:24.300
yeah

02:09:24.300 --> 02:09:27.120
so the

02:09:27.120 --> 02:09:27.680
cyclops you

02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:28.300
might not be

02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:28.860
as worried

02:09:28.860 --> 02:09:29.340
about but

02:09:29.340 --> 02:09:29.980
the spider

02:09:29.980 --> 02:09:30.280
definitely

02:09:30.280 --> 02:09:31.200
and again

02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:31.860
the cyclops

02:09:31.860 --> 02:09:32.080
would be

02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:32.440
something i

02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:32.680
wouldn't be

02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:33.140
worried about

02:09:33.140 --> 02:09:33.560
if we were

02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:34.220
in a cave

02:09:34.220 --> 02:09:35.840
but we're

02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:36.320
not we're

02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:36.920
out we're

02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:38.320
outside that's

02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:39.760
almost daylight

02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:40.360
for him

02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:43.660
right so

02:09:43.660 --> 02:09:45.100
it's not

02:09:45.100 --> 02:09:46.600
yeah i'm

02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:47.260
i'm equally

02:09:47.260 --> 02:09:47.840
worried about

02:09:47.840 --> 02:09:48.280
both

02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:51.160
right um

02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:52.160
so

02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:54.160
um

02:09:54.160 --> 02:09:59.860
hey

02:09:59.860 --> 02:10:01.300
where are

02:10:01.300 --> 02:10:01.560

02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:01.740
we

02:10:01.740 --> 02:10:02.100
faces

idea or

02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:14.740

02:10:14.740 --> 02:10:15.360
idea of

02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:16.240
where

02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:17.020
that

02:10:17.020 --> 02:10:18.860
cyclops

02:10:18.860 --> 02:10:19.960
and um

02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:21.760
spider

02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:22.780

that's the

02:11:08.100 --> 02:11:08.380
plan

02:11:08.380 --> 02:11:09.000
right well

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:09.540
i mean

02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:18.020
you are

02:11:18.020 --> 02:11:18.740
being hunted

02:11:18.740 --> 02:11:20.060
not

02:11:20.060 --> 02:11:20.820
you

02:11:20.820 --> 02:11:22.840
and

02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:24.000
that was

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:24.680
the first

02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:25.260
encounter

02:11:25.260 --> 02:11:25.820
that you

02:11:25.820 --> 02:11:26.440
just went

02:11:26.440 --> 02:11:27.120
up against

02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:27.680
oh yeah

02:11:27.680 --> 02:11:29.060

02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:31.300
that in

02:11:31.300 --> 02:11:31.780
mind as

02:11:31.780 --> 02:11:32.240
far as

02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:32.940
as far as

02:11:32.940 --> 02:11:33.620
power levels

02:11:33.620 --> 02:11:34.380
are concerned

02:11:34.380 --> 02:11:35.360
yeah

02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:38.940
i really

02:11:38.940 --> 02:11:39.380
think

02:11:39.380 --> 02:11:40.000
we don't

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:40.580
have a lot

02:11:40.580 --> 02:11:41.580
about to

02:11:41.580 --> 02:11:41.840
press

02:11:41.840 --> 02:11:42.140
through

02:11:42.140 --> 02:11:42.380
the

02:11:42.380 --> 02:11:42.640
night

02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:43.200
again

02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:43.640
okay

02:11:43.640 --> 02:11:44.460
uh

green button, you click that, that will remove the thousand XP and add, or it'll subtract

02:20:20.920 --> 02:20:23.420
a thousand XP and convert you to the next level.

02:20:24.260 --> 02:20:25.060
Gotcha, okay.

02:20:25.060 --> 02:20:29.060
Yeah, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

02:20:29.060 --> 02:20:32.060
Oh, let's leave my chat window back.

02:20:32.060 --> 02:20:39.060
See, last time I just set my level and that messed up something, the XP I think.

02:20:39.060 --> 02:20:45.060
Yeah, I think you didn't, I think your XP didn't zero out at that point, but.

02:20:45.060 --> 02:20:47.060
Boop, add.

02:20:48.060 --> 02:20:49.980
All right, sick, we got level five.

02:20:50.880 --> 02:20:51.320
Yay.

02:20:52.340 --> 02:20:57.000
All right, cool, I will likely figure out what that means later, but I'm going to get an

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:58.220
ancestry feat.

02:20:59.600 --> 02:20:59.960
Sorry.

02:21:00.180 --> 02:21:02.260
Oh, that's it, I don't have to choose anything else.

02:21:02.620 --> 02:21:02.840
Cool.

02:21:04.520 --> 02:21:05.320
Gates threshold?

02:21:05.320 --> 02:21:11.020
Uh, well, you do actually have to, this is actually a big one for you, you get your

02:21:11.020 --> 02:21:12.180
attribute boosts.

02:21:12.400 --> 02:21:13.620
Yeah, this is the attribute level.

02:21:13.860 --> 02:21:14.940
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:21:15.180 --> 02:21:15.620
Sick.

02:21:16.980 --> 02:21:17.460
Um.

02:21:17.540 --> 02:21:17.880
Okay.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:24.040
I clicked a button and it says, hey, Gates threshold, select a Gates threshold.

02:21:24.200 --> 02:21:24.700
What the heck?

02:21:25.860 --> 02:21:26.900
How do I know what's what?

02:21:27.240 --> 02:21:28.060
I see an option.

02:21:32.860 --> 02:21:35.220
I'm going to come back to this and finish this up later.

02:21:35.320 --> 02:21:36.960
I'm going to hide it off for the night.

02:21:37.340 --> 02:21:37.500
Yeah.

02:21:37.620 --> 02:21:38.240
Thank you, Chris.

02:21:38.460 --> 02:21:39.200
Thank you, guys.

02:21:40.200 --> 02:21:40.460
Yep.

02:21:40.580 --> 02:21:40.740
Yep.

02:21:40.740 --> 02:21:42.060
We'll see you all next time.

02:21:42.980 --> 02:21:43.500
Have a good night.

02:21:43.560 --> 02:21:44.320
We'll see you, Ramsey.

02:21:45.040 --> 02:21:45.280
Yep.

02:22:01.960 --> 02:22:05.080
All right, guys, I am going to have to.

02:22:05.320 --> 02:22:14.000
Skip out as well, Jason, but we can definitely come back around and figure out your leveling

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:19.740
situation between this time and next time, if that's okay.

02:22:20.500 --> 02:22:20.700
Yep.

02:22:21.600 --> 02:22:21.920
Yep.

02:22:21.920 --> 02:22:22.160
Yep.

02:22:24.400 --> 02:22:25.700
So have a good night, dude.

02:22:27.440 --> 02:22:27.880
Awesome.

02:22:28.480 --> 02:22:28.820
Yeah.

02:22:29.180 --> 02:22:29.880
You as well.

02:22:30.600 --> 02:22:33.520
Hope everything's, hope everything's good on your end.

02:22:33.520 --> 02:22:34.860
Yeah, things are going pretty good.

02:22:34.860 --> 02:22:35.160
Yeah.

02:22:35.160 --> 02:23:05.140
Thank you.
