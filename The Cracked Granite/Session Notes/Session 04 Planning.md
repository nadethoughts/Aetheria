## 🗺️ Scene 1: The Escape Begins

**Setup:**  
The party has just freed the dwarven captives. They are exhausted, under-equipped, and not ready for travel. The ogres are enraged and have dispatched three elite hunting parties.

**Challenge:**  
The party must lead the refugees through rough terrain while avoiding detection.

## 🎬 Boxed Text: Opening Scene

> **The wind bites as you crest the ridge, the last rays of sun bleeding across the jagged horizon. Behind you, the ogre warcamp burns—its rituals disrupted, its prisoners freed. Twenty-one dwarves huddle close, wounded, weary, and unready for the journey ahead.**
> 
> **Kael Ironmark limps beside you, his voice low.**  
> _“They’ll come for us. Ogres don’t forget. And they don’t forgive.”_
> 
> **Far below, the mountains stretch like broken teeth. Somewhere out there lies safety—a fortified outpost, a dwarven watchtower. But between here and there, the hunters have already been unleashed.**

## 🧭 Skill Challenge: Mountain Flight

**Goal:** Escort the refugees to the fortified outpost without being intercepted.

**Success Threshold:** 4 successes before 3 failures  
**DC Range:** 17–19 (Level 4 standard)

### ❌ Failure Consequences

#### ❌ First Failure: The Ogre Werewolf Finds the Trail
![[Ogre-Werewolf.jpg]]
- The party must choose: fight or split the group and risk losing refugees.
- If they fight, they face the **Ogre Werewolf and his wolf pack** (see encounter below).
- If they flee, 1d4 refugees are lost to the wolves unless a PC sacrifices speed or safety.

### 🐺 Ogre Werewolf & Wolf Pack

> **The wind shifts—and with it, the scent of blood. A guttural howl splits the dusk. From the treeline, an ogre-shaped figure lopes forward, its body twisted by lycanthropy. Around him, wolves snarl and circle.**
> 
> **Kael growls.**  
> _“That’s no ordinary ogre. That’s Gorvok’s beast. He hunts for sport.”_

#### ❌ Second Failure: The Cyclops and Ofre Spider Ambush
### 🕷️ Cyclops & Ofre Spider

> **The canyon narrows. Shadows stretch long across the stone. A single eye gleams from the cliff above—a cyclops, massive and silent. Below, the ground trembles. A spider the size of a cart skitters from a crevice, its legs clicking like blades.**
> 
> **Webs glisten. Poison drips. The trap has been sprung.**

- The party is forced into a narrow canyon.
- The **Cyclops and Ofre Spider** attack from above and below.
- If they flee, the spider webs slow them—PCs must make Acrobatics DC 17 or be entangled.
- 1d6 refugees are poisoned unless the party wins or uses healing resources.

#### ❌ Third Failure: The Flame Drake Descends
### 🔥 Flame Drake

> **The sky roars. A streak of fire arcs overhead, wings outstretched. The Flame Drake descends, its scales glowing like molten steel. It lands with a hiss, the ground cracking beneath its claws.**
> 
> **Its breath ignites the air. The cliffside becomes a furnace.**

- The Flame Drake finds them on an exposed cliff.
- If they fight, the terrain is unstable—Reflex DC 17 or fall prone.
- If they flee, the drake sets fire to the path behind them.
- 1d4 refugees suffer fire damage unless protected.

#### ❌ Fourth Failure (if allowed): The Outpost is overwhelmed

- The party must abandon the refugees or be captured.
- If they choose to fight, it becomes a siege-style encounter with waves of enemies.
- If they flee, they lose 2d6 refugees and suffer a morale penalty in Ironhold.
## 🏰 Boxed Text: Failed Arrival at the Watchtower
![[Dwarven Watchtower.png]]
> **The mountain pass opens into a wide clearing, and for a moment, hope flickers. The watchtower stands ahead—its stone walls scorched, its banners torn. Smoke curls from the shattered gate. The silence is deafening.**
> 
> **Bodies lie scattered across the courtyard—soldiers, refugees, ogres. The ground is blackened with fire and blood. The outpost has fallen.**
> 
> **Kael Ironmark stares in disbelief.**  
> _“We were too late.”_
> 
> **A guttural roar echoes from the cliffs behind you. The hunt is not over. The ogres are closing in—and now, there is no safe haven.**

---

## 🧨 Consequences of Failure

If the party fails to reach the watchtower in time:

- **No Reinforcements:** The party cannot rely on military aid or shelter. They must continue the journey with 21 exhausted refugees.
- **Morale Loss:** The refugees are shaken. PCs must make Diplomacy or Performance checks (DC 17) to prevent panic or desertion.
- **Resource Drain:** The party loses access to healing, supplies, and rest. All consumables must be rationed.
- **Increased Pursuit:** The hunters are emboldened. One additional encounter is triggered (e.g., a second Flame Drake or ogre reinforcements).
- **Political Fallout:** When the party reaches Ironhold, Varric uses the fall of the watchtower to discredit them—claiming they led the refugees into danger.

## 🏰 Scene 3: The Fortified Outpost
> **Stone walls rise from the mist, carved into the mountain’s edge. Dwarven banners flutter in the wind. A watchtower stands tall, its guards already moving to meet you.**
> 
> **The refugees collapse in relief. Kael salutes the commander.**  
> _“We need to get word to Ironhold. The giants are coming.”_

**Setup:**  
If the party succeeds in the skill challenge or survives all three encounters, they reach a dwarven outpost—an old watchtower manned by 12 soldiers.

**Roleplay Hooks:**

- The refugees are given shelter and medical aid.
- The party can send a message to Ironhold via courier or magical means.
- The outpost commander is skeptical but loyal to the king.

## 👑 Scene 4: Return to Ironhold
![[Ironhold.png]]
**Setup:**  
The party returns to Ironhold with survivors and evidence. They are granted an audience with King Hargrin Deepmantle.

**Conflict:**  
Varric Silvervein is present and attempts to discredit the party.

## 👑 Scene: Return to Ironhold

> **The gates of Ironhold loom ahead, carved with runes older than memory. Inside, the halls buzz with tension. You are summoned to the king’s chamber.**
> 
> **King Hargrin Deepmantle sits in silence. Varric Silvervein stands beside him, arms crossed, voice sharp.**  
> _“Giants? Elemental rituals? This sounds like the ramblings of frightened miners.”_
