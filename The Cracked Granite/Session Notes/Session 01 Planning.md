### **Scene 1: The Secret Council**

**Purpose:**  
Set the tone, introduce the political landscape, and give the party their mission.

**Boxed Text (Read Aloud):**

> Deep in the heart of the Northern [[Stonefang Mountains]], in the fortress of [[Ironhold]], you a champion amoung the dwarves, have been summoned...
>
> The summons comes quietly—no fanfare, no banners, just a sealed scroll and a time. You are led through the quieter halls of [[Ironhold]], past forges and council chambers, into a part of the mountain few ever see. The stone here is older, darker, carved with runes that predate the current age.
> 
> In a private chamber, [[Hargrin Deepmantle]] waits, surrounded by a handful of trusted advisors. His expression is grim.

**NPCs Present:**

- [[Hargrin Deepmantle]] (quest giver, cautious, respected)
- [[Baelgrin Deepdelve]] (quiet scholar, hints at ancient threats)
- [[Bramli Stoneguard]] (loyal captain, wary of political corruption)
- [[Varric Silvervein]] (ambitious, subtly undermining)
- [[Maela Blackshard]] (spy, manipulator)

- Dagger's Sheath - A Dwarven Colony to the south of the [[Stonefang Mountains]]
	- Appears to have gone silent
	- Not sure what has happened, but don't want to cause alarm. It is hard enough to work with the [[Isolationists]] when things are going well.
-  Investigate what happened. Maybe they are just so busy that they lost track of time...

**Roleplay Tips:**

- Let each advisor give a brief, in-character comment or question.
- Varric and Maela should subtly sow doubt (“Perhaps the colony simply failed, my king. Why risk more lives?”).
- Loyalists (Bramli, Baelgrin) support the king and encourage action.
- Allow players to ask questions, share their past deeds, or express their views.

**Skill Checks:**

- **Society or Diplomacy**: Read the room, sense political tension.
- **Perception**: Notice Maela’s subtle manipulations or Kelda’s cryptic glances.
- **Lore (Ironhold)**: Recall details about Dagger’s Sheath or the political climate.

### **Scene 2: Arrival at Dagger’s Sheath**

**Purpose:**  
Transition to exploration and investigation, set a somber, mysterious tone.

**Boxed Text (Read Aloud):**

> After a week and a half of travel through mountain passes and silent valleys, you crest the final ridge. Below, the colony of Dagger’s Sheath lies in ruins—buildings shattered, stonework scorched, and no signs of life. The air is thick with ash and silence. The only sounds are the wind and the creak of broken timber.

**What the PCs Find:**

- No survivors, only wreckage and eerie silence.
- Giant-sized footprints in the mud and dust.
- Defaced dwarven banners, a broken royal seal, and strange runes burned into the earth.
- Evidence of a siege: collapsed barricades, shattered weapons, scorch marks.

**Exploration/Skill Challenges:**

- **Survival**: Track movement, identify giant footprints.
- **Arcana or Religion**: Interpret corrupted runes.
- **Perception**: Spot hidden clues (e.g., a half-buried message tube, signs of ritual activity).
- **Crafting or Engineering**: Assess how the defenses failed.

**Roleplay/Creative Hooks:**

- Let the creative/roleplay-focused player describe how their character investigates or memorializes the dead.
- The exploration-focused player can find a hidden clue or secret passage.
- The combat-focused player may notice signs of a recent struggle or prepare for danger.

### **Scene 3: There Was a Fire Fight!!!**

## **Purpose:**  
- 2 Combat Encounters
	- 2 Cinder Rats outside of the Caves
	- 2 Ogres with an Azer coming out of the caves

**Boxed Text (Read Aloud):**

> As you sift through the ruins, a faint sound echoes from the direction of the mines, You hear a monstrous skittering noise. 

> As the adrenalin begins to lower and you start to start to recover from the combat, you hear something coming from the mines—voices, guttural and harsh, not dwarven. Suddenly, the ground trembles and they are getting closer

> "I not know where it go. This cave too small."
> "Yeah, why stumpies make things so small"
> "Quite fools, Your master and mine will not be pleased unless we find the creature. We need to  find a different exit."
 

> You see two hulking ogres emerge, their skin marked with crude runes. Between them, an odd, orange-glowing dwarf-like creature—its eyes burning with elemental fire. They appear to be having a headed debate.


**Combat Encounter:**

- **Enemies:** 2 Ogres (brutes), 1 Azer (fire dwarf elemental)
- **Tactics:** Ogres charge and smash, Azer uses fire bursts and tries to set the terrain alight.
- **Environmental Hazards:**
    - Burning rubble (entering or ending turn = 1d6 fire damage, DC 15 Reflex to avoid)
    - Unstable ground (Acrobatics or Reflex save to avoid falling prone)
    - Collapsing structures (triggered by missed attacks or area effects)

**Skill/Creative Opportunities:**

- **Athletics**: Climb rubble for high ground.
- **Nature/Arcana**: Identify the Azer and its weaknesses.
- **Crafting**: Use debris as improvised cover or weapons.
- **Roleplay**: Shout warnings, rally allies, or try to intimidate the ogres.

**Optional Discovery:**

- During or after the fight, the party finds **Captain Kaela Ironmark** hiding, wounded but alive. She can give tactical insight (“They knew our defenses. Someone told them how to break us.”) and hint at betrayal.

### **Session Pacing & Player Engagement**

- **Roleplay:** Scene 1 (council) and Kaela’s rescue.
- **Exploration:** Scene 2 (ruins investigation).
- **Combat:** Scene 3 (ogres + Azer, with hazards).

**Tips:**

- Let each player shine in their preferred style at least once.
- Use boxed text to set the mood, then open up for player-driven action.
- If time is tight, keep the investigation focused and the combat brisk—use environmental hazards to add tension without dragging out the fight.
