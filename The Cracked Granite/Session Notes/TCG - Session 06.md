Here’s what happened in Session 06 of _The Cracked Granite_:

- The party traveled from Hammergate Hold, having been hunted by ogre parties. They previously survived encounters with werewolves, wolves, a cyclops, and a giant spider while escorting 21 dwarven refugees.
- At Hammergate Hold, Captain Thrain Emberhelm received their report and put the watchtower on red alert, sending messages to other watchtowers. He asked the party to investigate Sentinel’s Rise, which had gone silent.
- At Sentinel’s Rise, the party found the watchtower destroyed, with troll footprints and some unknown, heavy furred creature tracks. They also found a lockdown order from Grand Regent Varric Silvervein, instructing the tower to barricade and not respond to messages.
- The party reported their findings to Hammergate Hold via sending stone and were urged to reach Ironhold quickly, as an ogre army was on the march.
- On their way to Ironhold, the party passed the ancient dwarven Rings of Coram and noticed recent activity and arcane light emanating from the monument.
- Investigating the Rings of Coram, they found a cave giant performing a ritual, transforming weakened trolls into elementally empowered trolls (Forest, Ice, Rock, etc.), each at a different cardinal gate glowing with colored light.
- The party identified the cave giant and the trolls, realized the ritual was empowering the trolls rather than summoning new ones, and debated whether to disrupt the ritual, attack, or sneak away.
- They chose to engage, attacking the trolls and the cave giant. The battle began with the party using their specialized weapons and abilities, targeting the trolls at the gates and the giant in the center.
- The fight was intense, with trolls stepping into gates and emerging transformed, and the cave giant continuing its ritual. The party used tactics like stealth, ranged attacks, and elemental blasts.
- The session ended mid-battle, with the cave giant and empowered trolls still posing a threat.

**Key unresolved threads:**

- The fate of Sentinel’s Rise and Captain Ironbrow
- The true purpose and power of the Rings of Coram
- The cave giant’s ritual and the threat of empowered trolls
- The ogre army’s advance and the party’s urgent mission to reach Ironhold
