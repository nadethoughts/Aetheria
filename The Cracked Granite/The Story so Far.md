# 🛡️ Session 01 – The Cracked Granite

Deep beneath the Stonefang Mountains, the halls of Ironhold echoed with quiet urgency. Three dwarves—Rurik Embercloak, Hurgan Ironmark, and Demlor Ironmark—were summoned without fanfare, each handed a sealed scroll and led through ancient corridors to a rune-carved chamber few had ever seen.

There, King Hargrin Deepmantle awaited, flanked by his trusted advisors: Baelgrin Deepdelve, Bramli Stoneguard, Varric Silvervein, and Maela Blackshard. The king’s words were grave—the southern colony of Dagger’s Sheath had gone silent. No word in over a month. Sending an army would risk political upheaval, so he turned to his champions: dwarves whose deeds had earned respect beyond clan and council.

Before their departure, Bramli Stoneguard pulled the trio aside. His warning was quiet but dire: the king’s council was compromised. Danger lurked not only in the south, but within Ironhold’s own walls.

The dwarves departed at midnight, slipping through the city’s shadows. Rurik paused at The Forge’s Fire for one last meal, leaving a soap-carved dwarf on the table—a silent promise to return. They rode sturdy goats through silent valleys and frostbitten passes, the world growing colder and quieter with each mile.

At last, they crested the final ridge. Dagger’s Sheath lay in ruins—buildings shattered, stonework scorched, banners defaced, and the royal seal broken. Giant-sized footprints marked the earth, runes burned deep into the ground. Dwarves lay crushed in their armor, others torn apart by unimaginable force.

Demlor, shaken, recognized the signs: giants. Thought extinct for over a thousand years, their return defied all dwarven history.

Smoke rose from the quarry. Skittering echoed from the mines. The trio crept forward, weapons ready, and faced their first challenge—Cinder Rats, elemental creatures of fire and molten stone. Rurik’s cold-forged ammunition tore through the beasts. Demlor summoned blades of metal from thin air. Hurgan’s twin axes struck with relentless precision.

The rats were defeated, but not without cost. Burns lingered, fire clung to their wounds, and the air grew heavy with dread.

As they caught their breath, voices echoed from the darkness:

> “I not know where it go. This cave too small.” “Yeah, why stumpies make things so small?” “Quiet fools. Your master and mine will not be pleased unless we find the creature.”

Two ogres emerged, their skin etched with crude runes. Between them walked an Azer—a dwarf-shaped elemental glowing with fire.

The party hadn’t been seen.

Yet.

**XP Awarded:**

- 500 XP for accepting the mission, traveling, investigating the ruins, and defeating the Cinder Rats.

# 🛡️ Session 02 – The Cracked Granite

The dwarves pressed deeper into the mines of Dagger’s Sheath, following the trail of destruction left by ogres and stranger foes. Within the darkness, they faced a fierce battle: two ogres and a fiery elemental smith—an Azer—emerged, searching for a missing dwarf. The party struck first, using tactics and teamwork to bring down the brutes and their elemental ally.

After the dust settled, the dwarves searched the ruined mine, finding evidence of a desperate last stand. Among the rubble, Demlor and Hurgan uncovered a survivor: Captain Kael Ironmark, battered but alive. With the mine collapsing around them, the party raced against time, dodging traps and debris to escape with Kael.

Outside, Kael revealed grim news. The giants—thought extinct—had returned, attacking with ogres and elemental thralls. Survivors from Dagger’s Sheath were being held captive in an ogre war camp to the west, guarded by both ogres and elementals. Kael provided a map of the area and marked a safe place to meet later.

The party tended wounds, gathered what supplies they could, and set out to scout the enemy camp. From a hidden vantage, they saw cages of dwarven prisoners, guarded tents, siege weapons, and patrols of ogres, Azers, and mud elementals. The dwarves prepared to infiltrate the camp, rescue their kin, and uncover the truth behind the giants’ return.

**XP Awarded:**

- 500 XP for defeating the ogres and Azer, rescuing Kael Ironmark, and scouting the war camp.
- The party advances to level 4.

# 🛡️ Session 03 – The Cracked Granite

Night cloaked the ogre war camp as the dwarves prepared their boldest gambit yet. Hurgan, mountain-born and keen-eyed, traced a perilous route along the cliff’s edge, guiding his companions through shadow and stone. The camp below seethed with ogres, elemental thralls, and the ominous glow of arcane rituals.

Slipping into the chaos, Rurik Embercloak became a ghost among giants. He crept to the edge of the command tent, snatched battle maps and secret missives from the war table, and left behind a marble—a silent mark of dwarven honor. Then, with a grin and a spark, Rurik unleashed a storm: black powder ignited, flames roaring skyward, scattering ogres and sowing confusion.

Inside the tent, Demlor Ironmark called upon the mountain’s power. From the edge of the tent, he reached out with magnetic force, drawing a pile of dwarven weapons and armor—loot taken from the fallen—toward himself. But the female ogre performing a dark ritual spotted him, and violence erupted. Demlor fought her in the heart of the tent, steel and elemental fury clashing amid the chaos. In the struggle, Demlor shattered the chains binding a captive dwarf, freeing him from the ritual’s grip and the brink of elemental corruption.

With the camp in chaos—ogres scrambling, tents ablaze—the trio raced to the cages where twenty dwarven survivors awaited rescue. Hurgan led the assault, dispatching the remaining guards with ruthless precision, while Demlor finished off the last foe. The dwarves outfitted their kin with reclaimed gear, scaled the cliffs, and vanished into the night, tracks covered and hearts racing.

Reunited with Captain Kael Ironmark, the dwarves learned the grim truth: many captives had been transformed into elemental thralls, their wills bent to the giants’ cause. Armed with stolen intelligence, rescued kin, and the knowledge of a new, elemental threat, the heroes turned toward Ironhold—ready to warn the king and face whatever darkness awaited.

**XP Awarded:**

- 500 XP for infiltrating the camp, rescuing the dwarves, and escaping with vital intelligence.

# 🛡️ Session 04 – The Cracked Granite

With the ogre warcamp in flames behind them, the dwarves fled into the mountains, guiding twenty-one rescued kin and the wounded Captain Kael Ironmark. Their destination: a dwarven watchtower two days away. But the ogres had loosed their hunters.

The journey became a desperate race. The party navigated treacherous terrain, shielding the refugees from pursuit. But the howls came—dire wolves and a monstrous ogre werewolf found their trail. In a brutal clash, the dwarves stood firm. The werewolf fell, and a refugee was pulled from death’s grip by Rurik’s steady hands.

They pressed on, evading a cyclops and its venomous spider companion, and a flame drake that scorched the skies. Through clever scouting and sheer grit, they avoided further bloodshed.

But as dawn broke on the second day, the mountains betrayed them. A misstep in the final stretch brought the cyclops and spider down upon them—just hours from safety. The session ended on a cliffhanger, the watchtower in sight, but danger closing fast.

**XP Awarded:**

- 500 XP for surviving the escape, defeating the werewolf, and protecting the refugees.
- The party advances to level 5.

**Key NPCs:**

- Kael Ironmark – Wounded, guiding the refugees.
- Gorvok – Ogre warcamp leader (not encountered directly).
- 21 dwarven refugees – Rescued from the warcamp.

# 🛡️ Session 05 – The Cracked Granite

The dwarves pressed onward, guiding twenty-one rescued kin through frostbitten passes and ancient woods. The red drake that had hunted them circled above, its shadow a constant threat. But worse still waited in the trees.

At dawn, a cyclops crested a massive fallen redwood, its single eye gleaming with fury. Skittering behind it, a venomous ogre spider joined the ambush. Rurik’s rifle roared, Demlor summoned elemental fury, and Hurgan’s twin axes carved through the chaos. The cyclops fell to a precise strike, bleeding out on the forest floor. The spider met its end in a hail of bullets and steel.

The party gathered enchanted loot and pressed on. Hammergate Hold rose from the mist, its gates opening to receive the wounded. Captain Thrain Emberhelm greeted the party and listened as they recounted the destruction of Dagger’s Sheath and the strange magic wielded by their foes. Ogres, trolls, and elemental corruption—threats not seen in the mountains for centuries.

After a brief rest, Emberhelm revealed a troubling silence from Sentinel’s Rise, a nearby watchtower. Its last message, a lockdown order from Grand Regent Varric Silvervein, raised suspicions of betrayal. The party agreed to investigate.

On the way, they passed the ancient Rings of Coram, glowing faintly with recent activity. At Sentinel’s Rise, they found devastation: elemental magic, unconscious survivors, troll and unknown footprints, and orders from Varric himself. The party sent word back to Hammergate Hold and was urged to reach Ironhold.

As night fell, mysterious lights glowed at the Rings of Coram. The dwarves pressed on, knowing the fate of Ironhold—and all dwarvenkind—rested on their shoulders.

**XP Awarded:**

- 500 XP for defeating the cyclops and spider, reaching Hammergate Hold, and investigating Sentinel’s Rise.
