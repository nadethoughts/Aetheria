### 🪓 **Introduction – The Cracked Granite**

> _The Fourth Age is young, but already scarred._
> 
> A year has passed since the skies burned and the world changed. While kingdoms fell and empires fractured, the dwarves of Ironhold endured—sealed within their mountain halls, shielded by stone and tradition.
> 
> Now, the gates have opened.
> 
> Ironhold looks outward once more, seeking to reclaim its place in the world. The halls echo with the sounds of rebuilding, of reforging old alliances, and of preparing for what lies beyond the granite walls.
> 
> You are dwarves of renown—adventurers, soldiers, champions. Whether born of noble blood or hardened in the mines, your deeds have earned you respect. You are not bound by politics or clan feuds. You are trusted to act with strength, wisdom, and honor.
> 
> The world beyond the stone is uncertain. The future of Ironhold may rest in your hands.
> 
> Choose your path. Forge your legacy. And remember:
> 
> Stone may crack.
> 
> But it does not break easily.

# 📖 Session 01 – The Cracked Granite

In the deep halls of Ironhold, beneath the Stonefang Mountains, three dwarves were summoned without ceremony. Each received a sealed scroll and a time. No fanfare. No banners. Just quiet urgency. They were led through ancient corridors, past forges and council chambers, into a rune-carved chamber few had ever seen.

There, King Hargrin Deepmantle awaited, flanked by his trusted advisors: Baelgrin Deepdelve, the loyal scholar; Bramli Stoneguard, the silent captain; Varric Silvervein, the ambitious noble; and Maela Blackshard, the spymaster whose eyes missed nothing.

The king spoke plainly. The southern colony of Dagger’s Sheath had gone silent. No word in over a month. He could not send an army—doing so would give the Isolationists ammunition to halt his expansionist vision. Instead, he turned to three champions: Rurik Embercloak, Hurgan of the Ironmark Clan, and Demlor, a metal-wielding investigator also of the Ironmark Clan.

Each had earned his trust. Each had proven themselves in Ironhold’s darkest hours.

Before they departed, Bramli pulled them aside. His warning was quiet but grave: the king’s council was compromised. The danger might not lie only in the south.

## 🧙 The Dwarves

**Rurik Embercloak**, a gunslinger medic, once defeated an owlbear that breached the lower halls. Clanless by birth—his parents excommunicated priests of the Deep Shiver—he questioned the rigidity of dwarven religion but held tightly to the bonds of kinship. He had sworn an oath with Demlor: _“Stone unbroken, forge unquenched, together we endure.”_ Together with Hurgan, he had discovered a forgotten dwarven goddess and developed a flanking tactic that once stopped goblin saboteurs. He and Demlor had saved a platoon from an orc ambush, earning the king’s commendation.

**Hurgan**, a scout of the Ironmark Clan, had returned the Lost Key of his people to the temple archives. He quietly opposed the law that required firstborn sons to follow in their father’s footsteps—his own son bore a physical impairment, and Hurgan wanted him to choose his own path. He had taken a bolt for Demlor during a cave-in, and the two now bore matching tattoos. He had fought beside Demlor in the Battle of the Drunken Cave and shared in the discovery of the lost goddess with Rurik.

**Demlor**, a metal kineticist and investigator of the Ironmark Clan, had led an expedition into the Underdark, discovering a hidden route and hostile orcs. Though loyal to his clan, he believed those without lineage still deserved a voice in Ironhold’s future. He had fought beside both Rurik and Hurgan, saved lives, and earned honors. His mind was sharp, his will unyielding, and his power drawn from the very bones of the mountain.

## 🐐 The Journey

The trio departed at midnight to avoid prying eyes. Rurik stopped at his favorite tavern, _The Forge’s Fire_, for one last meal. As he left, he placed a soap-carved dwarf on the table and pocketed a shale coaster in return.

They rode goats through silent valleys and mountain passes. The journey took just under a week. The air grew colder. The land quieter.

## 🏚️ Dagger’s Sheath

They crested the final ridge and saw the ruins.

Dagger’s Sheath was gone.

Buildings lay shattered. Stonework scorched. No signs of life. The only sounds were wind and the creak of broken timber.

They found giant-sized footprints—each the length of a dwarf. Defaced banners. A broken royal seal. Runes burned into the earth. Dwarves crushed in their armor, as if by massive hands. Others torn apart.

Demlor, shaken, recognized the signs. Giants. Thought extinct for over a thousand years. Their return defied all dwarven history.

---

## 🔥 The Mines

Smoke rose from the quarry. Skittering echoed from the depths. The party crept forward and spotted them—Cinder Rats, elemental creatures of fire and molten stone.

Rurik’s cold-forged ammunition tore through them. Demlor summoned weapons of metal from thin air. Hurgan struck with axe and hammer, his twin takedown style relentless.

The rats were defeated, but not without cost. Burns lingered. Fire clung to their wounds.

## ⚔️ The Cliffhanger

As they caught their breath, voices echoed from the mines:

> “I not know where it go. This cave too small.”  
> “Yeah, why stumpies make things so small?”  
> “Quiet fools. Your master and mine will not be pleased unless we find the creature.”

Two ogres emerged, their skin etched with crude runes. Between them walked an Azer—a dwarf-shaped elemental glowing with fire.

They hadn’t seen the party.

Yet.

## 🛡️ Session 02 – The Cracked Granite

The dwarves pressed deeper into the mines of Dagger’s Sheath, following the trail of destruction left by ogres and stranger foes. Within the darkness, they faced a fierce battle: two ogres and a fiery elemental smith—an Azer—emerged, searching for a missing dwarf. The party struck first, using tactics and teamwork to bring down the brutes and their elemental ally.

After the dust settled, the dwarves searched the ruined mine, finding evidence of a desperate last stand. Among the rubble, Demlor and Hurgan uncovered a survivor: Captain Kael Ironmark, battered but alive. With the mine collapsing around them, the party raced against time, dodging traps and debris to escape with Kael.

Outside, Kael revealed grim news. The giants—thought extinct—had returned, attacking with ogres and elemental thralls. Survivors from Dagger’s Sheath were being held captive in an ogre war camp to the west, guarded by both ogres and elementals. Kael provided a map of the area and marked a safe place to meet later.

The party tended wounds, gathered what supplies they could, and set out to scout the enemy camp. From a hidden vantage, they saw cages of dwarven prisoners, guarded tents, siege weapons, and patrols of ogres, Azers, and mud elementals. The dwarves prepared to infiltrate the camp, rescue their kin, and uncover the truth behind the giants’ return.

**XP Awarded:**

- 500 XP for defeating the ogres and Azer, rescuing Kael Ironmark, and scouting the war camp.
- The party advances to level 4.
