## 🛡️ **Session 0 Introduction – The Cracked Granite**

When the [[Flaming Retribution]] scorched the surface world, the [[Dwarves]] did not burn. They sealed their gates, reinforced their halls, and endured. For a year, [[Ironhold]] remained silent—its people surviving by stone, steel, and stubborn will.

Now, the gates have opened.

[[Ironhold]] is a kingdom of clans. Each clan has its own traditions, its own strengths—miners, warriors, scholars, traders, mystics, scouts. Some dwarves are born into these clans. Others walk alone, clanless but not without purpose.

[[Hargrin Deepmantle]], believes the time has come to reclaim the surface. He has sent out colonies—small footholds in the wilds—to reestablish dwarven presence in the world. Not all agree.

Two factions now shape [[Ironhold]]’s future:

- **Isolationists** believe the surface is still cursed, and that [[Ironhold]] must remain sealed and self-sufficient.
- **Expansionists** believe the world is ripe for reclamation, and that [[Dwarves]] must rise again as builders and rulers.

Tensions simmer. Old grudges stir. And the fate of [[Ironhold]] may rest in the hands of those willing to walk beyond the granite walls.

You are [[Dwarves]] of renown—adventurers, soldiers, champions. You are not bound by politics, but you are trusted to act with strength, wisdom, and honor.

Before you choose your path, ask yourself:

- What clan do you hail from—or do you walk alone?
- What do you believe Ironhold should become?

The stone endures. But even stone can crack.

### 🎙️ **Session 1 Introduction – The King’s Call**

> _The halls of Ironhold are never truly silent. Even in the deepest chambers, the stone remembers footsteps, whispers, and war._

You are summoned to a sealed chamber beneath the throne room—one rarely used, and never without purpose. The guards at the door do not speak. The torches here burn low, casting long shadows across rune-carved walls.

You are heroes of [[Ironhold]]—your names spoken with respect in the forges, the barracks, and the ale halls. You’ve earned that honor through your deeds.

[[King Hargrin Deepmantle]] has called you here in secret, away from the eyes and ears of the council, for a purpose that will be revealed once your arrive.

You find yourself in the room with [[King Hargrin Deepmantle|King Hargrin]] and 4 of his trusted advisors 
- [[Baelgrin Deepdelve]] (the High Loremaster)
- [[Bramli Stoneguard]] (Captain of the Royal Guard)
- [[Kelda Deepshiver]] (Spy Master)
- [[Marnak Deepforge]] (Guild master of the [[Ironhold]] Miners' Consortium)
