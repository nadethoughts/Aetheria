Backstory

  

Arthur was born amid the grime and shadows of Old Penmaris, in the slums beneath the city’s proud sea walls. His mother, a laundress, and his father, a dockhand, both perished in a warehouse fire when jhe was still a cub. Left to fend for himself, Arthur survived on scraps, wit, and a stubborn belief that even in darkness, one must not become what devours the light.

  

Among the alleys and half-flooded docks, he found kinship with another orphan — a young kobold truescale named Kaelrix. Though their tempers clashed, the two became inseparable brothers. Together, they ran with the back-alley gangs of Penmaris, daring the guards and the world itself. Arthur’s stubborn fairness and Kaelrix’s cunning made them leaders among the forgotten.

  

But the bond would not last.

The Fracture

  

When Arthur was twelve, Kaelrix’s sorcerous bloodline awakened — flames kindling at his fingertips, power answering his every whim. At first, Arthur saw wonder in it. But Kaelrix’s gift soon curdled into cruelty. He began using magic to control others, ruling their small gang by fear. Arthur tried to stop him, but Kaelrix only sneered, calling him a fool chasing a dead world’s kindness.

  

Their final fight was brief and bitter. Arthur walked away bruised and alone — the last time he would ever see his brother as a friend.

The Priest’s Hand

  

A year later, Arthur collapsed beside the blackened ruin of a chapel — beaten, starving, and ready to surrender to the cold. There, Father Aldren Thane, a wandering priest of Serelle, found him. The old man looked upon the half-starved beastkin and saw not a gutter rat, but a spark of defiance still flickering.

  

Aldren took him in, over the objections of the watch and his own superiors. He taught Arthur to read, to work, to pray — and to believe that mercy was not weakness. Under Aldren’s care, Arthur’s claws grew steady. He learned the hymns of Serelle and the disciplines of Miraine, goddess of protection and passage. In time, he was sent to train as a squire of the faith.

  

He never forgot the gutter. Nor did he forget Kaelrix.

The Confrontation

  

At seventeen, newly anointed and proud in his first mail shirt, Arthur met Kaelrix again — now a ganglord wreathed in fire, ruling the ruins of the southern wharves. The meeting ended in violence: light against flame, conviction against fury. Arthur survived, barely, and the flames left scars that never quite faded.

  

Kaelrix escaped into the chaos of the slums, swearing that Arthur would one day see the world as he did — beyond redemption.

The Flaming Retribution

  

When Arthur was twenty-four, the Flaming Retribution struck. Fire fell from the heavens and the seas rose to claim the land. Old Penmaris was swallowed whole. Arthur and Father Aldren fought side by side through the burning streets, pulling survivors from the tide. Dozens lived because of them.

  

But not Aldren.

  

The priest’s final act was to press his trembling hand to Arthur’s shield and whisper:

“Be the light when all else burns away.”

  

When the storm passed, Arthur was left with the ashes of a city and the weight of a promise.
