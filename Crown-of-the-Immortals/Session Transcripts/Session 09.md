I'm gonna start this recording off. Ramsey, we miss you. Alright. Listen. So when last we met, you guys were continuing to move through the tunnels for the goblin players.

The goblins themselves were, you ran into a, a lake that had what looked like yeah. Here's his sister, on a what's happening there. Rock. So he jumped over. To set her free and was assailed by some goblinoid squid monsters.

He also discovered that his, his sister was, in fact, not his sister, but a hag of some variety. Oh, I bet she was a hag. But she also but she knew things about you that she shouldn't have known had she just been some random person. So illusion. The rest of the the rest of the party, stayed on the far shore and attacked from afar, and you were able to, you were able to, defeat the hag and the squid monsters.

You moved down the road or down the shoreline, I should say, of the, cave lake and found a, couple of different, passageways that were out, that were out of the cavern, a few different, areas. There were a couple that were heading west. There was one that was heading east. There was a cliff with a strange blue glow at the top of it, and you guys found a couple of goblin or a goblin and a goblin dog, that were on patrol moving rapidly in your general direction coming out of the tunnel to the east. Who then, moved in and dispatched the, the goblins, the goblin and the goblin dog.

And, then you saw a larger alcove a couple of larger alcoves further into the tunnel. Mhmm. With, with with a one of the alcoves specifically, had flickering light in it, which was unusual because up until this point, you had not seen anything that were even remotely resembled a, what, a torch light, you know, anything that was like man made light. You discovered that there were some additional goblins in that alcove, and ran into attacked them. You defeated all of the goblins as well as a dark skinned elf woman that was also in that alcove, and that was where we finished for the night.

Where you find yourself in in this alcove, it's slightly larger than an alcove. It's more of like a more of like a cave, area. You see along the walls, there are six sconces with porches on them. There at the far end of the, the far end of the cave, you see a giant statue. Yeah.

It's driving where we were last time. Right? Like, where we ended? Sorry. You ended.

Yep. Okay. That looks kind of like a cross between That's great definition. It's a well, it it's it's odd. I've never really seen seen a creature that really looks like any of this, but it does look a linoid.

It's a lot taller than a goblin. It's a it it's larger it's a larger scale, but it also doesn't look like it was even if it was scaled appropriately, that it would be the size of a goblin. It looks more along lines of of its proportions look more along the lines of the elf that you guys defeated. It's standing on a pedestal, and there are a number of mementos and or offerings that are at the feet of the pedestal here. And I will go ahead and pull you into the Nice.

Map so that you can get over there. So, so and and the, the floor itself is the is cleanest that you've seen any of the floors here. There are some mats, laying across the floor as well. This for lack of a better term, especially, Carson, you would you you'd be able to identify this as it seems like this is some sort of, some sort of chapel sort of situation. It seems to be set up like a chapel.

Yeah. So anything you wanna do while you're here? I would like to I mean, I'm not close to that statue. I'd I'd like to just look at it to see if there's any other types of markings or information that would be helpful. K.

Sounds like a perception check. And I cannot move my character because I'm kinda I'm gonna switch it. I'm gonna do that, and then K. Perception check coming up. There we go.

Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.

Nope. Oh, there we go. How about I use this one? Sorry. I'm trying to look for it in the wrong spot.

How come you didn't pop up? Oh, that's cool. Why do you shrink on me? Sorry. It shrunk.

Why don't you shrink? Don't shrink. There. Alright. I'll be I'll be right back.

I gotta go check on Julie. Alright. Chris, it's not popping up. There it is. Jeez.

Yeah. Here you go. Alright. Stupid fucking pain. K.

15. Okay. So you walk up to the, walk up to the weird altar. Yes. And there are a couple things that you notice.

You you notice that there's some iconography on the, on the base of the altar. I don't know what that is. Symbols. Oh, okay. There are there are symbols on on on the base of the altar.

You do also notice that there's a blood stained letter, that is basically kinda wedged to be a base and the foot of the statue. Like a letter letter? Like a letter letter. I will look at the letter letter. Alright.

Or I will go and reach and grab it if it looks safe. Sameer is going to, not use a healing potion because he already did, and it was worthless. So, he would, however, like to post himself, if he may, over in this kind of area here. It just offer a bit of a lookout while we're doing some exploration. Yeah.

Because we're in, like, a little alcove, right, or a cove. Like, you can't Right. We don't we don't see anything, like, you could get in and out. You're just kinda trapped here. Mhmm.

K. No problem. Yeah. So, Samira, go ahead and roll a perception to see if you can, find many people there. So Clark or, the letter as you pull it out is stained with blood, but, you are able to, basically, you pull it out and, open it up, and it's mostly intact.

There is, among among the writings in the letter, there is a paragraph that kind of jumps out at you. It says, the betrayer is diligent in his efforts from the ruins of Ulthar. His servant his servants, creatures of the dark, work relentlessly to restore him to power. His desire to change what is good evil and undermine the light of the blessed realm drives him. May Raythellion's light e reach even the dark places and Justicar's scales ever be balanced against this evil.

And I'm gonna go ahead and drop this letter into your Yeah. I'm a need that read again. I'm struggling to find so I can find in my skills Perception is not a skill. It's an attribute. Great.

I put it in there, and it gives me a perception under my initiative, but I don't really wanna roll that. Well, if you scroll down, even beyond that, there is a perception heading underneath your initiative. You just click on that. There's perception, then there's saves, and you just have to scroll through the attributes. It's not letting me scroll any further.

I think I'm in the same spot as you are in that little sidebar. Yeah. So in the sidebar, if you click on attributes Yep. It drops down a menu, and then there's the initiative perception. Then you, yeah, then you scroll down.

Okay. Yeah. Okay. I think my yeah. Okay.

I think I see what's happening. Okay. No adjustments to be made. Splendid. Six.

Okay. That's a six. Yeah. Straight on to your So you rolled an 11, for that. You are not see there there aren't any specific, I mean, you're you're keeping watch, but you don't really see anything that's specifically, like, coming out for that.

That's right. For, the blood stained letter, it's currently in Carson's inventory. So if you wanna go back and reread it, there it is. But I can read the passage. The passage says the betrayer is diligent in his efforts from the ruins of Kofilar.

His servants, teachers of the dark, work relentlessly to restore him to power, His desire to change what is good to evil and undermine the light of the blessed realms of the blessed realm drives him. May Ray Filion's light reach even to the darkest places and Jesticar's scales ever be balanced against this evil. Okay. So do we have we ever seen this particular or have I seen this particular kind of deity or statue or this group? So yeah.

So to identify the iconography, I'm gonna need a knowledge or a, religion check. To identify anything about this betrayer person, I'm gonna need an occult check. Okay. Okay. Well, let me do this.

Religion check. Oh, that's not bad. There we go. I I I did the never mind. I don't know why that's not working.

Some skills. Oh, no. Here we go. Come on. Alright.

I'm just rolling stuff. Okay. Okay. Here, funny enough. You you see the you see the symbols on the on the base of, on the base of the, pedestal, and those, and those symbols don't seem to match what you understand.

The the figure to be that figure doesn't doesn't sit, doesn't match the deity that those symbols are for. The deity itself is Erebos, who is the, who is the deity of darkness. The, basically, the the, or it's Erebos, the sovereign of shadows is is is actual title. He works against Raythellian, and the symbols themselves are basically, are basically, like, kind of like a sun that is being eaten by a number of crows. S.

D. D. Is known for, the domains of corruption, destruction, shadow. Oh, is that all? Yeah.

Just that. The the symbols themselves, the symbol the symbol themselves is basically a murder of fanged crows that are eclipsing the sun, and trying to devour it. And, you know, you know this as a rep this represents the encroaching darkness and the eternal hunger for power. So I just used the term murder of crows since hold on. Hold on.

I like it too. Yeah. Clarifying on the statue. So the statue doesn't fit the markings or the letter that we see? Yeah.

So Erebos is never really represented as a person. So it's kind of like, you know, it it's kind of like this it's kind of like this, you know, darkness that is surrounded by, you know, like, by a bunch of crows. So it's not like, there's a there's a personal representation. And, for all of, for all of Erebos' stuff, he is never once referred to as a betrayer. He's the he's the dark sovereign, or the sovereign of shadows, but he's never referred to as a betrayer.

So so there's there's a little bit of a there's a little bit of a thing that doesn't really kinda match up. It just kinda seems kinda odd. Clark, can Carson make an occultism check? Perfect. Just waiting.

Come on. Get good. If it's not high oh, I'm rerolling that. Let me let me I'm doing it. Is your hero point?

Yeah. Because I think this is important information. Oh. No. It's a lot better.

Alright. I think it is. So yeah. So you are aware of one figure that is referred to as a betrayer, and that person or it is a person, not a deity, is Vorath. Vorath is a, is a La Palouse.

He is one of the more famous La Palouse or some sorts that turned his back on the blessed realm, turned his back on Raythellian, and is, and is one of the reasons why La Palouse are looked with looked at with distrust, anger, and, and, generally hunted, by by some organizations. Right. And I and I would know that on the street. I would That's a statue. I'm sorry.

Right. So Horath was an elf, in in a in a previous, in was an elf, when he was raised as a sun sword. This is over a over a century ago that that this happened. Over time, he, was he, decided to move against Raythellian, and, was but while he was a lot while he was a lot flu, at the beginning, he was he was known for being, a excellent mediator. He would basically, be able to mediate and, and deescalate conflicts without needing to result to violence.

But over time, he started using his talents, in a way to instigate, to instigate battle rather than to move against it. His power became too went to his head or at least that's what the legends say. And he, and he basically betrayed the blessed realm, betrayed, Raythellian, and, started working against the, the blessed realm's interest, in a way to overtake and, in a way to overtake and, effectively, take over, the the, take over the the blessed realm the blessed realm, itself. Basically, you usurp the the rightful king. He was then run underground.

Or is it that he's dead? I mean, this was over a century ago, so it's possible that he died of natural causes, or it's possible that somebody killed him. Just depends on who you talk to as far as, like, what what sort of end he had. But, in general, there's a general agreement that, that he is, he's dead. That's what the statue's name was, Warath.

Mhmm. Right. So, the statue itself wasn't wasn't labeled, or did does it does it say that if you open it? The picture. Yeah.

One the picture said it. Oh, it's a statue of Borath? Okay. Well, there you go. It it's it's a it is a statue of Borath, but, the the symbol is that of Aravos.

The statue is that of, once you start thinking about the betrayer and Borath, and and how that all shaped out. Like, you look at the statue and you're like, well, if I was a goblin and I was making a statue of an elf, I might I might make it look like this. Right? I think he's still alive in the statue. Oh, he's just sleeping.

Maybe the statue is him. Einhorn is Finkel. Finkel is Einhorn. He does Einhorn. I'm not familiar with the reference.

Don't bother. Compute me. Oh my gosh. No. You're fired.

I can't believe you. I can. Alright. So what I guess my question in my head for kind of processing and or rolling is why is this particular kind of statue and enclave, like, in this particular area? And being worshipped.

Also, Chris hasn't moved in a while. Oh, really? Yeah. You're holding your, hand up to your face. He's moving he's moving for me.

Then it must be me. Must it must be my interwebs. Oh, the interwebs. I can see Chris drinking something. So anyway, I just I just think that's a little weird.

That I'm not moving? Or No. That this particular, statue is in this particular spot. So Right. That's all.

So Is that particular arc elf? Yeah. Lots of particularly problematic situations. Yeah. I don't know what the I don't know what your guys' problem is.

It's just it's just a random elf in a random cave with a bunch of random goblins and, and a random statue. Oh, because the elves, they don't they don't play with goblins. Yeah. That's traditionally correct. Right.

Yeah. They don't play with goblins. Now they might subjugate goblins or kill them all. That's the only reasonable situation I can come up with on this. Much subjugation going on.

They're working relentlessly restore him to power. You know? These goblins seem to be coming from nowhere. Right. But he wants to destroy the ark or destroy stuff.

And he wants to destroy the temple Right. The Rhesian. Mhmm. Should we try to destroy the statue if you want to? Just wonder what jumps out as underneath the statue.

Jason, you're also badly injured. I just want you to be aware of that. Yes. I am severely injured. Yes.

I'm quite aware. That that healing potion is no good. Why is it no good? Yeah. I've rolled the wheeler's towards the D 8.

Oh, that sounds like Jesus. Okay. So, outside yeah. So look looking at the statue itself, like, there, there are a number of additional, like, offerings that are on it, like, you know, bird bones, and, bird bones, other other animal creature bones, handles, a number of knickknacks, like, things that look like they may have been stolen from the village, but nothing, like, of any real value. But there are things that you recognize that have gone missing in the village that are sitting at the, sitting at the feet of this of this, statue.

Which are what? Just random things. Oh, okay. Like yeah. They're only they're they're not significant.

They're only significant in the in in that you're like, hey. That went missing a couple weeks ago, and here it is. You know? That kind of a thing. So I apologize that these guys are sneaking into the village Yeah.

Unaware. Because we say we're doing a whole lot more than just making thievery of like, trinkets. Okay. Is that pretty much sorry. Oh, go ahead.

So is that pretty much everything I see? Yeah. That's all that you that's all that you're able to find here in the in the chapel. K. K.

Would we know, Chris, if that's where the power came from that one lady to be able to disguise herself as my sister? That would be an occult role. I don't have good occult roles. Clark, I think it's bad assault roles. Oh.

You want me to roll to you, Chris? I I will I will grant you I will grant you this because our did do some rolling on that creature. The ability to shape change and the ability to read one's mind and be able to use that information against you and that kind of thing is something that, is something that hags are known for. So Yeah. That's right.

Yeah. Call now. So it's it's definitely something where yeah. So it's definitely something where she, where she basically just had the ability to do that just inherently. So, alright.

So you want anything else you wanna do before before moving on? Sounds like you got one one vote to do one one vote to go. Yeah. Everything else in on on this, everything else here, seems to be, nothing else pops out as something to pay attention. I'm tempted.

I wanna push this statue over, but I don't think that'd be a great idea. Oh, okay. That's right. You can do it if you want to. It's a it's a decent way of defiling something.

Can we, grab a hold of these stolen trinkets? I mean, I would do that if no one else has space or whatever if they're not, like I do not have, like, any space. Yeah. I don't think you do. They're not if they're not big, they don't thing.

They they aren't they aren't big. It's nothing that's, nothing that you're that you specifically, nothing that you're specifically, like, missing or anything. So or it's nothing that nothing large. So I like, it's nothing to go in your inventory. You just pick up the stuff.

So Alright. Done by someone. If I have to walk over there and pick them up, I will. And walk over there and pick them up. Good.

I walk over there and pick them up. So you have, so when you get back out to the mouth of this cave, to the north, you have, you have what is legitimately an alcove. There appears to be some, there appears to be some bed rules that are set up there. Looks like it's a sleeping area. And then to your south, there's just, the the cave itself just kinda curves back towards where you were where you were coming from before.

You wanna you wanna follow the cave? Can do you wanna follow the tunnel, or do you wanna backtrack? Or I have to press on. I would, like to be healed up a bit before we proceed much further if if there's a body who's able to do so. That seems like a solid plan.

Right. Yep. I have, that ability. Just let me stay right here. There.

Spell focus, so I can do that. Perfect. I do not have focus. I just did it. I swear.

I just had it. Hey. There we go. You maybe maybe you removed the focus unintentionally. I could have.

Role healing. There. I think my mouse is playing with me. Right. I don't see a die.

You got it? Well, no die happened because you just click on the well, maybe do you see an apply healing button underneath Karsten's on hands? Ah, yes. There you go. Okay.

So that's six. Okay. Good. Good. That puts me a little over halfway.

Alright. Another ten minutes, and I'll test it. Oh, Carson is, refocusing. Sameer, I think I use one of my focus spells or something of that nature. I'll do the same focusing.

And then I'll do one more on myself. Apply the healing, Jason. Oh, yes. Thank you. Look at that.

Nice. There. Will that work? So we get 20. That's, that's close.

Close enough for who it's for. K. Alright. I'm gonna do one on me, maybe. Oh, oh, oh, there we go.

Oh, poof stain. There we go. Chris, have we not been in that green area that's, like, reflecting up north? No. We have.

You have. Yeah. Oh. That that was the lake. Yeah.

That was the the pond. Okay. I was oh, I thought you said we came from the South. I'm sorry. Nope.

Nope. You came from the Northwest. So the the South would be going back towards the, the cave entrance that you guys were that you guys came into. So you so far, you guys have done almost a circle. So you came up and around and came down and started coming back towards where you were.

So there's you've got you've got a, you've got a section of unexplored tunnel that you haven't that you haven't looked at yet, from where you are. To the South. To the South. Yeah. Okay.

Hey. So my character sheet, do I just click on focus pool to update that so that I have my focus again? Or Right. Yeah. There's not a there's not an automation that you can click that'll just automatically give you your focus back.

You have to you have to click on it. That's the the button I click on. Right? Right. Once the dot is in there, we're all set.

I believe so. Yes. Okay. If not, we'll have to fix it later. Not a big deal.

Exactly. We know that you we know that you tried to focus. Mhmm. I was trying. Hey.

Okay. So you guys are yep. Yep. I'm ready to move. Just a minute.

Again, my mouse is being silly. In the pooper scooper. Here we go. Yep. There we go.

Boop. Boop. Boop. Boop. These my k.

Control pad. Give me one second so I can reveal reveal a thing here. My concern about playing tonight without Ramsey is he gives us all the wonderful bonuses. I'm sure he would anyway. Mhmm.

He would what? Bonus us with his blessings. The players ain't here. The the character does nothing. Right.

That's what I'm saying. We all die. Probably not. Alright. So as you as you It's not depressing.

Further notice that there is a key. What? There's a key in the in the tunnel, so the tunnel kind of breaks off. Oh, no. Not moving.

Do you have the little person, the token controls thing selected on the left hand side of the screen? Yep. On the left hand side of the screen, they're like, where where there are all those controls, you got, like, the measuring thing and the little person. Do you have the person selected? Do I have any of those selected?

Like, the the person, is that is that the one that's Yes. Okay. But I don't know how to unselect them. No. You want that's that's what you want.

Yeah. Oh, I can't I can't move my guy. Onto unselect. There we go. Holy moly.

K. Awesome. Are we going up these steps? I would say yes. Right.

You guys head up the tunnel. Is that up or is it down? It is up. It's up even though we're going down topically. Glad that you're picking up what I'm throwing down here.

You go up the steps, and the steps, come to a, come to a landing. But there doesn't appear to be like, there's it basically just comes to a dead end at the top of the landing. Appears to? Appears to. Yes.

Is it a trend? Do we have any inclination that we should make a If you wish to make a perception check, you are more than welcome to make a perception check. I think we're all feeling a perception check here. That's what I'm saying. That's an attribute?

Yes. Mhmm. That's attribute. Bottom. Everybody roll your perceptions.

Well, I don't have that much. Holy moly. Need that to increase. Woah. How does Kihir have a seven?

Holy cow. Mhmm. I don't think they did it again. He's he's an expert in perception. He's a piece.

What the come on. You're slighting me, Chris. It's not just me. I don't know. I'm sorry.

I think it's It's under attributes, and then you have to scroll that thing down to the blue ones, black ones. Alright. We'll try this. It's not the right thing, but good. Hey.

Look at that. Better than a five. I'm rolling hot tonight. Alright. Interesting.

Okay. So, let's see here. Here in Carson, you notice that, there appears to be, some sort of raft coming through the stone. There appears to be some sort of hidden door. In order to be able to Oh, just a little bit.

Door. Maybe. In order to be able to get to the, in order to be able to get through the door, you are going to need this is just gonna be a straight up skill challenge, so there's not a, there's not a puzzle to solve on this specific one. You will need to make a, an investigation. Give me a second here.

Just I need to check the skills, the proficiencies. Nice. In order to be able to get through this door, I need somebody to make a thievery or a crafting check. I might have crafting. I don't know if I have thievery.

I have crafting. Wait. I'm blind. So Chris, are we on the right plateau, or is the plateau down by where Jason is? It's it's down by where Jason is.

Okay. So it's, like, right right there. Yeah. That's me. I'm there now.

Alright. I didn't think Oh, boo. I can hear you work on the door for a while, but it is extremely well made. You're not able to figure out exactly what's what's, what the mechanism is in order to be able to, in order to be able to open it. So what one are we doing first?

Craft? Crafting? It's an either or. It's crafting or thievery depending. Oh, I mine isn't very good, so maybe we'll get lucky.

Yeah. Same thing. This is this is a little bit above your pay grade. So it's in oh, okay. Oh, and crafting is one of those one of those skills that does require you to be trained in trained in it in order to be able to use it.

So, it looks like you are untrained, Clark. So I am untrained. Yep. Sorry. I didn't.

Are you Severy? I'm chasing Severy. Severy? You didn't know. Severy is trained.

Every time I roll the die, I get one point higher. Everybody wants everybody wants 14. Yeah. You you know there's a door there. You just can't figure out how to get it to work.

How to open it? Yeah. Greg. We had explosives. That would work.

If you had explosives, that would work. You have explosives? Nope. Nope. I don't, unfortunately.

I have some flint and steel. Yeah. That that won't work. Of fire retaliation. Well, unless the door attacks you, it's not gonna do you much better.

Yeah. I can see that. I'm unsure. Well, I guess that's So what do we do? Just turn around?

Yeah. I mean, at this point, like, you you guys have all tried to open it. You can't figure out the mechanism, so you're really your best your best bet at this point is just to turn around and see if there's another way through. Okay. Is this this is not something that, I was looking to see it.

I don't see where it gives me an option. Should we resend hero point reused? I mean, I don't have any more hero points, so you might want to. Yeah. I don't think that I've awarded any hero points since Well, I mean, we still got nineteen minutes.

Can we all start with one, though? There were some rules I thought that you could not use a hero point on. Well, there's let let me let me there there are some rules that you can't use a hero point on, but this still counts. If you have zero point spend, you could use that, but you do have the let's try this again as well that you could do too. But What is k.

Oh, I forgot that. I just used a hero point. Yep. Oh, you did? Okay.

Alright. Hey. You know better than me. Good job. 24.

Wow. That's that's pretty good. Well, no. I wrote 10, which was worse than the first 10. I know.

But you got a 10. I know. And added to it. Okay. So, you like, you start working on it.

You can't quite figure it out. You get really frustrated. Get really frustrated, walk you know, get up, start walking around pacing for a bit, and then all of a sudden it just clicks. You go over you look at you look at the rock configuration and, like, if this rock goes over here and this rock goes over here, then it's going to make a design that looks like a that looks like a crow. You move them, and then the, the two rocks that you move into those two indentations kind of sink in, and the wall just opens up.

Speak friend and enter. And as the, anticipator opens up. And as the, the door opens, you you hear voices on the other side say, what was that? Everybody roll initiative. Oh, man.

Man. And Elmer doesn't get to play with us. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

How do I roll initiative when the little light doesn't show up on the die? Yeah. It acts like Yeah. Give us give us a second. Oh, oh, sorry.

Sorry. There it is. Oh, I got a good one. How do I switch this over right now? It's rolling initiative crafting.

I changed. Yeah. Your Your initiative religion. Right. It's because that was the last, role that you made.

You can hit to where it says perception or religion or crafting and just scroll and click on one different. Right. If you take your if you go to that little side menu that you have and you click on attributes and you've got initiative and you go to where perception is and you roll and you click that, that'll roll your perception initiative. But your crafting initiative and your perception initiative, I think, are the same. Okay.

Not not just for everybody, but Sameer specifically. Well, my crafting is a plus six. My I guess my perception is a plus six. Yep. Okay.

Alright. And, Karsten, can you roll, you roll perception initiative as well? Looks like you got robotics. No slipping force. No.

Oh, I see. I thought I switched it. I'm sorry. I mean, it's the same it's the same modifier. Oh, it is?

Yeah. It's plus four. Okay. Well, then we'll we'll just we'll just keep it. So I'll click Sorry about that.

I Oh, no worries. That's not a big deal at all. So you're at twenty one, and we will go ahead and roll back us and go ahead and begin that encounter. So we can work that out. Through that at the s in the wall?

Yeah. So it's basically like there's a tunnel through the s. Okay. Who's first? I am.

And then So Clark. Humanoid. Is Carson last? I can't oh, I how do I move that thing up top? Oh, like a little bit.

Need to move it, like, one space over because everything's hitting it. Can't. I, I I have it I have it I have it in that position. I'll I'll switch it back to the center for next time, but you are first. So Okay.

Carson Europe. I I so if you're moving that, then I am going to move I'm gonna get hammered. I'm gonna move 20 or I'm not gonna move anything. Why? Well, for the reason, I can move okay.

There. 15. I I can only move 15. Should be able to move 20. Right?

Yep. K. Like, is one reloaded? I should be. The only thing I added to my load is that letter.

Or you also have the you switched out your armor, so you're running around with armor, extra suit of armor in your in your, I think. You're done full plate. So that's The chain was in my backpack. Yeah. So, I mean, you're you're basically you are currently on five nine bulk, five light, and you're encumbered at at nine.

So you can only move you you you can only move 20 feet per action instead of 25. Yeah. Okay. So I can. Okay.

Oh, five, ten, fifteen, twenty. So that's my one move, and then I think I'll just raise my shield. Or do you guys think I should go right I don't wanna go, like, right in the middle of everything. Oh, you the the champion is supposed to be the guy who's getting attacked. He's always waiting behind.

I mean, whatever. Oh. Go right up to him and smack him. I can't I can't oh, I can't. Have enough to do that, do you?

Yeah. I just I I can do that right now. Right? Yeah. I can move two two actions, and then I can shield then.

Yep. Yeah. Okay. I won't be able to raise my shield, but I might be able to kill the guy. And I believe that you have a reactive shield that you can I don't remember what that means?

Oh, yeah. I killed the guy. Did you turn the game over the guy? Oh. Oh, are you kidding?

How dumb. But you credit. I did. Did you roll the critical? Did you roll the critical damage?

I did. I got one. It was it was an eight or a seven and then moved on me. Gotcha. It's unfortunate.

Alright. I'm done. Alright. So you run up to the guy, run up to this specific guy, which which is a, kind of common goblin warrior. Run up to it and point at it.

Next up is his turn. He's going to move back over here and wait. First things first. Not gonna move he he's going to pack Carson first with a sword for three points of damage. Boom.

Off my armor. It still gets me. I can just keep doing that. Just leave it alone. But and he's gonna run away, and he's going to enter into a goblin song.

Ah, I could've killed him when I did. I can hear it. Alright. Which is going to fail Yes. Which is very sad.

It's sad. And now, Sameer, you are up. Arced and get out of combat. Alright. I don't know what it's doing, but it's not even what I told you.

Yeah. I clicked on my character sheet to get it to minimize, and it decided to do that. Oh, well, no worries. And go 35 feet or 30? 30.

I'm 30. You're it's 25 feet unless you're a asshole. His character says 30 when you hover over him. Okay. Yeah.

30. Clerk says 20 and mine says 25. Yep. Mhmm. You must be you must be, elves must be oh, I think elves are faster than everybody else.

Wander up somewhere in that range there. Yep. I'll, target this guy, target this I'm gonna target this guy and this guy. No. I'm not.

I'm targeting this guy and this guy. I did it. Thanks. And then we'll do an electric arc on those two. Go ahead.

I I'm trying. Impales. That could be unfortunate for him. Second one succeeds. So go for no damage.

That might be my highest damage on that spell. Oh. That's the And you do kill the goblin that was attempting to Alright. That was the nasty guy I wanted it off. Yes.

The the one that was basically making a rant that was picky goblin song. You started melting out some pretty offensive lyrics and then got zotted to death. Mhmm. For speed. I'm looking good.

Alright. The other guy took three damage? No. It's that guy's turn. He's going to move up, target Carson, and pull out his dog slicer back.

Oh. Miss. Yeah. Miss. Ouch.

I splatted it. Spectacular. And it is time to refresh hero points so everybody gets a hero point. Yay. And then the other guy, he is going to take a look at the guy that zotted his buddies and Mhmm.

Get him, pull out his, pull out his turbo. You I'm hitting for two points of damage to Samir. Oh. Then Samir. He's going to make a would you attempt to demoralize you with a rude gesture?

That's me. He's gonna flash you. Samir. Thank you. And fail to make Samir demoralize.

Uh-oh. Good. So here, you're up. I really don't need to flank this guy. I think I can get up there with two moves.

You do need to be raging. Yep. I'm supposed to be automatically raging. I saw some stuff pop up here. So when you did the initiative, as long as you're able to move freely, you're accurate.

I'll just pull it onto your character. Yeah. I was just trying to hit use. Okay. Go.

Go. Go. I'm trying to figure out how do I swing it. For the record, I do like it above. It was easier.

You like what? Oh. Just to use the thing on the above versus the bottom. Off to the side? Okay.

I will take that under advisement. If you want, I can totally I can totally switch it back to the way it was before if this is too confusing. If everybody does, I'm just, it's not easy. I like it on the other ones, like the attributes because you can see them all, but maybe not. I don't know.

I have a big screen, so maybe it gets in the way for other people. Yep. On the I don't know. I don't know. No.

That didn't I don't think that ever bothered me. The one on the side here, because I have a small screen, it keeps, like, shifting things around and messes my whole screen up. Yeah. So I didn't mean to do tighten swing because that was locked on. Oh, yeah.

You wanna toggle that off. But at at the either way, like, I'm not gonna make you reroll that because Woah. Bye. Yeah. It would have been ten and ten, so, like, 20.

Yeah. Titan swing added eight? It added a second die. Yeah. Yeah, just make sure that you've got time to swing toggled off at this point, unless you're fine on using it.

So alright. Cool. And, Karsten, you're up. Kill him, Karsten. I'm gonna attack him.

K. I moved. Click. And whack. Oh, I'll take that.

Hit. Hit. Big damage again. What the heck? Oh, another one, Yeah.

Anyway I'm like, dude. Try to kill him again. I wanna try him again. One damn it. Oh, jeez.

Oh, god. That's Samir. Yeah. I can see that. That's just Now he's gonna critically hit you.

I know what? Samir, you're up. Yep. Oh, Samir can kill him. Shoot.

Do it, Samir. I mean, I only took one damage from him, so I don't know how much life they have if they're traditional, but Got him. Alright. Let's do this. We'll do we'll do this.

Let's do this. Wait a minute. I'm rolling to it. I should be yes. Rolling to attack.

Okay. I'm rolling to attack. Oh, that's probably gonna hurt. Oh, that's a that's a hit. That's a critical hit.

That's a free nice hit. Alright. So then I go back up here to roll damage. Yes? Right.

I just click roll damage. Ouch. Isn't the best role by any stretch of the imagination? It was not, but it was enough. Really?

You success so how do you want to finish it? Oh. Yeah. So this little pebble that's just Yep. Let's go.

Laying right down here. This little pebble right there. I don't know. Maybe that's not a little pebble, but looks a little on my screen. Yeah.

It just just takes, like, this flying leap in a nice, like, grand arc and just comes straight down on top of his head. Boom. Nice. Alright. And he crumples to the ground.

Hey, crumples. Hey. We go up the level yet? Gotcha. Not yet.

How do I grab the stuff? Oh, what stuff? Oh, party stash. Isn't there something right there? What is that elven elven skull thingy?

There is going to be time to cover that. Oh, that is not Luigi. Can we put most of the stuff in the parties? Is this the party stash? It is.

Yeah. Give me a second, man. I missed something. Oh, the party sheet. Just give me a second.

Party sheet. So there are a number of arrows, dog slicer, health leather armor, short short bows, and those sorts of things in there as well as, as well as those things. So, there was the soothing scent, the wolf fang, the effervescent, at Collei, the vaccine minor, the battering snare are all new, are all things that you found in there as well as the grim sand glass, and what you basically pull off of the bodies. I like them. Some so the, let let me know when you guys are are finished looking at the loop.

I don't wanna I don't wanna rush it. I'm just reading them. I I looked at it, and I didn't see is this make selection? I would think we wanna take it all, like the wolf fangs, soothing, the effervescent, the vaccine, and the lethargy poison. I don't know where you're looking.

How do you get to that? In the party stash? We open the party sheet and then click the stash button on the right. Oh, that's probably why you send that to me again. Totally missed that.

Yeah. Close it out. Chat. Click open brown sheet. Yep.

I got it. I did look in the stash. What it went? You scroll down. Yep.

Sumables. Oh. Grim sand glass. Chris, if we try to carry all this, is it too much? I can't do that.

You just have to look at your you just have to look at your bulk, in your character sheet. So, like, right now, right here bulky. You're not encumbered until you until you've reached 11 bulk. So you've got you've got two you've got two bulk three light left that you can be carrying before you're encumbered. Honestly, the only reason why I could hear is or not here.

The only reason why Karsten is overloaded at this point is because he's carrying a extra set of armor with him. Do we just drag and drop? Yep. Alright. Also, something to note, you guys have all, you you all have reached enough XP to level two, three.

I am planning on let's let's hold off on leveling until, next session, and then we'll just get that all taken care of next session. Idea. I hit it, Chris. Sorry. You hit it?

I hit it. Can I move the lethargy poison to Elwar? Yeah. Oh, that's a lot of bulk, though. What's four l mean?

You guys can you guys can work that out in You can just keep it right where it's at. Right? Yeah. And we won't need it right this moment. Well, there's a lethargy poison for each of us.

Oh, that's in our whole party stash is what you're saying. Yeah. Yep. I'm sorry. Unless you're actively going to be unless you're actively gonna be using it at some point in this, in this adventure, you don't necessarily need it in your, your inventory.

Oh, okay. Sorry. Alright, Chris. I have a blessing of the devoted. Make a selection.

Don't know what the I mean, I see three selections. I looked at them. Mark, did you click the did you click the, or did you click the level up button? Yeah. I was supposed to, wasn't I?

Oh, we're waiting till next session. Oh, can I just close it out? Yeah. I'll switch it. I did the same thing with Cahir.

Alright. Now well, shoot. Dang. I mean, I heard you say that. I didn't know it was attached to seeing that button.

You heard me say it and you agreed with it too. You were like, that's a great idea. I know. But I didn't know it was attached to getting the XP. That's why I thought it was weird.

No. I I I assign your XP. You don't pick up your XP. Oh, it said I I it has enough XP to level up, and it said add. Pull that through for a week.

Okay. Well, in the future, that add button means I don't have to do anything. Level up. Yeah. You don't have to you don't have you don't have to worry about anything for your XP.

Perfect. I I have it set to automatically add to your character. So Okay. Good. Okay.

Alright. So so as you're looking around here, you do notice that that blue light that you saw off in the distance when you were over at the, when you were at the at the lake, that blue light is radiating from this, this elven skull that's on a that's on a little pedestal. Oh, woah. Alright. It's so nice.

As you're as you're, as you stare have phones in them. That's weird. Sorry. Anyway, as we stare at him. Yeah.

Give me a second here. Okay. Bless my tongue of thought for a second. Yeah. That's good.

So there's this eerie there's this eerie ghostly blue glow that's radiating from the skull itself. As you approach it, you hear faint whiskers that emanate from the skull, which say, the hour of betrayal draws near. The past must be undone over and over and over again. I would like anybody who approached a skull to make a will save. I haven't moved, I think, from my spot.

Do you still want me to make the save? Yeah. I'd say anybody who's within 10 feet of it. Okay. Make the make the make the will save.

Make the wheel safe. Make the eye safe. You say? There we go. I don't know.

The wheel safe. They're the worst roles on planet Earth. Jeez. Oh, Pete. Oh, no.

They're still better than mine. Depending on what happens, I may use my special ability because this is ridiculous. Your damage, though. Your damage has been pretty sucky. Yeah.

I will confess. I'm pretty bad. Okay. Here, you, you Clark, if if I start describing before you decide before I start describing things, you will need to determine whether or not you're gonna use your hero point. Oh, did I fail?

I can't answer that question. I think that's defeating the point. You don't plan? Yeah. You you you you can ask the question, but I'm under no obligation to answer you.

And even if I did answer you, I have I have I I can lie if I so desire in this specific then I will just roll a hero point. Oh. Oh, much better. That's beautiful. Alright.

So as you as you approach the not as you approach, but, like, as the waves and the mutterings of of like, the the mutterings are like mad ravings that are coming from the skull, and this starts to penetrate yours. It starts to penetrate your brain itself, but you through a sheer, through through sheer willpower, you are able to stave off the, the crazed mutterings of the skull. But, you know, as it was as it was starting to penetrate your mind, you start that you must, that you must go to the temple. You must activate the time turner. You must fulfill the will of the betrayer, but you're able to gave it off.

Good. Or or, as you, see here. As you look at the, this goal, you you look at this goal, you do see that there are a number of, religious, symbols that are engraved onto it and also onto the, onto the actual pedestal itself. If, I I would like anybody who is able to roll a a religion, arcana, or an occult. It's me.

Yeah. I have that. I'm sure other people have something. I was supposed to I was posting lookout again. Do you guys need me to come over there and take a gander at it?

If you have one of the high roles Oh. Doing a cult. You want me? Hey. Look at that.

Nice. I don't know that I'd be any good at it, to be honest. Well, it'll be different information depending on what What your role? That you're using. Yeah.

I can, I can wander on over here and and join you guys in the emptied craze here? Go ahead. Oh, let's take a good look at this thing. I can't see in the dark. Anyway alright.

So what's what's up now? Roll a arcana or a knowledge religion or a occult. There's an arcana. Did anybody roll arcana? Nope.

No. Because I don't have it. Oh, just what I oh my gosh. Just what I always wanted. Alright.

So, we'll go ahead and start with the religion check. Hey, here you are aware of some, dark magics that are associated with, Erebos, that basically used sentient creatures, bones, and blood to power dark rituals. You definitely to go with those. Yeah. You definitely suspect that that is what this is.

Also, granted the that there was a, like, there's this mind worm that that was happening for you. You are also able to determine that this specific, ritual has something to do with mind control. Karsten, your occult will tell you that, there are a number of ways to, with something like this, something that's weird like this. The way to, the way to purify, or the the way to get rid of this thing would be to purify it in some way. Generally, first objects such as this do not do well with, do not do well with a number of different things.

Could be could be using a a specific blessing or specific phrasing, that that may work, that a specific phrase that may, that may break the incantation or the enchantment. If it's possible to move this, then, you know, some sort of, like, some sort of, like, terrifying water or holy water could as well could break the enchantment as well. And, you, yeah. So that that's what your cult if you is, like, there are a couple of ways that this might be able to be, broken. The Arcana, I'll I'll I'll still give you this because, you know, it's a it's something that you'd probably be able to put together, with, you know, with kind of cultivating this stuff.

But, Sameer, you would also know or you would also kind of be able to put together that this is a mind control device, and the Goblins don't necessarily appear to be you know, they're they're kind of working differently than what you normally see goblins working as. They're working with elves, which is not a common thing. So you have some suspicion that there's something to do with this object that is causing the goblins to be acting the way that they are. So do I be mind may be in mind control? The domination statement from earlier.

Do I know where to get holy water, or can I make holy water? Let me see here. Mhmm. There there doesn't appear to be any kind of spell that you're aware of that would create holy water, but there are, but holy water is definitely something that you can pick up. Like, holy water is something that you could pick up in a, at at any temple.

Go ahead and roll a No. But that doesn't do me any good currently. It doesn't do any good currently. Yes. Roll a roll a knowledge religion.

Roll another knowledge religion as you're contemplating holy water. K. Yeah. You're you're not you're not sure. Not sure.

Laying on my hands won't count for anything? Well, you could try it. See what happens. Yeah. I don't wanna just I probably should not just try things.

So It'd be fun. So it could be fun. I mean, yeah. But it could also not be fun. It could also not be fun.

Yeah. Okay. Well, I know holy water. So if I have holy water, I can just come we can come back potentially. Right?

Yeah. So Yeah. Your buddy at the temple ought to be able to whip something up, it seems like. Yeah. Well, so so here's some things, though.

I mean, some things to things to just keep in mind. If, you know, you definitely can run back up to the temple, but, you know, you do know that things are kind of, like, pretty hairy down pretty hairy up there. Here. Yep. The town is under attack, and you do know it's under attack.

So they might not be able to, like, get to you very quickly. Right. But, the I gave you I I gave you two potential things. One was the holy water. The other one was a specific a specific phrase, or blessing or something like that.

So, I So in the letter that we had, there was something of a little bit of a prayer toward the end of the letter in closing if I remember correctly. And then I can go back up there maybe. Well, you have the letter. Right. But I I thought I had it right also.

I thought there was a description in the chat. Chat. There is. You do have the letter inside your inventory as well. So you can just go into your inventory and click on blood stained letter in Godland tunnels.

A Rethalians light reach even those dark places, and justicar scales are to be balanced against this evil was the last sentence. Right. So Alright. And Maybe a car salesman up what you're throwing down with the current current information. Like, I wouldn't know how to initiate.

Was that part of the occult thing that you, age to hear? Carson did the occult, and Cahir did the religion. Okay. So alright. So part of what was was stated was that, there may be a certain phrase or Yeah.

Something of that nature that acts as a kill switch to the whole thing. Right. And so I'm suggesting that maybe part of the, the letter that we found on the statue Yep. That last sentence in there is a blessing that may counteract and and kill the enchantment on this horse skull, some unsuspecting victim. So, anyway So So Zach, being the religious zealot that you are, I thought, perhaps you would be the the prime candidate to read off this blessing to the skull and see if it shuts up.

The whole blessing? Oh, that last sentence of that letter. I will move over closer then to I'm not moving. Whisper in its ear the sweet nothings. Well, I'm gonna try.

Oh my god. Your ticbone ear. Alright. And I will whisper in the ear, may Raytheon's light reach ray the lion's light reach even these dark places, and dustikars scales Yep. Ever be balanced against this evil.

Alright. As you say those words, the skull's light dissipates, and it crumbles. As it does so, you feel this weight that you didn't know was you didn't realize this weight had been growing on you, but you feel the this weight disappear, as as the as the skull itself just kind of crumbles to bits. Now, Alright, Voorath. Rough way to go.

As as it crumbles, you do hear a do hear a a phrase, that kind of travels on the air. And it says, the betrayer ascends where light and shadows embrace the defoliation beneath the ruined spires of. What? You have to write that down somewhere? I will.

At the very least, drop it in the chat. Mirror sends where light and shadows embrace the desolation. Also, I didn't actually, give me one second here. Star Wars character sheet gave me a place to take notes, which I somewhat did. This one does not.

Believe it's got a note taking action, maybe, in the biography. The little person with a book with a head on it. There's a campaign section. Oh, there's a note section. Okay.

Excellent. Yes. Alder of Cthulhu. If you tell this picture of your fellow, just shut up again. We gotta keep going down.

No idea where this Oh. Cthulhu. Cthulhu. How do you say his name? Her name?

Othar. And it's not his name, her name. It's it's a place. It's, Kathar? It's referred to generally as as a place, so you're able to put that together.

Oh, okay. A place in the former world before the desolation of Great Silane upheaved the whole earth. K. I'm fading fast. I'm sorry.

Oh, no. It's not a problem. I'm just trying to to find the, okay. Alright. You do also, you do also as the altar itself just crumbles, you do see a piece of stone.

Oh. Not really stone, but more of a gem, that is left in its wake. Anybody who wishes to may use a crafting skill if they have crafting, trained, to identify that gem. I do not have crafting. Mhmm.

Crafting check. Check. Oh, a famous gem. You sure you sure are safe? Nice in real.

Oh, look at that. A five. Oh my gosh. Alright. Well, there's a stone on the ground.

Right. Oh, gosh. This is a asinine. Oh, freak. I hate this.

Mostly because the thing hate me. Did I reroll high enough? You did. Only dust. It looked like.

You did I you were able to identify the piece of stone as or a gem as a chronal prism piece, which for those of you keeping record at home, that is the gemstone that you need in order to repair the, the great time turner. Hey. We don't think you have enough to fix the entire thing, but it's a start. Hey. So that's in the chat then, Chris?

Do we get to pull that, or does it just go into your I'll just I'll drop it into your inventory. So you've got it on you now. It it's marked as a zero value, object. It doesn't have a gold piece value assigned to it, but that's not because it's not valuable. That's just because it's so valuable, like, there's not really a price that can be put on it.

Can I ask a dumb question? Like, did any of those pieces be on the statue that we didn't tip over before? It's possible. And I think that since we got Clark Faden and it's so close to 10, and the last time we met, we went way over 10. Yeah.

Now would be a good time to call it, for the night, so that people can, you know Get to bed early. Get to bed. Yeah. So, Chris, will you help me remember to go back over and try to blow that other statue up? Sure.
