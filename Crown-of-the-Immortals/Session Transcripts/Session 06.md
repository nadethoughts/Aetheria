That note, let's kill some people. Alright. Alright. So when last we met, you guys were six months had passed since the since the temple had appeared. You were trying to figure out what was going on with, you you've been chasing down, the goblins.

You've also you were also, trying to, figure out where how to fully repair the, the great time turner in the temple. You have a temporary solution. You don't know how long that will hold, however. So that is one of those things where it's a little bit you know, it's it's working for now, but, you know, you're not really sure exactly how that's gonna how that's gonna pan out in the long term. And by working, I mean it's not leaking sand.

You don't really know what the time turner does. You don't really know what happens there. So, that's another another thing. You had decided after after a little bit of discussion and going back and forth on, you know, what to do next. You've decided to try to pursue the goblins in the burning wood.

You went down and met with Gald, who is, Cahir's brother, who has had many encounters with the goblins, over the over the course of the past six months. And asked him to be a little to be a guide to bring you into the belly of the beast kind of thing. Gald agreed to go and to help you out, and then you guys decided that you were going to go at the end of or at the beginning of the day. After having, bedded down for the night, you did hear an explosion, in the direction of the town. Turned around and ran back to the town to, see goblins pouring out of the stone, the stone wall that had been a cave in, in in the tunnel to the time temple.

You guys then went down into the town into the pit where the temple where the temple is and engaged the, engaged goblins along with Gald and two other members of the solar sentinels. And that is where we are. In the middle of we're gonna crush a lot. Yeah. Some some kind of crushing.

That's right. Yes. Yes. Okay. Harrison, you cut your hair.

Alright. Yeah. Different. I got tired of staring at a pixely I like that. Character art.

Yeah. And I asked Clark for a character description and then made an AI generated character for him. He got to choose which one he wanted. I gave him the dose of, like, seven different ones, but They literally were the same thing with, like, one minor variation. So That's AI art that's AI art, man.

Yeah. Oh, Chris. I'm just having fun. I missed you. That's what that means.

It's it was wonderful. You did a nice job. Oh. And I did. I did pick a pick a new character.

Well, sorry. Picture. Right? Correct. And I need to set up hero points.

So give me one second. That's okay. You don't really have to. I'll get them, like, every hour. It's okay.

Everybody resets to one. Oh. So then I gotta find my character. That's a lot. Oh, yeah.

Wow, Chris. That that, picture really is like high definition. Holy moly. You weren't kidding? Dang.

Mhmm. Okay. I got my hero point. I love this sword through the head neck. Well oh my gosh.

That is hilarious. The sword and shield crossed. Stop. Stop. I don't see a shield anywhere.

Yeah. That's because you're not working with your eyes. You see that he's Of course. Yeah. That's crazy.

Yeah. Huge turkey, Jason. That's normal. It's like the king of hearts. Yeah.

Kristen, nice job. Mhmm. Everyone's a crick. Alright. Look at all the goblin turns.

Right. Yeah. I know. I don't think we have enough goblins, just so you know. I think you're focused.

You want some knuckles of fireballs? I discovered exactly how effective a necklace of fireballs is in a second level character's hands. Not gonna make that mistake twice. Alright. So we have, so Karsten just moved up and raised his shield, to be to be able to kind of cover.

Yeah. Now we have some goblins that are that are gonna be taking a turn. So, one in the far back, moves. So the game's going to just run up and get over here, and he's gonna pull out his short bow. Yes.

And he's gonna shoot at the big shiny guy. Need to do Oh. Trying to use my guy just a little bit. He he's trying to use something. He shoots at Carson.

And Carson, the the the arrow glances off your shield as you are in Yeah. As you're in full defense. Pretty good roll. Time I do something. Now we have a solar sentinel star.

Yeah. Solar sentinels. I don't even know what they look like. Oh, I didn't see them in there. See them.

So this guy's gonna go one, two, three, one, two. It's gonna run straight up to that goblin and hit with a hammer. Yeah. Do it. Oh, that's cool.

Smashes the goblin and its head caves in. Yeah. Mhmm. And Would that hurt? Yeah.

For half a second. Raise. Or two. Maybe. And then she's going to raise her shield.

And she she basically runs up, does a double move, raises her shield as part of the motion, and then hammers the hammers the goblin in the head and calls out behind her, we got you. Is there just one or is there two kind of in there? The well, there you have two solar sentinels that are along with you. Okay. And goblin scurrying up.

Great. Great job. This one is likewise going to target somebody. It's gonna go after the dwarf that just concave its friend's head. Shoot.

Does hits, does hit the, does hit the dwarf sentinel, but, she, she takes it pretty pretty well. So she's got a arrow sticking out of one of her shoulders, but she's not, she's not looking too bad. I'm not upset about it. Okay. Alright.

This goblin is gonna run up, target Karsten, and stab at him. Stab. Nope. The answer is no. The answer is very yes.

Oh. Unfortunately. So, as, so the goblin finds a chink in your armor and slices slices open your side getting really close to one of your kidneys. Oh. That's how.

How many points? Sorry. I'm just trying to I'm dealing 10 points of damage to you. Oh, that's a big one. That is you.

Yeah. That is that's a pretty big one. That's 25%. Let's hold the other one, two, 34, 56781011. Don't do three points of damage each.

Yeah. How'd they get a critical hit on their third? Oh, the 20. Yeah. Good rolling right now, Chris.

You're on fire. Flagel. Oh, he goes. This one runs up, to get into a flanking position, unintentionally getting flanked himself, but he does not have a does not have an action left over. This one does though.

It's gonna run up, and gonna target the dwarf and stab the dwarf. Oh, and miss the dwarf. Yeah. Excellent. Alright.

Next, solar sentinel comes. Rescue. And he is going to come down the come down the steps, run through the group, and he's going to target the flanking, the the goblin over over yonder. Where's yonder? Swing with his two handed bastard sword for max damage and a crit.

Holy cow. He slices. He dices. He Yeah. A little overkill.

All of the all of the goblin. Makes it look like it makes it look like he's been doing it for years. Then that one is going to shoot. Sorry. It occurs to me that I could've actually done this all done all this prior to oh, you guys wanna know if you're getting hit, but Probably.

Yeah. Good to know. Shoots, misses. Next one, beams. Shoots, misses terribly.

How many feet can these things move at in one turn? They've got they've got regular movement. They've got regular movement. So it's 25 per action. Oh, okay.

So two turns to get up. Yep. Yeah. Use two actions to get up. And, yeah, target here and shoot him.

And you you get hit by a you get hit by an arrow, as well for four points of damage. And then we have the last goblin turn before the start of the round. And this goblin is going to attack the, the stone man's floor essential that's in front of him in miss. Turn 19. Wow.

Alright. As as that as that goblin kind of, as that goblin runs up there and does his attack, the, you you hear in the tunnel beyond the rumbling of more, of more goblin like noises, and barking of orders. So pretty certain that they are not alone. Excellent. Ower, you are up.

Alright. Very good. Well, I suppose twenty twenty five. Job, Ower. You got this?

You've done it. I'm not gonna do a lot this turn, but that's okay. We're gonna move up just a wee little bit, and then we are going to target these two with a little bit of electric arc. Oh. Alright.

Let's see here. Roll reflex and Oh. Oh, that's a critical failure. We white crit fails. And is the other one the one that's in front of the dwarf that you targeted?

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. These the two furthest. Not a critical well, it could be.

Nine? Yeah. I think it's just a failure. Yeah. Followed by negative nine, it says.

Yep. Right. Sec. Roll the damages. Bam.

Oh. Not bad. Nice. Alright. All things considered.

32 takes double, and 30 or 12 takes normal, which is still Set. Hey. Nice job. Alright. I forgot moving is a but I had to move to get in range, so that's fine.

Alright. Yeah. That's, that's all me. Yeah. Good here.

System plan. Nice job. I still Looks like you had what? Yeah. Pretty solid food.

Oh, dang. I was just sick. Yeah. What test? Well, are you did you What?

Nothing. Nothing. We're all good. So you run up, you swing, you you slice one in half, you have one additional action left. So what are you gonna do?

I'm gonna try to slice this other guy. Yeah. Alright. Get him. Oh, miss.

But and I'm done. Alright. Now you crushed a whole bunch of people. Who's next? Gold.

He's going to knock three arrows and try and kill three goblins. Yeah. I think is what he's going to try to do. See what actually happens. But so first one, the crit failure.

This is not a good start. It is not a good start. Second one, he does hit. Yay. Nine points of damage and giving one of the ranged goblins.

Yeah. He then targets the one right next to him, right next to it. Come on. Misses. Particularly.

That's not terrible. The one that he just shot out, however, it shot at, however, was the one that came up next, and it is going to shoot right back. Then shoot again. Then shoot again. And breaks its bow.

Nothing. It does not break his bow. Critical misses do not break critical misses don't do anything in comp with with combat, but, he still has a very poor showing. Mhmm. Be embarrassed to go home tonight.

That's what you're saying? Exactly. Might not be going home. He might not be going home. Yeah.

I I don't think he's going home. Yeah. We're doing pretty good. We're waiting for the second wave. Alright.

Okay. This one scurries up, pulls out his dog slicer, which is basically a giant knife, but it's effectively a sword for these guys. Takes a swing at Knife. At Cahir, does penetrate through does penetrate through your hide armor and does seven points of damage. What?

So you got plenty of hit points left ish. Good. And this one is going to target the dwarf and shoots. It's gonna hit the dwarf for five points of damage. Penetrates through there and penetrates through the Next up, Sameer.

Oh, oh, it's my turn. Mhmm. So Sameer does a a very flourishing, maneuver with his bow staff and sets it on the on the ground very firmly to then peel over and start vomiting. Trying to remove the sickened condition? Yeah.

How do I do that? How do I gotta roll? Roll a fortitude save. Fortitude. Fortitude.

Alright. We're gonna roll fortitude. Oh, an eight. You do throw up. That is a thing that you do.

Eight. Unfortunately, you're still feeling some puke on the inside. Oh. So you haven't quite completely relieved yourself of all of the food in your in your innards. Mhmm.

You have two more actions. Oh. You can choose to continue puking, or you can cast a spell, or you can do something else. I see. Or you could use a or you could use your hero point to reroll.

Yeah. I thought I'd save. I thought, why not do a hero point and reroll my fortitude save? Yep. Might not be a bad idea.

I don't know how to do that. Oh, if you right click on the the thing, it'll say reroll with hero point on the Right click on The fortitude saving throw card in the chat. If you right click on that, there's a reroll with I rerolled it with and got even worse. Perfect. But it didn't get worse.

You forget. No. Oh, because it does the The hero point adds 10. So you rolled a seven but got a 17, which in fact does indeed Three. Remove your sickened condition.

Yeah. So you are officially no longer sickened. Yay. I vomit I vomit twice. Well, you just you you vomited once, but but, you know, you almost perk up a little bit more.

Yeah. You you you heroically you heroically expelled more vomit. Yes. Yeah. And I'm gonna have to so.

Nice. Alright. So that was a a move. Right? Or ambaction.

Action. So you got two more actions. Which is not enough to, pass any spells. They all require three. It it appears.

Am I correct? Most spells cost two. I don't know about your spells, though. Fear is two. Thunder strike is two.

Flurry of fire is two. So, so that little tiny monitor is not an action. Gotcha. No. No.

You're just looking at the big diamonds. So those all cost two. Electric arc is 2. Cross span this two. Yeah.

Electric arc seems to be a pretty, smart way to go on the one hand. On another hand, I have I was going to do a thing, and I don't know that I actually got it off last time. I think I might not have. You know, this list of, actions that people have taken is pretty extensive because there seem to be a lot of people taking actions. Where did I get runic weapon on?

That was on Cahir. Cahir. Alright. Yep. That's why he's rolling two d 12.

I see. For damage. I will go ahead and, I'll I'll do that spell. Nope. That did not do what I wanted to.

Here we go. We'll do runic weapon. I think I've got Carson targeted. Do anything else I need to do? Nope.

Carson just needs to pull the spell effect runic weapon onto his character sheet. Her character. Perfect. Or onto his character, and he should be good. Perfect.

You officially only have one level one rank one spell slot remaining. Mhmm. And we're gonna burn through these puppies. And you haven't even entered the dungeon yet. Oh, yeah.

Mhmm. Just Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Just just just just saying. I mean Oh, okay.

Probably fine, but I wasn't planning on going into the dungeon, honestly. So you're just planning on weathering the, okay. Okay. Oh, no. I figured I'd be dead by then.

We can That's fine. That's fine. That's if you guys ever move forward, we can just we can just t p k tonight. It's it's okay. Anyway, my turn?

Right. Okay. That's my turn. Yeah. Clark, did you pull on the runic weapon onto your character?

Did you say? Jason cast runic weapon on you. There's a spell effect runic weapon in the chat pulled onto your character. Yeah. It will give you a additional, that'll give you an additional, damage die when you swing.

Awesome. Yep. Alright. And speaking of Carson, you are up. What are you gonna do?

So for fun, as soon as you cast that spell, I'll scream, I got the power. Get him. Okay. If I can remember. There we go.

I'm on POS right by me, the little goblin guy, except for I forgot how to roll the die. There's I I know. I understand. Character sheet? On the character sheet.

Winter dawn. I don't know. Strike. Right? I think this is it.

I think I did it. There we go. Red team. Oh. Oh, man.

Really? You hit him? Yes. And Doesn't matter what your role is, love your hit. Mhmm.

Oh. I'll take 16. Boom. That's pretty good. Die.

Yeah. These these goblins, for those of you keeping track at home, they're dying at six plus. So Tell me their worth. Anything above anything above six hit points that you do to them, you're just completely overkilling. So they also would have heard us a little bit.

Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Yes. I mean, you can die for a thousand paper cuts.

Yeah. Their nights are sharp. I'm gonna go right there. That's my second action. Right?

And then I have one more action, and then I have to use that to raise my shield. Right? I want my shield. If you want to raise your shield, then, yeah, you would have to use your third action to raise your shield. I would like to chop this guy up, but I think I should just raise my shield.

Stand or valor. Stand or oh my god. It is that guy again. Raythellian. On the lion.

Ray the lion as you like to say. Oh, yeah. That's my plan. That was pretty good. Alright.

So the firing the firing line is going to continue to shoot, and it's gonna shoot at, the closest one which happens to be Karsten. Yeah. I figured. And I felt the power though. I told you.

Oh, cool. You had to miss. Yeah. Gonna continue, miss again, and continue, and miss again. Alright.

So you basically knock the you you knock the arrow the arrows, out of the air with your shield as they as they come sailing in. I can totally see myself doing that. I would also be screaming and taunting them. Oh, yeah. I mean, it's a Clark character, so that's just I do that in my this is I do that in my this is this is not a a serious, you know, contemplative, inward reflective character devoted to the highest This is I'm excited that we're picking some tail.

This dude hits with criticism every time. Wow. There's something going on with the, DMs rolling. I'm just saying. Yeah.

So that one basically runs up to the, the two got the two remaining goblins and the, with the bows over there and gives one of them and misses the other. Oh, that's unfortunate. That puts you in a pretty prone spot there. Well, it's going to be so far. That does put you in a prone spot.

You gotta be careful. Why is the guy that the guy should know that. He is a he is a sentinel, and he's a trained veteran. I mean, he's he's look at that. He's flanked now.

He should know better. Okay. He got the bloodlust. Come on, Ray the lion. Help us out.

Not so much. Oh, badly injured. Oh. Then this guy is going to Beep. Not smart.

It's a dumb move. I'm gonna be back. Create a diversion. Nice. Not do nothing.

So this this goblin hits, hits the, the dwarf and then makes a rude gesture at her. She seems unfazed. Yeah. Like a woman shouldn't be a battle. I get it.

That was his gesture? Uh-huh. I think he's a good jester. Right. Or she may not wanna watch replay this video again.

Just so you know. I really did. Uh-oh. Oh, that's good. Oh.

This guy's dead. Oh, we're up next. We're good. Then he pulls out a a light hammer and, oh, flings it at the oh, wrong button. Wrong button.

Oh, it's a good hit, though. Flings a hit. The, at the goblin misses. It was a good hit because it was doing it at his full attack focus. Oh.

Alright. At this point at this point, at the beginning or at the end of the round, there are more you you see you see through the tunnel that there are more there there's more movement coming in. There are definitely there's definitely more goblins that are heading in, your direction, and are looking to spread their wings and fly. Yeah. Now where you're up?

Where where are they coming from, Chris? The South or the North? The South. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Temple. So this is where the cave in was in the South? Wait. Oh, they Like, like, straight in front of us?

Hole. They broke a hole in that cave, and they're swarming then they're swarming the the temple. K. And then you would close the hole. That's what I'd scream.

Okay. Hour. Yeah. We're gonna move up, and I think I've got enough range here. Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, 30.

Yep. Exactly enough. So second first, same as the first. We're gonna target, these two here and hit them with the old The one two? Yeah.

The old Sparky Spark Electric Arc. Great. One failure. Absolute. Oh, that's okay.

Success. Alright. Uh-huh. Alright. Well, failure will kill anyway.

Failure is one, and ninety four is half. Alright. Alright. That's me. Alright.

Cool. Nice job. So the so one of the one of the goblins is Fricasied. The other one, has a, basically gets zotted and is kinda, like, jittering, but still, but still conscious. Mhmm.

Here, you're up. Slay the boom. Got a target first. Oh, now that's bad. You miss.

Oh. The ear never misses. Oh, he did this. I never missed. No.

I use I missed on my skin dry last time. You have to make sure. You, like, never miss. You missed twice. Chris, yeah.

Risk it for the guy. Go for the shoot for the move. We're going. Boom. There we go.

There we go. Jeez. Woo hoo. This guy will die with basically no rule. This goblin This guy just got my anger stare, and he died.

No. This goblin was basically you swung, you danced to one side, made it stand, and they sat you. You danced. You swung out again and I swept you. Grab him by the neck and slice him on top of the head, just right down the skull.

Yep. So he he sidestepped you, a second time, and then you you instead of dealing with it, you grab his neck and slice him in two Somehow. Or slice his head off or do something terrible. Yep. Alright.

That's me. Jeez. Alright. Gald is going to continue his air support. So he's going to shoot.

Front. Yeah. He's gonna shoot that guy, taking him, and he's gonna shoot the other guy, or maybe he's going to shoot the other guy. So to attempt to shoot the other guy. Oh, man.

Between the electric arc Yep. And his and his really bad shot, he, he was able to finish him off. Excellent. Now you you are definitely seeing that there are more, goblins heading in your direction. Gald Gald takes the, he's got one final, one final action.

He's gotta run forward, get down on one knee, and just get ready to get ready to continue to be firing into the into Goblin Mass. Uh-huh. And, both of the solar sentinels will, you know, also take you know, will their that's not their turn yet, so they're not gonna do nothing. Sameer, what are you doing? I am taking a good look at the temple and wondering about the merit of falling back in there to a more defensible position.

All the yeah. So, Okay. We've been in here before, so we kinda have an idea of the lay of the land. Right. So, yeah, I I guess that would So you run back to the temple?

I think I would make a call. Yeah. You know? Get get in the temple, bar the doors, and start getting out. Well, if we do that, we point at the stairs right behind us, can you just get to the village?

They don't seem to want the village. Well, true. And what exactly, Chris, like Yeah. So right in front of us. Right?

So, like, here, this used to be, like, cave wall and is now collapsed in. So is all this architecture in the very south due to us? The architecture itself is not. Like, basically, the cave wall was just beyond the end to the bottom of this map. Gotcha.

Okay. And, like, they the goblins have been attacking the village as well. Mhmm. So the whole they're not interested in the village is a bit of a leap. But Yeah.

Yeah. They want the temple. There's just some of them in the village and some of them down here. There yeah. When you guys did go down, there were there was actually Yeah.

There was evidence of a warband that was coming to attack the village as well. Yeah. So I like that going back, but I I think we just need to hit it head on and just crush them because I will be useless barricaded, and I don't know if we have enough archery power to Yeah. It's just yeah. It it offers cover, I guess, was the only other thought.

The gold, gold and the solar sentinels that are with you will call out, we'll hold the we'll hold the temple. You don't worry about it. K. Okay. If that's helpful if it's not helpful, then do do do your thing.

Yeah. I I mean, what's the objective then? Run into this hole with a 100 golems in it? Or wait for them to come out? Well, I mean, in all fairness That's what the solars were planning on.

In in all fairness, you guys were planning on going and figuring out where the goblins were coming from and attacking them and killing them. Yeah. Yeah. That really was that. So Just just because they got to it first doesn't mean that your objective fundamentally changed, does it?

Right. Right. Okay. Can we see where they're coming from inside this hole? The hole is kinda dark.

So you can see movement, but you can't really see, you can't really see how many of them there are or anything like that. Goblins have dark vision, so they don't need light. Alright. So, eventually, we're gonna have to go in there after them. Right?

Or wait for them to come out. Yes. I mean, you've got you guys could you guys could try and just hold the bridge or or go back to the coming because feel like they're just gonna keep coming because they're being spawned. Yeah. So Kill it with the source.

Alright. So yep. I'm move forward to start advancing on the Well, you shouldn't move forward, silly. I got a way to die. Well, yeah.

But you guys You think we're all moving forward, Clark? Oh, yeah. No point. You guys will be up ahead of me regardless. So Oh.

On movement, I don't I guess, I don't really have much else to do. I can I guess, I couldn't move again? Right? Do a double move? Yeah.

So put myself, put myself there, and then you guys will be able to catch up to me easy enough. Yeah. And and, really, at this point, guys, you do have the you do have the round because the things that are happening as far as, like, the more goblins are concerned, that's that happens at the end of every round. So Okay. And and you can you can, you know, you can plan on that because you've had the past couple of rounds for that.

I know it's a little bit meta gamey, but I just don't wanna slow everything down while people are being super cautious about moving forward because they don't wanna be caught out Mhmm. Caught out with their, you know, holding their you know what's it. So I wanna make sure I heal the, the sentinels because they took a ton of damage. If you do that, then you're going to have wasted your only focus spell on an NPC. Yeah.

I was looking to see if I had, like, a heal potion or something. Yeah. I have a heal potion. But okay. Well, heal potions, you can pass you can pass out.

That you know, that's that's the Right. But, yeah, just, you know pass them one of my heal potions. Healing potion, and I will lose it. Right? I just click zero?

Yeah. If you only add one, you'd remove it. Yep. Correct. Yeah.

The answer is I gave them a heal potion. However, you you can figure that part out. I love it. Yeah. I don't see that I have any.

Well, I didn't give you guys a ton of them, and I think you did use some of them. I gave you more than I gave you more than what they recommend. Yeah. And I don't know who got them. I probably was not one of them who I got I got one.

So Yeah. I only got one. So that's that's my move. That's all I got for my my set of actions. I take two movements to put myself in that position.

And, much as, Gold has done, I take a knee with, staff in the opposing hand. Cam. Stop it. Was it my turn? Sorry.

Should be. So I You do still have you do still have an action that you could spend, and you do have a shield spell that you could cast. Actually, you can I wanna cast that? If you got nothing better to do, always cast shield if you can. That's a man.

Do it. Oh. Alright. Alright. Carson, you are up.

Woo hoo. So I just drag that onto my character. I'm good. Yep. I'm gonna, I handed off that potion.

K. That's one action. And then I'm gonna move Jason, do you mind if I your not gonna hurt my feelings at all. Just block my view. That's all.

That's fine. That's two actions. And Or that is that right? That's your turn. But Oh, lonely.

You went 35 feet. You had to move into 25 feet. Okay. Two actions to get to where you're going. Oh, okay.

There. Sorry, Jason. Okay. I'm behind you. Oh, you're good.

Apparently, I can't move fast enough, and, oops. And I'm gonna raise my shield. Boom boom. There you go. What'd I do?

Did you heal that person? No. I gave him a potion. Gave him a potion. They can use it at their Yep.

Leisure. Right. That person is going to cough the potion given. Yay. So kind.

I want them to live. I know. She is going to move backwards to the choke point on the bridge, set her shield set her tower shield up, pull and have her hammer ready, and and yell, come on. Come on. Yeah.

That's right. And the other, the other, sentinel will do the same thing. He will pull out his shield because he was running around, you handing a weapon. But he'll pull out his shield, and he'll likewise set up in a defensive position. And Gold is behind with with, with race cover.

Okay. So before before we get very much further, how are you guys planning on moving forward with this? Like, are you what what what's the plan here? So, I can I can just kind of like hand wave our way through it because we don't necessarily need to go turn by turn at this point? For sure.

Unless you are unless you're gonna be again, unless you're gonna be, like, taking a couple turns to, you know, make it into the tunnel. If you do that, then we'll need to keep it initiative order because things are gonna happen. So I probably move up and then take a potion. How much does a potion heal you? It is a roll.

So the potions that you have, one d eight hit points. So do what? Roll one d eight? Yeah. Well, you can just go to your consumable go to your inventory where you see the whole the healing potion.

You click on that header. There's a use button. Just click on that. But so okay. So you guys are moving up a movement.

I thought our our mission was to stop. A movement range at a time? Stop these people. I did the the two that I could could really take. Okay.

I mean, technically, you don't have a mission. But I I yeah. I thought we were stopping the goblins. Confused by you guys. Yeah.

Yeah. That's it. We're stopping the goblins or whoever's leading them, at least down here. I thought that was it. I I think Chris is asking what formation do we want to be in when the next go waves of goblins appear.

Currently, we're setting up in our formation. I I can't go back. Up front. Can we, like Yeah. If if we get to the door, can we, like, what's that called?

Like, bottleneck them a little bit? Yes. You can. Yeah. But I was hoping.

There's the the entrance in and of itself is one second. The entrance in of itself is a 10 is a is a 10 foot a 10 foot square. Oh, yeah. Bottle knocking down would be perfect. They spread out, pretty heavily, when once they actually make it out.

So you could move up to the entrance and, and you would have a, you would have a a trip one sort of situation. I like that. What do the sorcerers think? That was my intention is to try and bottleneck them. If we don't do it in the temple, then we need to do it at the the cave.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Well, so good to me.

Where Which is which is where? At the bottom of the at the bottom of the map. Okay. As far as where at the bottom bottom of the map is concerned, it's yeah. It's basically right where Cahir is.

It's to it's where Cahir is and to the, and the square to the left Okay. Is where the, is where the bottleneck is. Right there. Get here. Get up here.

Yeah. So maybe we don't wanna be right in front of the entrance where they can shoot at us. I don't know. Maybe we're there? Oh, just a thought.

Let's do the side. So, I mean, technically, if they're that that would be an appropriate space. Alright. Cool. Alright.

That's Here, do you wanna come up here? I will also want to make my way up, but kind of off to the side here. Is this thing this thing here actually wall? Yes. Yeah.

Okay. Sick. Maybe Jason on the other side and Clark, two spaces left to me? Yeah. That's perfect.

And, we are at the hour mark, so everybody gets an additional hero form. Yeah. Here. Get your butt up here. Oh.

Ew. Ew. Right here. Nope. Right there?

One left. One left. Really? Oh, your other one. There we go.

There you go. There you go. Beautiful. I have the right shield. That way they don't have to come through the hole to actually get to the helix.

Okay. Okay. I'm picking peeking down the tunnel. You hear a, you hear a a heavy and deep voice, Oh, there we go. Saying, come on, runts.

Get moving. And with that, you have, a smattering of new goblins that are coming into town here. Oh, goody. Yeah. Checking range there.

Yeah. Right at the end of it. Woah. Oh, fireball. Yeah.

Don't you have that yet, Ramsey? No. Not I don't think I actually ever get it. Really? Not a See, it's a bit of a party.

Not Come on. Bards should be able to get that stuff. They could sing about get fired. I mean, I could. What?

Do what you do, Ramsey. Do what you do. Alright. I'll worry you up. Alright.

Well, oh, oh, I see it has become time for, the song to wear off, so we have to do that. That is priority numero uno. Mhmm. Because that is what we do. So we will use my second focus point to lingering composition.

I will make a performance check. I get plus one. Alright. Sick. So that's why I have four round courageous anthem, and then I will cast courageous anthem.

Yay. Right. So that was four rounds, you said? Yep. Oh, I can't drag out other people.

Okay. Everybody pull courageous anthem onto your character. How long does that last? Four rounds. Who?

One one round. That was a good one. Yeah. Well, it says one round because I haven't gotten around to updating it. Oh, I'm sorry, Chris.

I didn't know. Yeah. This is one of this is one of the this is one of the one of the few manual things that I actually have to do. None, unfortunately. I miscounted range.

I counted to the here rather than the roll behind. That's fine. We'll target this one guy, and we will storm the loot and have a little bit of electricity fly off of it and hit, that one unsuspecting gentleman. Oh, well. Ouch.

Okay. Even if he fails, that's not gonna do a whole lot. Even if he fails, he still lives, I think. Why am I sick of what? I'm trying to do, like, three things at the same time.

Alright? I love your patience. I love you, Chris. I feel like it right now. I I mistargeted a little bit.

Sorry about that, man. I was a patient anyway. Yeah. Alright. Sick.

Wow. Takes a point of damage. Wow. He, he scuffed his feet a little too hard and, and shocked himself when he touched the door. Mhmm.

Mhmm. Yeah. Well, that's all I got. Alright. Next up is Cahir.

Do I wanna step in front of the line of three to the right so I can hit two people possibly? I mean They're gonna try to kill me after this. They will. That is absolutely correct. Alright.

Let me just try to kill this guy. Yeah. Yeah. You can't split your movement action. Right.

Well, I can try to hit him first while I'm just standing here. Yep. Yep. Cool. Chris, this is rigged.

Oh, well, he'll die, I think. Most certainly. Yep. Alright. We have one more action.

Right? Or was that you only swung twice. That was my yeah. Stay right here and take it for the team, so I'll be done. Okay.

I'll have it sealed, do you? Nope. Alright. We got a gold. Okay.

Are you among these? Gold is going to back up. What? The the NPCs and gold told you to go ahead, they would cover the temple. So that's what they're doing.

Okay. Okay. And but he's got a long bow. So that means even at that range, he's able to take a shot. Sick.

Get him. Really? About a 120 foot? He's at a 120? Yeah.

He is five feet off. So he runs back. Oh, runs back to here because that's his that's his 100 foot range. And he misses. He's gonna shoot again.

That'll do. Oh, he can't. His second shot. He can't do a second shot. He moved twice.

Man. So, yep. That's that's Gold. Now it's Goldwyn's turn. Goldwyn's turn.

Oh, do I get an attack of opportunity? You don't have that ability. That's lame. Yeah. You have to get it.

Yet. Yes. Yeah. Being the operative word because I'm sure you will have it at one point. But currently, you do not have that ability.

Mhmm. He runs out, takes a few wild wild slashes at you. And had you not had your shield raised Oh. He would have been stabbed. Yeah.

So nice. His, his dog slicer glances off of your, she off of your shield. Good. That's good. Boom.

Now the goblin sturries out of the hole and goes for a, goes around, Cahir and hack, attack. He only gets one he gets one attack. No. He gets he can move, and if he moves within range, he can take two attacks. Oh, uh-huh.

He moves 35 feet. Move 35 feet. They can move, like, 50 or 45 feet. Came from here. Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, 20.

Oh, it was five, ten, fifteen, twenty five. So We'll diagonally Go from here. Go here. I'm sure he missed. 10, 25 twenty twenty five.

He he did it. Hey. You missed, which was sad. That's okay. Because this one is going to Point.

Attack. Uh-oh. Oh. He he he he makes it through your hide armor again, dealing eight points of damage to you. He takes a second attack and misses.

Boom. Eight damage. Wow. This guy We're surrounded. Is going to attack Karsten in a similar fashion.

Oh. He's going to miss on his first attack. That's right. He is gonna hit on the second attack. Do you need four points of damage to Karsten?

Oh. And, Sameer, you're up. Oh, Sameer, you're up. Do a little little magic little magic. This guy and this guy.

How do I how do I select two bad guys to attack? Hold on. Just Don't right click the second one. Oh, there you go. Perhaps he's the better person to answer that question.

I have a completely different process on my end. Oh, okay. Fair enough. Alright. So we will do Shift kill.

Yes. Shift kill. That's today. Yes. We'll do, a lovely little electric arc.

Okay. Yeah. Step on those two little dudes. K. So e we have one success.

Oh, that's The other one is a failure. So one success, one failure. Alright. Then I did damage. Yep.

Roll damage. Oh, that looks no good. Yeah. It does. Oh.

Found the underarm. Alright. Oh, whoops. Alright. And what are you doing with your third action?

Oh, that's not it. I was going to do a can't find it. How do you do the distracting thing? Oh, it's inside the, basic actions, which is the green button on your macro bar that has the hand shaking. You click on that.

There's a create a diversion in option in there with with distracting words or gestures, or trick. Okay. Yeah. So we'll do some distracting words. Okay.

Do I have to choose a target? I believe that you need to have yourself con you you need to have yourself selected for it. Oh, I'm gonna select myself. Yeah. Just distract myself.

I don't know how to do that. So create a diversion, distracting words. Oh, a six. Yep. So you, you did fail, but you did only fail by two.

So How do how do I know? Okay. It's Okay. Okay. Yeah.

It's it's it's something that I have on my end, but Mhmm. It's not displayed on yours. So Mhmm. I have done that, Chris. That's with my final action.

Yeah. Anybody can use distraction. Another thing that you could do is faint before you attack to get somebody to be flat footed, or, you know, I think they Demoralize? I think there are a couple other things for that. Demoralize.

Demoralize is another one. Yep. I'm gonna give that a go next next time. Alright. Oh, sorry, Clarkimus.

I was hoping I could alleviate one of them from your rear end. Yeah. Me too. Seems all I did was little light show on behind them. But they didn't recognize them then.

How do you You know? How do you know? How do you know it's lightning missed? Carefully, apparently. Seems to be a a better question maybe to ask how you make lightning hit.

Well, lightning here so here's the thing. Lightning always Lightning is lightning. It goes kinda where it lungs. It's just whether or not the it's just whether or not the, goblin is good enough to be able to get out of the way Alright. Before it fries him.

So, so goblin runs up to, Cahir, pulls out its dog slicer. Well, it already had his dog slicer open, and swings, hits, and does three points of damage. He always terrible. Okay. Here.

This goblin is gonna move over here. This little goblin went to the market. Target target Kihir and attack. And he's gonna miss, but he's gonna attack his second time. This time he hits for three points of damage.

Oh, here is getting visibly upset at the moment. Oh, you should. He wants to do a Sarlacc sweep, but he can't. Oh, yeah. Right?

Those abilities do exist in this game, just not at second level. Oh, no. At least I'm pretty sure. Alright. Level six.

Person in Europe. I am going to whack, this guy. Badly injured. Barely injured. Let's go with the barely injured.

I don't think it matters if you hit him. Yeah. Matters to me. You're pretty guaranteed to kill either one. Everybody was kung fu fighting.

See? He missed. Yeah. Hero point. Hero point.

Hero point. Yeah. Yeah. I think he's a hero point. Yeah.

He's well. How do I do that? Well, Well, if you were listening earlier, Jason had to he right, Glenn? Right here, it might reroll. Yeah.

Here we go. Here we go. Reroll to keep new result. Reroll to keep lower result. Reroll and keep the higher result.

Does that matter? It'd be reroll with hero point or something like that. Reroll with It says reroll with hero point. I don't see that. I'm right clicking.

Hello? Yeah. I'm looking at it. Okay. Reroll and keep new result, reroll and keep lower you have a hero point?

Yeah. I got where'd they go? I got two hero points. I haven't used any. Where'd they go?

I should have two. I'll give them to you. Wait. Time out on the hero points. Oh, are you sure?

Yeah. Okay. Wait. Wait. I have You didn't have any.

Look at He didn't have any, but those those get automatically added, which would imply that he either No. I clicked off them. I clicked them off. I didn't know it was part of the He didn't need hero points. He he's like, screw this stuff.

I don't need him. Okay. Nailed it. 23 does hit. Nice.

Then I'm gonna hit this other guy who just saw the light show. Yeah. The light show is a a precursor of the death that's coming. That's all. Oh, yeah.

Oh. And, is it? Yeah. Death. Nice.

Lionheart. Boom. And is my is my oh, my shield is not raised. Right. Better do it.

Great. If I move, I can't raise my shield. Right? Correct. Just raise the shield.

Okay. My final action, I will raise my shield. There. Alright. K.

This one's gonna move up to Karsten, and he's going to dog slice him twice. Idea to walk up to the to the blender and see how it goes. Gosh. He ain't that scary. Boom.

Oh, yeah. Oh, that's awesome. Good thing that shield was up. That's that's right. Yeah.

Where are you going? They're going to protect the temple, like they said. Joe. Okay. Even I knew that.

I knew it. I was just like, hey. Feels like they're doing this. Well Well, here we go. Away.

They're leaving you to take care of business while they maintain the safety. Oh, yeah. Oh, no. There's more goblins. Oh, yeah.

It's all coming together. Talking about. This is great. Well, the gears rather Surround. Surround.

That's right. Let's let's crush them. We gotta advance. Advance where? To the sewers.

Oh, we're good. We're we're gonna crush it. Yeah. Just give me one second. I I have to roll some initiative here.

I don't think they're gonna beat your initiative, but you never know. Alright. Alright. Alright. You're They they did not.

Alright. Alwar is going to move up to the front line. And as he does, he's going to whisper a little prayer, to Cadence. Protect me. And I'm going to cast a new spell.

I am going to cast Joe mama. Dizzying colors. I cast dizzying colors in, why why can't I do that? Place 15 foot cone. I would like to how do I manipulate this thing?

This is not the orientation. How does this I think it's shift and scroll wheel, maybe? Yes. Perfect. I would like to cast it in precisely where'd it go?

I had this figured out. Yes. Precisely this orientation. So I'm gonna hit those first five and none of my allies. Bam.

We need to all make will saving throws. Okay. Can you go ahead and target all of them as well? Yes. I absolutely can.

Just make things a little bit easier for me. I'm looking at It's like letting you target four. Yeah. I can't get that fifth one, and I'm not sure why. Okay.

Sick. Sick. Oh, that's gonna hurt. Oh. Oh, man.

That's so good. Wow. Come on, baby. Better use your stuff. Oh, that's so good.

One in success, four failures. So what? Two pretty fails. What was that? The one I I can't use anything.

The one that succeeded is only dazzled for a round. The ones who failed, though, are stunned one and blinded for a round, and the crit fails are stunned for a round and blinded for a minute. That's It's not. The one you didn't select. The one that passed was actually the was actually the first one.

Okay. Sick. So he is only dazzled, which is still a okay. The rest of them are fumar'd. Yeah.

Tested. We did. Nice job. That obviously makes them a lot easier to hit. Right?

But it makes it much harder for them to hit, I believe. So stunned will remove one of their actions. So they'll only have two actions on their next turn. Mhmm. And blinded, is blinded, which I forget exactly what it does, but they can't see, essentially.

So So I don't need to try to kill them right away. I should try to kill the ones to the right of me? Yeah. Probably. Yeah.

Especially, the one to your bottom right here, because this one goes right after you do. That other one goes after Samir. So there's a little bit more time. But, yeah, if you fill those two, that would be great. How do you know when they go?

Just click on them? If you hover over, like, at the top where the initiative tracker is, if you hover over above the initiative tracker, it'll light them up on the map. Oh, that's smart. Yep. Because when, you know, they're helping to choose targets is that can be helpful.

Hey. That's me. Okay. That's you. Oh, me.

Well, you have a roll of these real low numbers. Wow. They're rolling like me, dude. Alright. There you go.

That's better. I did use my hero point. You should do. Alright. That is.

Good. Nothing at all. Care. I think there's a lot of blood that landed on this guy, so we might as well try to kill him. Sure.

Oh, Chris, it looks like the one guy that I couldn't target for whatever reason didn't get or maybe I just can't see him and that's why. But I don't see status effects on him. Yeah. Like, I there. Can't do anything with him.

So I don't know what's going on with that. Oh, is it Is it the, the bug where I'm trying to remember. I thought there was a bug where if you spawn something where where the body was. Remember we ran into that? Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. That could be what's going on. It's possible. Nice.

Ah. You got both of them? Should be. Sir, which I will be right back. Did I not have him target to Chris?

There you go. You're working. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah.

I know. I'm just trying to fix a thing, but I I don't know. I don't know. Alright. So you swing and kill.

I missed him between there, but then I hit him on my third one. Yep. You got him? Yeah. Alright.

Next up is gold. He's going to to target this guy. That's the only guy that he can get to. I was hoping. Sniper shield.

Yeah. Did you get him? Oh, yeah. Nice. Alright.

Sameer, you're up. Oh, it's my turn. Get my character sheet out of the way here. Does that shield, spell require me to cast that, like, every round? Didn't I didn't see a duration on it.

Yeah. It's a duration of one round. Yep. K. That's what I was wanting to know.

Alright. I am gonna move myself, like, you know, here. There. Right behind my dear friend. So that's an action.

And then I will, continue with the oh, oh, oh, yeah. We'll do this guy, and we'll do this guy. Why aren't you doing it? That's the that's the goblin that just doesn't appear to work. Yeah.

That's the bogey goblin. Okay. Do I, do I need to avoid the bogey goblin, or do we go with the bogey goblin? You can go with the buggy goblin. I'll just have to remember.

Okay. So I'm gonna try and go with the buggy goblin. And the other one, we'll go ahead and do our lovely, Arctic Arc. Cellier and success. By a ton.

Right? That's Big damage. Bit better. Yeah. Alright.

So on the bright side, the, the one that was the buggy goblin. Yeah. Get out of here. He's just he's just dead. Yes.

Get him. You're doing great, Chris. Did pass. Oh, he's doing great. Oh, oh, I don't know.

Okay. Does it say he's bedazzled or just dazzled? But he can't tell the difference is my guess. Okay. So he takes three damage.

He is dazzled. The flat check was a success. So Okay. Is that me? I'm not sure why he's making the flat check there.

But Is it, I don't know. He still took the damage, so we are good. The car doesn't do that. Karsten, you are up. Slice him and dice him, bro.

Hit the guy in front of me. Boom. Boom. Oh. Knock you.

Answer it. Boom. I think he's dead. Boom. And I will move the fray.

I'll raise my shield. The fray. It's a good group. Couple of good songs. Okay.

This guy is not he's stuck in a tunnel. He'll go ahead and shoot at you here. Nope. I mean, shoot at all. Oh.

I'll do it. Seriously? Oh, alright. Well, he'll only hit him once. He'll hit him pretty dang good.

Yeah. How much? I didn't see him. Six points. That guy.

Too many dead bodies. No. No. Not enough. No.

You're I the yeah. It's yeah. It's a thing. There's no place for the dead bodies at this point. They're starting to pile up.

That's the problem. Yeah. Good job, Karsten. Yep. He would have hit, but he's blind and fails.

Nice job. He swings and hits the wall. I guess I believe that's how I to interpret that. I believe so as well. That is sick that it does all that automatically.

Yeah. This one is going to attempt to target Karsten as well. But, again, you know, not in Oh. Not in the best which way he's facing. Oh, this one's only dazzled.

Oh, it's enough, though. I would have missed anyway, but Yeah. Oh, and again? Oh, got him that time. Seriously?

Four points of damage. He's gonna swing. He's gonna do a wild swing that's totally gonna miss. Criticalness. He misses so bad.

Charge off. Carson, you're starting to feel pretty good. One's gonna charge off with its dog's last turn and see if it can get some gnome. Alright. He sure does.

He he gets some gnome again. Oh my gosh. However, Clark, for this one, you do have a reaction. That is true too. I do.

You got your champion's reaction? Yep. A guy you are in melee with just hit one of your allies. I believe that is your trigger. That is a trigger.

I am definitely triggered. Well, yeah. I would expect it. I suppose it's the is it the guy that's shiny? Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. And red team strike. That is a hit. Roll damage.

Goodbye. He is still up. Oh. What? He is special, John.

He is a bit downer near the Alright. Well, I suppose I'm gonna do the only sensible thing at this point. Run away. Turn it, everyone. Target these two, and we will hit them with the lightning fingers.

Oh, bayou. Watch your cart. Oh. Oh. Sad.

Well, hopefully, near death is good enough. Yeah. Really? Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. I am then going to do the only sensible thing to do with my third action. That's me. Gonna move?

Uh-huh. Right. Here. Oh, man. Go there.

Yeah. Wack him. You can't hit that guy. Well, that's one that's blinded too. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's good. Sorry.

Slow computer's slow. Computer's slow. Pretty weak crit, but Nice. Yep. Yep.

Alright. So that was one more action to go here. You got one more action. What you gotta do? Like, can I demoralize from that far away to be touching them?

I think it's, like, within 10 feet or something like that. So maybe? Demoralize. Yeah. It's it's 30 feet.

Oh, 30 feet? Okay. Yep. Yeah. You're like yellow at them.

So you, like, target somebody and then you go to demoralize? Yeah. Make sure that you've got your character selected when you click the when you click the macro button. Your character or the Your character. So you've got the you've got the target already targeted.

Now if you have your character selected, then it'll pull up the the information for your character. Maybe Yeah. Okay. Because I have a demoralized plus four. I don't know.

And then it just says boo. Do you do that? Yeah. You failed to demoralize. What?

There's a weak sauce. What drives to you? Sameer? Wouldn't hurt my feelings if I could heal people, you know? I really wouldn't.

Wow. So we were moving around trying to snag some people, What am I doing wrong? How can I not, like, move my guy? Because you're standing on top of a dead body. He's not Use your arrow keys.

What are you talking about? The bodies are piling up, people. They are. Okay. Well, anyway, there's a lot of dead bodies.

Yeah. I guess for what it's worth. I don't really I'm just gonna keep going with the electrical arc, you know. Why not? Sorry with the, changing grip thing.

I'm just running around trying to read some and figure it out. So Yeah. From that position, you're not gonna be able to actually see these goblins because they're down in tunnel. So you would need to reposition yourself if you're going to be doing the electric arc. Yeah.

I'm looking. You're you're making up to see them. Yeah. You do actually have to have line of sight. Sorry.

That's unfortunate. Alright. Yeah. I'll I'll do that. Liking the electricity.

Nice. Success. Big money. Big money. Oh, that's what you're doing.

Little 40 dude's been around for a while. He's pretty lucky little turd. You're right. Right. Yeah.

Alright. So they both take damage, but neither of them appear to be in immediate danger. Oh, they're in danger. That's Carson's turn. They're in danger.

Stick your sword right through them both and lift them up. Point to them. I'm a brat. It's a pretty violent way to go. I like it.

What? That's terrible. Terrible. Hey. I'm gonna use my, I'm gonna use my thingy.

That's dumb. It happens. That's still dumb. I don't know. Oh.

You trade blows with the government, but this one seems to be a little bit more resilient than the others. Oh. Oh, I'm a whack him again. Oh, yeah. You are.

There we go. Nice. Boom. He's dead now. You hit him with your shield?

What? Why'd you hit him with your shield? I I didn't. I don't know what that is. I did not hit him with my shield.

Yeah. You did. You did. It was a mobbing. I mean, you still killed it, but, yes, you hit it with your shield.

Oh, I didn't wanna hit him with your shield. Can't deny you can't deny what just happened here. We got we got See, I I didn't touch it, though. I literally did not touch it. I have no idea what happened.

Whoops it with your shield? I see. I hear that, and I see that, but I didn't do it. Someone stole my cursor. Could cut the gun and surf, and then, wham, shield bash to the face.

Oh, that's a big one. Alright. Another one's moving up. Hacking with the dog slicer. Yes.

Hacking with another dog slicer. And then, miss. Yeah. I just keep combat. Oh my gosh.

There are always more goblins. In general, there is not the stormtrooper rule, but in this specific instance There seems to be applicable. Alright. That'll work. Alright.

We will move the leap to here. Yep. That's 30 foot. That's also 30 foot somehow. Oh, I probably can't see that other guy, though.

I want to move one more over. That is acceptable. Yep. 30 foot, 25 foot. Perfect.

Bloop bloop. And more electric arc. Kill them all. Not a bad roll. No.

Not at all. We'll see how they do other saves. Mhmm. Also, these are beefier goblins. They might survive even if they fail.

Alright. Well, they're beefier now. They're succeeding. Number nine forty is still there. Good lord.

It's a turd. Alright. They're here. Does it make sense for me to try another healing potion, or how badly do you think I'm gonna die if I jump in there? Oh, yeah.

You potion, buddy. Peter is really slow. Sorry. It's okay. So one action, two action.

That's a miss. I'm gonna do the I do my hero point. Alright. That is it. Because that kills him.

Yes. Oh, Tom. I need to leave at ten, Chris. Okay. Well, as you guys enter into as you guys enter into the tunnel, you start to you start to get the sense that, there are some forces that are being marshaled, but you don't have a, but you don't have a good understanding of just exactly how many goblins there are.

But you do know that once you actually make it into the tunnel, it's a little bit easier to deal with because they don't have any like they have they're dealing with the same choke point issues that you are. The tunnel itself is very dark, and, more and it's cut of rough stone. And I am going to I'm gonna have that light thing. Don't I radiate light? You have to turn it on.

Unless it's dumb, I should turn it on. Oh. Make sure you here. The the the thing about the turning in the thing about turning it on is that you have, if if other people see you, then you're going to be, then you will be Oh, that's right. You'll be discovered.

So that's kind of one of the reasons why you don't just flip it on all willy nilly. But this is what we're going to do here. So we're gonna go ahead and, end this combat. As you guys press into the actual tunnel itself, You find yourself in a dark in a dark tunnel. The goblins are in front of you, and you have and you have a dim light that you're that you have from from the opening itself.

The actual, the actual tunnel, is looks like it's probably about ten, fifteen more feet before it opens up into some sort of cavern. And we're gonna initiate a different combat that we will pick up next time. Nice. Alright. When does the healing take place?
