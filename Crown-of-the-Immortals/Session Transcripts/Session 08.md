Automatic counter. Okay. Next. So you guys attacked the, there it is. Number one.

Two. You guys attacked the goblins led by the bugbear or the large hairy goblinoid creature. You defeated all of them, but while fighting Cahir fell. You were able to, save face or or you were able to, defeat the creatures and were able to revive here as well as heal yourselves up and give yourselves a little bit of a little bit of a breather before you ventured further. There were two tunnels that you were walking through, or two tunnels that were available to you.

One was a rough hewn tunnel that did not appear to have been traversed by any creature except one lone goblin that ran away. And the other was a more well traveled and well, and well hewn, tunnel. You decided to go after the straggler goblin. Moving through the tunnel, the uneven surface and sharp jagged rock walls, surrounded you. You were able to, there's nothing nothing jumped out at you in the tunnels or anything, but as you approached the end of the tunnel, an eerie green light started started popping out, started showing itself to you.

And you entered it or you got to the mouth of the cave, and you saw a you saw the goblin that was running from you dead on the shore of a large a large lake, a large Cave Lake. Also, the the eerie green, the eerie green light was emanating from a a bioluminescent algae that was floating on top of the water. And on a rock, out out towards the towards the, other shore of the lake, you see Cahir's sister Angel chained to a rock. Upon upon seeing you upon seeing you, she calls out to Cahir to save her. And that is where we left off.

And I'm gonna go ahead and pull y'all in. Yes. So Hello? We're all healed. Right?

Currently. Stop it. Whoever's messing with my sister is gonna die like I just did a few minutes ago. At least Alright. So At least stated.

So very quickly, I'm gonna go through everybody and get a reaction to the situation, and then we'll and then we'll proceed forward at that point. So, we'll go ahead and start with Sameer. What is your reaction to this situation? It's not real. Oh.

Okay. Carsten, what is your reaction to this situation? Why the freak is she over there? Like, kind of in disbelief, like, what's going on or what's really going on? Okay.

Our Oh, good question. We are okay. The edge of Cali Cave. Yeah. We we know this person.

We all know her. Yes. Yep. Okay. Okay.

I yeah. No. I think we're just gonna call out to her. You said Crystal? Angel.

What's her name? Angel. I one of those stripper names. Sorry to hear. Or yeah.

Are you allowed? Angel, my goodness. How do you get down here? Okay. And I'll start moving towards the water.

Okay. Good here. What's your reaction? Yeah. I'm kinda in disbelief of how she got down here past us, which we thought was the only way down here through the steps that we came down.

So Well, you do know you do know that the, town was under attack when you entered into the entered into the tunnel. So But she can handle herself a little bit, can't she? I mean, she's Not when she's chained to a rock? Well No. She didn't stop.

But I'm saying she could she could take out an orc or two. Oh. Or a goblin or two. Yeah. Yeah.

She's she's trained. So Okay. Can I do a tech magic? In this as well? Sure.

Okay. I I I clicked it in my little thing here. It didn't do anything. Do you see it? Oh, great.

Okay. No. So Oh, there it is. Yeah. So this is kind of like a radar.

It goes out 30 feet. And let's see where that that puts us. It's the 30 foot animation on Samir. Okay. So you do detect magic, but you detect magic on your compatriots and yourself.

Your detect magic doesn't really reach out all the way to where the rock is. That's a long way. Now, our, you said you were moving you're moving ahead. So Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

Go ahead and go ahead and, start moving that direction. I cannot. Maybe. It is paused. It is paused.

I would move toward her too. I'm okay. There you go. Figure out what the heck's going on. Can we all move?

Should be able to now. Alright. So Let's check out the dead guy. Really To the edge of the water. Kind of look at that first rock in front of me and be like, oh, I cannot jump the distance.

You're gonna have to toss me. Okay. So you guys move up. She, she does, she does call out and she's like, they they jumped me in the town. Hold me down into this place.

I don't know what I don't know what they're planning. Please save me. No. What do I got here? Can we see anything, like, southwest of us?

Like, can we see the whole lake pond, Cave Pond, Cave Lake? You can. The pond itself is covered with a high loo luminescent algae, though. It's really hard to see what's under the water. Okay.

We can see on the edges. I'd like to see if there would be, like, major disruptions, like, Right. Creature tracks or something. Yeah. Well, if you could I would if there were survival.

Okay. So maybe I'm not maybe I'm not explaining the urgency of the situation here. You're not He's gonna die. You have a chain you have your sister, one of your one of your compatriots sisters tied chained to a rock. God knows what's happening, and you're wanting to search for tracks.

Is that what I'm hearing? Mhmm. I just wanted to know if I could see I wanna I wanna see if there's any quick evidence that goblin ran away just fine. I don't think it even been hit, and now it's dead. Right.

I'd like to know what Again but, again, it adds more to the urgency of the sister being chained to a rock in the in that in that thing. But, yes, you can totally do that. So go ahead and move on to survival. Sister. I'm probably gonna be the one to jump out on the rock and try to swim through them.

I'm just trying to figure out what long jump means. Okay. No. And and if this is what you guys would do, if you're going to systematically move forward, then that's fine. It's just that, like, I'm this is a more urgent situation.

It's not just a it's not just a, it's not just a, oh, well, that's interesting sort of thing. So, she starts straining against the straining against the chains, trying to get trying to get to trying to get to you guys. Sameer, you don't see any immediate evidence of any tracks. So I'm trying to use the survival to look at the goblin and figure out, like, quickly what killed it. Why did it die?

Unclear. Okay. As I see Cahir moving towards the water as well, I'm gonna take out my rope and toss it and give it to him. Alright. Let me see.

Let me see if I can you jump. Yeah. That's what I was looking at too. So as just a leap, you can jump 10 feet horizontally if you have running speed. And if you want to jump further, it's an athletics check, d c 15, and you jump, that much to the nearest five feet.

Okay. Yeah. I was trying to figure that out too. I'm also not sure how, deep this water is. You could just walk it.

Who knows? Yeah. The well, the water yeah. And and it is kinda one of those things where it looks like it's a little bit deeper, but you're not sure. Again, you know, there's just un unclear.

So, Scott, if you want to go ahead I'm assuming you're gonna be doing a long jump or a leap. Right? Well, I figured I'd try to do off our first first round. Wait. 10 feet.

Oh, that's 10 feet. Yeah. I think I could try to swim to that one. Well, you can jump to that one. I can jump to that one?

Alright. Yep. Let's do that. Yeah. Well, I'll do my turn.

This long yeah. According to this, you can long jump 10 feet just by default. Yep. And I do have the quick jump feet, so I can use just high jump or long jump. I'll set.

Can I get a run start? Or yeah. Well, actually, that's what it is. Well, then shoot. At that point, you could jump to that rock, and then you could just do another you could try and attempt a long jump to jump to the rock that she's on.

Alright. Let's do it. So alright. So in the chat, there's an athletics, there's an athletics, call, call for a move, that I just put out there. Heck.

Oh. Yeah. That'll do. Over we go. Alright.

So basically, Kahiri, you jump you jump to this rock here, and then that's a 25 foot jump. So you just jump right onto the rock that Woah. Is Awesome. And as and as you ran by, I heard our was passing you a rope. So you probably grabbed the rope, jumped jumped, and are over there with the rope.

I only want I look at I look at Karsten and Sabir with the other end of the rope, and I'm like, I don't know what he's about to do, but I think everybody needs help. And I'm walk over there to help him. For poem or whatever. Yeah. You'll you'll be helpful for that.

I know. I mean, I'll do it again. As you land next to her, Angel says, oh, thank you, Cahir. Thank you so much. Okay.

Alright. What so what's what's what's the plan here? Is it possible to have to go around the lake? That's what I'm wondering. It is possible.

Then I go on the other side and need to throw her to her? Like, I guess I need to break the chains. Yeah. Right. So I have this axe.

So you start yeah. So you go, I might pull them out of sheer strength because I'm amazing. Okay. So you start hacking at the chains. Yep.

Let's hack them open. I don't think I carry my blowtor normally. Yeah. That'd burn. As you take a, as you take a, as you take a hack at the chains, you feel a, a sucker wrap its wrap its, tentacle y arm around your foot and yank.

Oh, no. I wonder. But it slips off. What slips off? Turn around and you see a creature, that looks like a hybrid goblin and squid.

What foul abomination created such a evil thing? As as you do as you discover that, let's go ahead and roll initiatives. Yeah. That's, like, Eldritch horror shit. Initiative.

That's some what? Eldritch horror. Like, Call of Cthulhu stuff. Yeah. Oh, okay.

Yeah. I call it Cthulhu. Now I'm with you. I know Cthulhu. I don't know outfits.

Oh, me? Anyway. Really? We're plus zero initiative? Probably.

Alright. Sick. That was all Wait. Wait. Wait.

Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

Crap. Initiative nature. I don't know how that happened. Hang on. Rewind.

Rewind. Rewind. Let's see. Clear initiative. There you go.

Excellent. I'll work. Try it again. Okay. Cool.

Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Oh, also, I forgot.

I have my, my feature. So I'm not actually going to roll initiative. We are going to, whatever this is, destabilize my time frame from my my chrono thing. So make just a, lap check. And my initiative is 20 plus whatever my modifier is, which I've lost my character sheet.

So I don't know. Skills. There we go. Bam. So my initiative just is 28.

No less performance. Where is the right skill? Where's perception? 25? Core skills?

Sure. I can't find my perception, but 25 sounds right. Your perception isn't a skill attribute. Yeah. That's correct.

That's correct. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a lot of dice.

Who are those people? For one person. Uh-huh. As you see one. Mhmm.

That is correct. You to find out. Yeah. Why is perception. There we go.

All right. All righty. Sick, sick, sick. Well, we're going to do the thing, that we, that we do actually, oddly enough to hear is first first. Oh, I got it.

Cool. Tahir's gonna do the thing that he always does. Yeah. Do, like, like, a million points of damage. Did you roll a 20, Scott?

What? 19. Awesome. 19? Okay.

Sick. You have a killer perception, my friend. Oh, yeah. He's an expert. Let's go ahead and target.

Oh, you're you use athletics as your initiative. Yeah. So the most of what what funky, because my default to today, and I'm not sure why. Yeah. Well, it's not much it's not much lower Yeah.

Yeah. Perception. You're you you're 27 instead of 20, instead of 28. So or '20 first. Six.

I think you still do, but let me just double check. I'll wear just one more time. Perception is so you're you're both 26 because I'll wear your perception is a six, not a five. Okay. So, in that case, I will go first if you do not mind Scott, and I will buff you before your attack.

Yep. So we're gonna do lingering composition. I'm going to make a performance check, equal to PC of my level. Seems pretty good. And then we will, create this anthem.

Everybody grab some create this anthem, and that will be a, assuming that was a crit success, that will be a four round create this anthem. Did that. Did on a character. I am then going to, bardic lore this this thing because I wanna know what are this. Skills.

Bardic lore. There we go. Babylance. So this is versus its specific lore. Holy cow.

Grap. Place her on fire. I'm hoping that you guys keep this to be intact. Right. But, man, I would like to know this thing's, lowest, defense.

Lowest defense. Okay. Okay. Its lowest defense is what if Ramsey, do you know what if there is a tie? Okay.

That goes to the runner. Up up to you. Alright. I'll say it's those defense is a will. Excellent.

Okay. So I will, so I pull out, my, my loot, I think I have. Play a little bit. Set up a courageous anthem. And then for my final action, I'm going to shield myself because there's not a whole lot I can do with a single interesting.

I don't know what that means, but fine. With a single, action. But I will yell out, attack its mind if you can't. That's me. Alright.

Here, you're up. Chris, do I have to click on rage? Like, it used to auto rage. Click it. When you rule your initiative, there's there's, yes, there's a rage effect that happens.

So you don't have to click on rage, but you have to pull the effect onto your character sheet. So when I click does anybody else have this? Like, when I click on a feat, it's they messes up my screen to where the top goes away. Uh-uh. Oh.

So I have to, like, re I have to re refresh? Right. Alright. Try that. Four.

It takes a minute to refresh. I'll go ahead and drop the rage on you while you're refreshing. Okay. Yeah. Please do.

Because anytime I click on something, it's messing my screen up. Like, the bottom half goes, like, to halfway up and then the top half's gone. This is weird. Okay. Your character sheet also has, like, three rages on it.

That's kinda weird. Okay. You should be good, man. Ramsey, when you say try to attack his mind, I should still try to hit him. Right?

Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't I don't think you have a whole lot of ways to to attack his mind. I'm not sure if, our other spellcasting friend does either.

But I can intimidate him, but that's about it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

I think that's gonna do a whole lot. I think. Oh my gosh. Big old hammer racks or whatever you have. We'll do the pre test as well.

Yeah. So you swing at him. But he as you were taken by surprise by him, you didn't quite have the footing that you would need in order to be able to I wanna use a hero point. Is that stupid? Nope.

No. Mhmm. Oh, they refresh. You use it now. Yeah.

Oh. Alright. That's a great deal. That is likely a squashed octopus thing. We I think you wanted to see how they, like How squishy it gets.

How much they can take. So, Scott, when you do make a critical hit, instead of rolling damage, roll the critical instead Oh. Oh, sorry. The critical button. Nice job.

Sorry. Oh, there we go. That's a better number. I kinda wanted to see the other one to see if it would kill it. We know the 32 will kill it.

Would 15 have killed it? Can we ask that? Wow. Hard to say? Hard to say.

Alright. Okay. So that's actually these buttons and pull this stuff and, like, pretend I'm testing it or something. I don't know what's happened. Sorry.

Alright. So That was my first action. I still wanna get my sister out of chains. Can you brave turn to yours you turn to your sister. Oh, shoot.

She's gone. And you see She's gone. She's gone. Zoom in here. What is that there?

That. That is inappropriate too. Inappropriate. You're a home. Your lover.

I don't think that's it. That should be possible. I, I think your sister got the bad genes, but I hate to break it to you. I know it. It's like She Princess Fiona there.

Jeez. Let's can we slice her still or no? Oh, yeah. Please do. And she's going to target you.

She started mumbling some some random incantation about poor unfortunate souls. And Jason was right. The freaks. I I assume this thing is not change. It is not.

Yeah. Yeah. No biggie. Man. Chris, we knew you were setting us up for a trap.

That's why we went slow. Well, I know that, and I know that you knew that it was happening, but your characters didn't know it. I know. We wanted to save the sister. Sister.

I I didn't. No. Alright, Peter. So she's gonna hack me. Scott, she starts mumbling Oh.

An incantation. I got a new I need you to make a fortitude save. I got a fortitude save. Is that hitting the button on the bottom? Mhmm.

Okay. Big money. Big money. Come on, baby. That's pretty good.

Oh, that is really good. Alright. You did succeed. Oh. Chris, you sound so upset.

No. He was. Yeah. This is so sad. It is disappointing, actually.

They like to die in a rock. No. When they're made. But you so your your body starts metamorphosizing. Oh.

You your your face starts elongating. You start to feel gills, you know, forming in your jawline. And you, you will you you basically through your own through your own fortitude, you basically will your body to stay in the in the same configuration that is. Oh, wow. However, you do have you do still have gills on your, That's right.

On on your neck. They're nonfunctional gills, but given the transformation that your body has been put in, you are sickened one. K. And then for her next trick. I must is this happening to the middle of Cahir's turn?

No. Cahir finished his turn. Oh, okay. No. He only took one action.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So So now this has happened yet.

You're what what are you doing? And your sister? I was gonna get my sister out of the chains, but my sister Alright. She's into a beastly woman. I thought you you you were successful in in breaking her free.

Oh, okay. Then she transforms into this lady. I'm sorry. I No. Good call, Ramsey.

I know. You got me. Well, no. I mean, I obviously wouldn't have tried to kill my sister. Obviously, she probably didn't transform until after my turn was over.

Right. Right. And I don't I see another thing, but I don't think I can do anything with it because I'm not gonna get in the water. So And she well, that thing didn't like, that thing appeared on its turn. So, like, I thought you were done, and there are two black eye turns before the next person's I mean, if I freed my sister, I probably would have tried to jump off the rock with her, but I'm assuming the crazy thing wouldn't have let me do that.

You could have grabbed her and jumped off the rock to the to the previous rock. That that could that would totally count. I would have probably gone is there a shore, like, 10 feet from where this rock is? Yeah. I probably would have gone back on the land.

But is it better for me to stay on the rock? Or I don't I don't think it is better one way or another. So I would wanna splashy distance. So, you know. So you could totally have jumped to shore with your sister, and then your sister turned into the big the big ugly thing and did its thing.

Yeah. I mean, I guess my character would have wanted to get to safety off the rock. You know. Okay. Yeah.

No. Absolutely. That makes sense. So yeah. And then she she does her she tries to transform you.

It doesn't work. He's gonna eat you as a fish. And then she lashes out with a with a claw. A claw? Oh.

Chooses who will stay and who will go. Why am I getting this shit? And she critically hits you. Oh, shit. Because barbarians are bit squishy.

Wow. Or 24 points of damage. Ow. Rick. Woah.

I don't think she's that strong. I think I just got critically hit pretty tough. That certainly did not help. Yeah. Then we have a another one of those squid like goblinoid creatures.

It will In yeah. So I'm afraid of It will gang up Anka here and bite him Alright, buddy. I don't know how to help you. For five points of damage. Then, I think that's all it can and it's gonna move away.

And next up is Sameer. Alright. But before we go too much further, we did also forget, Sameer's beginning of combat thing for the Wells Fargo Edge. Yep. Oh, I have yeah.

What do I do with that? I don't know what I'm talking about. Do I is there something I need to do with that? Yes. Also, beginning of combat, you'll make a DC six flat check.

So you just roll a d 20, essentially. I don't know if there is a flat check you could make this menu somewhere, but I don't think so. I so if I go down to the thing here and I just click the d 20 button, that'll give me a Yep. Yeah. Click the d 20, then click the roll button.

Six. That trade that that's a success. A d c six flat check. How is that a success? This is all a D c six.

Oh, yeah. Yep. Yep. And D c six does hit d c six? Yep.

So you randomly determine the level of spell slot you get back. You only have level one spell, so you get a level one spell slot back. You only have that spell for three rounds. And if you do not use it within three rounds, you experience a wellspring surge. So you have an extra spell slot for this encounter, which is sick.

That is that could be nice. Yeah. Let me find alright. I'll go ahead and add that spell slot on there. So now you've got you got it.

Okay. Alright. The menu is going nuts on me here and not letting me I get it went nuts. I can't close out half of my menu. So now I don't have any.

So is that what was going on with you, Scott, where the menu, like, jumped clear up into the top of the thing and half of it disappeared? Yeah. Okay. Right. Like, all those bottom, like, one through zero went to the halfway point in the screen.

Yeah. I guess refresh. That is weird. Yeah. Something about glitch there.

Alright. Yeah. I was wondering if you did that earlier, but I thought that I did some I I thought that what I did fixed it. Alright. We'll see if this refreshes.

It's it's taking its sweet time, but it's doing it. Okay. Sorry. No. It takes a minute.

Yeah. Alright. I was I was thinking about, a little frostbite. A little losses. What else I I do?

So Make the thing cold so I can run across. Gonna try and freeze that little Frostbite does not work like water rock water walker, unfortunately. I can give you a nice bridge. Alright. I think I have selected the target successfully.

I have clicked the frostbite button, and then I what else do I do then? I will Let's see. Is it so, who are you targeting? The, The little swimmer in the water. Okay.

I will have him roll the fortitude save, which he fails. He critically fails. Oh. So roll damage. Up in my previous screen there.

Yep. K. Saying base damage is acid. I'm gonna change that to cold, I'm assuming. Okay.

Okay. I think we're good. Oh, that's as good as it could get, only not. Okay. Very quickly failed, so it's double damage.

Also gains weakness, one. Good bludgeoning. That's helpful. Alright. Oh, And let's see.

I will Getting Can I do shield? Is that or is that a two action? That's a one action. No. It's a one action.

Mhmm. I will throw up a shield. Do you need to drag that onto my character or no? Yes. You do.

K. Alright. Perfect. Alright. Alright.

Two more come out. One comes out of the water and targets Alwer. I'm gonna roll. He's gonna attack with a tentacle. Yeah.

Nice. And I would also, I would also like to point out to certain champions in the group that your special ability that you need to remember just triggered. Just triggered. Yep. Yep.

Even though he missed? Your reactive strike always Oh, I got it. You you don't have a reactive strike. You have the champions, whatever. Yeah.

I think it triggers on attack, not hit necessarily. Triggers on attack. Yep. If anybody within your aura your yeah. Your retributive strike triggers on attack, not on hit.

So Yep. Alright. Here we go. Oh, mother. I'm gonna pound you.

Please do. Okay. Yeah. That's a hit. That'll do.

That seems pretty good. Oh. Oh, nice. Nope. Not bad.

That's better than my role. I'll take that. It's gonna turn around and it's gonna attack you for it. No. Why would he do that?

Because you just attacked him, and he's going to bite you. No. Nom nom. So let's see here. What's your, what what's your AC?

My AC Does it take a a penalty for, like, a second attack or something? It did. Yeah. Okay. It rolled a well well, actually, it doesn't matter what your AC is.

It rolled a 20. Oh, I got 20. I I don't know if I had my my my shield up during that time because I probably had it down. You haven't taken an action yet, so your shield is not currently up. But it did it was a critical was a critical hit.

So Baloney. Wow. 24 damage? Give me one second just to make sure that I did that correctly. Actually, you know what?

I'm gonna undo that. I'm gonna roll on the critical damage table just to make sure. Okay. Yeah. So I did do that incorrectly.

So you got hit for six points of damage, not 24. Oh, a lot better. All difference. It's just a little bit. Just just a little bit different.

Just just tiny bit. 24 points you down. It was like you nibble your leg and it fell off. Oh, no. It's And I'm badly insured.

Yeah. Yeah. You are. You're badly alone. That was a cue not to attack me.

No. This is Sorry. You're the only you're the only person that he could reach, so he's gonna attack you. He's gonna take a bite. What do you mean?

In blood. Actually, we'll go with a tentacle. Critical hit dead. He hits for two points of damage, but he's going to use his reaction to grab you. Uh-oh.

Now we're in a grappling scenario? Well, kind of. Except grappling doesn't exist here. I'm sure. No.

It it does. It does. But this is not real it's it's kind of a grappling situation because of the way that this creature works. Mhmm. So, Got a lot of stuff on that.

So when so this base, the this creature basically just kind of wraps itself around you, but because it's so small, it's not actually inhibiting your movement. It's just attached to you. Little suckers. Get it off. Get it off.

Latch on. So wherever you go, it goes. In Carson, Europe. We have to go in front of me. It's like a plan.

Let's see this thingy. Go down, here and here and whack a mole. And it worked. And it's always that hit. I was like, enter critical one.

Game, build money. Yeah. Click that critical one. Roll the critical one. Roll the critical one.

He didn't roll the critical one. He didn't enroll the critical one. Yeah. That was freaking terrible. Click the click the critical button.

Not the critical code. The what? You credit it. Click the critical button. Do we got it?

What critical button? Yeah. That's what I'm on. It's in the damage. I don't have it on your card, on your card where you attacked.

You see underneath your roll, there's a damage. And right next to it is critical. Click that one. Thank you. Definitely better.

But we Tell us, Elmer, you hit that one with 13 points of damage and it didn't die. I didn't hit anything for 13 damage. Oh. I certainly did. I hit it for three.

Okay. Carson, you still have two actions. I don't even know what to do. You you do have this I'm currently eating that water. You you do have this kinetics stability that allows you to summon flame and throw it.

Oh. That's Can I throw it all the way across the water or just hit that guy right here? Andrew guy. Oh, why don't you look at your, look at your character sheet. I'm going to do the same.

So you're gonna need to channel elements in order to be able to do that, so that'll cost you one action. But once you've channeled elements, you can do a a kinetics of the blast. Elemental blast. One action. Where's 10 for emanation?

Blah blah blah blah blah. Well, I I'm just gonna click some buttons just to figure out so 60 feet for the fire. Okay. Well, if it's within 60 feet, then you can throw it at the you can throw it at the other one or at anything really in the room, I think. Assuming here, let me measure where you are.

But I Yeah. Everything's within Oh, Oh, perfect. So I'm gonna hit everything's within 60 feet of you. And how do I select on? So you're going to have to channel elements before you can do any of your, any of your blast stuff.

So I'll cost one action. I don't know how to do that. You go to the actions menu and see and where you see channel elements, click channel elements. I'm using all the keywords when I'm when I'm telling you about things. Just listen to the keywords.

Now click apply effects. So it's not working. It's it is working. You're just clicking, clicking, clicking. Where am I supposed to see it?

In the In the in the chat. Everything is always in the chat. Wow. Everything. I found it.

Always in the chat. Alright. Now click apply effects. Alright. Okay.

So you have your aura. Now you have your elemental blast. Alright. And this is my last one. Fire throw a fireball.

It's it's my last attempt though. Right? The this will be your last action. It'll be Yeah. The multiple attack penalty still applies.

So you're not gonna use your plus nine. You're gonna be using your plus four. Oh, I'm not very good. It could have been better, but it's not, ah, I'm going to use my hero point. Okay.

Yeah, absolutely. Right. Click on the, on the chat thing. There's a reroll point. Yeah.

That's much better. Mhmm. Right. Which does in fact hits full damage. Not very much.

Holy Cross. Alright. So you fricassee some octopus that is currently hanging on to your buddy there. Mhmm. Alright.

Nice job. Yep. Hellwar, you're up. Alright. Sick.

We are going to, use this item I got, in, I believe, the temple last time, but I have not used yet. We're gonna use my blast boots for one action, which lets me, long jump for one action without, needing to stride first. And since we've determined, we can already go 10 feet. I will go 10 feet onto the rock. I'm gonna move over to this square here.

Oh, wait. No. I'm not gonna move over to that square there because that's another fricking action. Uh-oh. Hang on.

Oh, it's fine. They're they're still both in 30. Cool. Cool. Cool.

Cool. Cool. So I target this dude and this dude, and we will, strum the guitar or the lute really hard. And, as the sound goes out, it will kind of, like, crackle through the air and send to, our Sunday a bolt of shock at one that will then ricochet and hit the other one. And we will cast, electric arc.

Alright. Family amp. Cool. Nice. Alright.

Tell them both. Thank you. Alright. One success on the bill. Alrighty.

Feel good. Six, seven. Nice. That's the worst. I know.

That's about, you know, three times better than me. So that's nice. Seven and three. Okay. So that one is the failure.

Wait. Wrong one. That's success. That's failure. Alright.

One down. I'll take it. Oh, he's off. It's like a monkey off my back. Alright.

That's me. Alright. K. Here, you're up. Question.

Would it be stupid to use my, what's it called, Titan swing or something like that? I don't think so. K. I click that on my character sheet. Yep.

So just turn it on. K. Close that. Try to target beastly woman. Yep.

Also, keep in mind that you are currently sickened. Right. I don't think there's anything I can do about that. Right? No.

You can take an action to puke. So I don't think it's gonna matter. Well, I mean yeah. It so, like, basically, just just from a tactical perspective, right now, you're just kinda stuck where you're at. If you can kite her, just if you can kite her back to the group, you might be you might get, might get some additional support from Karsten.

But if you just smack her really hard right now and she drops, then you're in really good shape. The second makes it harder for you to reduces your attack by one. So if you're, it'll make it hard for you to hit and hard for you to crit. So and you're already down by one because of the clumsy, because you're a barbarian you're a giant instinct barbarian. So those are just some additional things to keep in mind.

So kick that off me then if I puke for an action? If you puke, you get to make a fortitude save in order to see if you remove the second condition. So it's not guaranteed. Let's try it. Hold on.

That's the only one action though. Right? Yeah. It's one action to puke. So roll fortitude.

From my character sheet? Yeah. Which is good enough. So you are removed from sickening. Yay.

Only just. You kind of feel a little bit busy in your stomach, but Right. You think you're gonna make it through. Alright. Alright.

I'm gonna try to hit it. 19. Like, that's Yes. We are. That's critical.

Oh, we like criticals. Let's see. Let's see when they're not against us. So the right guy I heard him look crazy. Oh my gosh.

Wow. Oh my gosh. Come on. Aw. Dude.

Wow. I don't I don't even understand. Gross. How is that possible? Wow.

My god. Me too. Alright. Well, it's a goo. It's a goo.

Is that is that the highest number? Stole my sister's identity. Alright. Tell you. Yeah.

So how how do you do this guy? How how do you kill her? I mean, I think the rage just overwhelms him because his sister has been metamorphosed. Right? And defiled into this sick creature, and he can't get it out of his head.

So he just slices her in two from top to back. Yeah. Oh my god. Gosh. Alright.

And that's your third action because you were tightened swinging. That's what did it. Yeah. Yeah. The extra d 12.

Yeah. Well, and and you rolled a 12 and a 10. Yeah. So that extra d 12 plus you're creating on top of that, that Wow. Maximum damage.

I mean, that was that was 44 points of damage just from your just from your roll. Wow. That's great. Wow. Nice.

I don't that's just break is that breaking the game? Like, 66 just seems like a lot. It's a lot. It's a whole lot. It is, but it isn't breaking the game.

Like, I I think that my, I think my Magus did he was only level two when he did 88, but You do it. I'm not. Yeah. But that was but that was like a max that was like the most that he could ever possibly do. And he created and it was an 88.

So it was pretty close to effectively what Kihir just did. Yeah. Wow. So it's it's How high could Kihir go? Is that a whole lot higher than that?

Yeah. That's about that's about it. He might be able to hit if he's got tight and swing up and he rolls max damage, then he's doing 70 points of damage. Okay. Up to 70.

Oh, yeah. So he can get up to 70. So he practically maxed out with that one. What was her defense? Like mine's 42 or whatever, and what's hers?

Oh, what's her hit points? Her hit points. Yes. Sorry. They were more than yours.

So that was a good crit. That was a good crit. Uh-huh. And the titan swing can only be used once. Right?

Well yeah. And you do have to make a, go ahead and you you do need to make a, a flat check. Roll d 20. You're looking for a six or above. Yep.

You can't use it multiple times, but there is an ever increasing chance of, back backlash. Yeah. Which is some negative thing depending on what it is. Yep. Did I hit the right button?

You did. And you are good. You you You did. You weren't overcome by the things. The the little squid creature then moves up to the island that Alwar is at and and attacks.

Mhmm. He's going to he's gonna spear you. I I dodge. I do not dodge. I dodge with my face.

Hold on. I like to dodge. In fact, we have a thing for this. Yes. We have a thing for this.

Oh, okay. I don't have that thing for this. I've definitely acted hostile towards that creature. I just zapped him. However, I'm gonna be taking for this.

Oh. I have my deviant ability. Oh, nice. I have an eerie flicker. Excellent.

Wood hit me. Cool. Alright. So I'll make my flat check. Bam o lamb.

Bam o lamb. That will happen regardless, but oh. Oh, lots bad. Well, I get backlash. So cool.

But and then I am concealed, for this attack. So he needs to make it easy five flat check to hit me. K. Does he do it? Yeah.

He does. Alright. He likes that's why I suffer two damage. I just wanted to use my thing. Damage.

Yeah. No. Absolutely. What's the what's the backlash? Backlash.

I don't know. I'm we're gonna look mine up. But, that that that, what is it called? Deviant? Gosh.

Why does it keep doing this? Deviant abilities. I'm sorry. Refreshing my Is the eerie is the eerie flicker, it's concealed for one round. Okay.

So, it is going to attempt to bite you bite you too. Excellent. So you are Maybe it'll work that time. Excuse me. Not this time either.

So it's going to gnaw on you for six additional points of damage. Sure. Rules. K. While he's looking that up, Samir, you are up.

Do I have to somehow specially designate that I am using my, whatever, mage spell, or can I just use the first rank spell and that's that? You can just use the first rank spell and it counts as it. Yep. Okay. May as well.

Yep. I better. Blast the living snow out of that thing. Fuck. Okay.

So thunder strike on that little guy. Alright. I need to show this one creature basic reflex. Alright. He's going to attempt to get out of the way.

He's going to succeed. I'll go ahead and roll damage. Yeah. He does. Woof.

He's a nimble little guy. You've rolled an 18. That's psycho. Roll damage. Still.

You still get damage. I just need to reset. Like, everything that I do when I Oh. It all comes up as odd, like, acid. So I gotta, like, reset everything to electricity.

It's it's not actually coming up as acid. Really? When I go to roll damage, that's what it's saying. That's a different part of the dialogue. That's like if you're adding additional damage to it Oh.

You choose what additional damage you're adding. So it automatically handles everything. It's doing that. It is automatically doing that, Yeah. That's not bad.

Good roll. Alright. So That's pretty good. The electric is eight. That's awesome.

And and three for Sonic. And how do you kill it? Block destruct. So it jumps out of the way, but The one of the one of the tendrils arcs off and snaps it a little bit anyway, but the concussive force of the of the thunderbolt just pounds it. Into the rock or something?

Yeah. Sure. Nice. Goes to jump and suddenly changes direction abruptly in the opposite direction. I get to hit Elwert's pointy hat and die.

Alright. Yay. We have succeeded. We have a very a very hurt to hear. Uh-huh.

In many ways. Yeah. Great. Very very emotionally wounded to hear and psychologically traumatized. And Yeah.

Yeah. Alright. I'm gonna You can get your hip bone so bloody high. Oh my gosh. Why am I such a pansy?

Yeah. And you were the only way to answer that? That rope, that I assume Karsha still has the other end of had pulled myself to shore. So those those rocket boots were a one and done. One and done?

Yeah. Yeah. They weren't suitable. I was worried it was worth it. It was.

That was a good use. There we go. Boop. Okay. So, what as you guys are kind of licking your wounds, taking taking, we're gonna go ahead and add an additional hero point because we are at that time.

You happen you happen across a few things in the, on on the bodies. Oh. They are you find, some triangular teeth. They resemble a shark's teeth, and they are on the body of the, of the old of the old lady with webbed feet. Each one of the little squid creatures has a healing potion.

Oh, good. The old lady also has a leveling scale Oh. A choker arm mutagen Oh, yeah. A scroll of wyrms repast Oh. And a lesser healing potion.

Oh. All of those things can be found in your party stash right now. Excellent. Excellent. This is a lot of stuff.

That is we like stuff. Yeah. Stuff is good. There's no complaining about that stuff. Oh, yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Party stash. Yeah.

So if you go to your, if you go to the actors section, there's a little Ah. There's a little sheet next to the party. Open that, and then you'll have, like, the party overview. And over to the right hand part, there's a stash section. If you happen to be on the on the home screen, the party the the party button on the home screen will also get you to, that party thing.

Something I gotta refresh my computer. Oh, those triangular teeth might be good for our barbarian friend. Mutagen for anyone melee probably. How does it do exactly? Plus one to acrobatics.

Oh, increase your reach by five feet. Oh, that's real good for either of you melee peoples. Yeah. I don't know. That choker arm mutagen, it's a consumable, but for basically the fight, it gives you five foot of reach, which is real good.

Kahir, I think you should take it. What kind of scroll is this, Chris? It is a spell scroll. Yes. Yes.

Yes. Sorry. Which, what about who is it? Arcane, Primal, Occult? Oh, it is a cult.

Okay. Excellent. How do you how do you take them? How do you move them? Well, I don't know.

Just just pull them onto your character sheet. Oh. You go left, you know. Right. Okay.

Yeah. I believe I'm the only one who could use a cult spells. So I will take the scroll if that is okay. I think, Cahir, you should take the, healing potions. Which one's better?

Well, I don't wanna take them all. But You seem to need them more than anybody else. The the lesser healing potion is the is the best of the batch. The other ones heal one d eight. The lesser healing potion heals two d eight plus five.

So Alright. I'll take the big one and one of the small ones. Oh, okay. My bulk's getting to be big. There we go.

Granger. Oh. So are Kahir, are you going to just be rock hopping back to the group, or are you planning on going around the lake? Depends if they're coming to me or not. I never found a party stash because I'm a moron.

Okay. So if you go to the the actors section, so the little little person in the in the chat in the chat, up top. There's a little person thing. Right. You click on that, you'll see a section called party.

And right next to the party, you'll see a thing that looks like a sheet. If you click on that sheet, it'll open Sheet. Your party. It'll open your party, dialogue. And then on the far left, there's a stash tab.

Click on that. Yeah. I gotcha. Alright. Thank you.

Are you guys gonna take the other healing potions, or is that I'm just seeing myself right now? No. No. We're in we're in downtime. Don't use them now.

We've got a pallet in for that. Yeah. I should take all the healing potions. I don't I think having one each may not be the worst idea. So if anything does happen to one of us, anyone else can get them up.

Yep. Yeah. That's what I was thinking. So there's Nothing worse than trying to rough nothing worse than trying to ruffle through, somebody else's pockets to try and find their healing potion to shove it down their throat. If they don't have one.

Yeah. Yeah. I I I can do some lay on hands. Is that okay? Oh, for sure.

Yes. Yes, please. Yeah. I should. Alright.

So I will snag a healing potion. Alright. I got one. Yeah. This bubbling scale lets somebody breathe underwater for a long time, which could be useful, but I don't know if it's necessarily the most useful for anyone in particular.

We can just hang on and do it until we need it. Right. Chris, can I run around to try to go get him? I think, Kachir, you should move. Well, no.

That if if you guys are going around the lake, then I have things that I have to that I have things that I have to describe. If you guys are not going around the lake, then I'm going to hold off on that. So I'm I'm waiting for somebody to make a decision about whether or not you're going to York or York's going to you or if you're just hop, skipping, and jumping. I'll try to jump over there. That'll be easier.

Alright. So you head back to the group. Yep. I mean, it's it's all fine no matter where you wanted to do, what what you wanted to do, and that kind of thing. I just it just depends because this is a big cavern.

Shit could go down. Yeah. Yeah. It took the bubbling scale just to get it Yep. On a body.

I don't know if that's what I was supposed to do or not, but Oh, it's fine. It was fine. You did it? It's fine. Apparently.

Okay. I can't send it back. I don't think so. You can drop it back in party stash. That's fine if you wanted to.

Alright. So as you guys are you guys, are, you know, just kinda getting getting powwowed and healed up. See how much how much time, I'd be like, did you see what happened to my sister? It's totally fueled by that. Yeah.

Me too. I was just happy to make the jump. I started just like her. She knew your babe too. That was weird.

That was weird. Yeah. That was a weird part. Must have been in your mind. Albert, can you roll in a cult for me?

Yeah. Absolutely. Cultism. Oh, yeah. Alright.

You have a suspicion about what all of these things were. I think you probably were able to identify the the small creatures, based off of your previous role. I think that includes identification as well as I think so. Yeah. So the little squid goblin type creatures are creatures known as grindilo.

They are generally found in cold, dark, spaces and are in like to, like to hunt in hunt in packs. The creature that was Angel, you suspect, may have been a hag of some kind. Oh, yeah. Definitely was in your mind then. What do I know about hags, Chris?

Because I actually don't know because I'm not I don't know if they're different from other hags. But there's one thing in particular that Ramsay knows about most hags, and that is that they like to be in covets. That is correct. In in general, hags do do, kind of group together, and they don't group together in, like, the the same sort of hag. They kind of have specializations, and they don't really like to, you know, they they don't like to work with other creatures that, mess with their stuff.

Mhmm. They are rumored to be very, they are rumored to be very, territorial. And, yeah, generally travel in groups, although they don't usually enlist lesser beings like Grindylo as their, as their followers. So this is kind of a bit of a weird thing. But, yeah.

The it's basically the the general, like, concept of, it's it's the general concept of of, you know, the European witches kind of thing where you have a cover and the cover and you have they generally have covenants and covenants make them each more powerful and that kind of a thing. Correct. So Yeah. It may not be the last one of those we find down here. It'll probably be different, but similar.

David, I always mask their identity though? In general. Yes. Yeah. In in like, our you you would know, like, an example, Ramsey, you would know, and this is something that you can internalize for our work.

Like the, the Hansel and Gretel witch is a hag. And by this definition, the sea hag, which is what you were currently facing, was modeled after Ursula in, in The Little Mermaid. So, like, they're they generally, all of them have the ability to change shape, transform into something that is more appetizing, or not appetizing, but more welcoming to outsiders, so that they can lure their victims in. K. Okay.

With a fishing pole. They're usually pretty powerful spellcasters. They do like the to transform like that. So if we see someone else that looks harmless in a descent, be careful. I'm just working on focusing on healing.

Alright. One for Outwater. I think That's everybody. Isn't it? Yeah.

K. So how many times did you lay on hands, Mark? Not enough. One for me, two for Alwar, and, I I don't know how many for None for me. None for you.

And then I think four or five for Okay. So that sounds to me like an hour and an hour and a half has passed. Oh. While you guys were getting healed back up. Oh.

Okay. So as Carson's, as Carson is going around and, you know, healing everybody, is there anything specifically that anybody else is wanting to do other than just focus on making sure that you have all your fingers and toes, to focus on? I'll be going to refocus and get my focus point back that I spent. Fair enough. But beyond that, I don't have a whole lot else to do.

I don't either. And, and oddly enough, so, Arstan, since you opened since you opened the fire gate, you basically have this fiery aura around you. Oh. And you continue to have it for as long as you want. It's an unlimited duration.

But it's basically like you have flames just kinda licking around you. The the air around you is slightly warmer than the air around than the air in the in the in the cavern. So you have a Hey. A neat little thing there. So you'll be able to channel elements.

You'll be able to continually channel elements on that. So as you guys are, you know, just kinda getting getting your bearings, the water itself does not move after having defeated the the Grundilo and the and the SeaHag. You do notice that, the, there's a couple of there are a couple of tunnels that are going away from, the away from the, the lake. There's one that's just across the way, and then there is one, a little bit further south that appears to be going back the way that you came from. In the distance, you also see a blue glow coming from a coming from the top of a cliff edge in the far south of the cavern.

Okay. Look like we can go. We can't go north. Mostly around the lake. Yeah.

To the north, there's basically just the the water goes up to the edge of the cavern and just kinda sits there. So there's there's the the north is you you're at the top of the the top of the cavern. Mhmm. Well, unless we all wanna go over a swim, we should at least go south to the end of the lake here. Yep.

Be great for you. Alright. So you head south. I love you. What is that?

Excuse me. Try not to get too far ahead here. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

Jason slash follows. Some darkness. I probably can't fall. Yep. So as you continue further south, you do start to see that there is also another, there's another alcove, or cave, cave opening to the west, as well.

But you're not really sure what's what's inside there either. Okay. Should we close one here or a different one? I mean, well, there's this. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. But there's also another cave opening for here. Oh, okay. Okay.

Okay. So you don't really get to you don't really, you know, you're not seeing seeing it because your light doesn't travel that far. But you do see that it's not as not as light there. Now, as you get closer to that section there Okay. I'm gonna go ahead and pause right now because some things some things are, happening.

I would like people to make perception tests, please. We're bang. Perception is not a skill. It is an attribute. Got it.

This water is pretty, guys. Check it out. There is no encounter. What I gotta do? Perception.

I I do recognize the bodies in the water. I I can't I got it on the thing. Oh, I gotta redo my thing. Pure perception good. Oh, I didn't see your role.

That's not good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I saw this this water.

It looks pretty. Check it out, guys. Sorry. I found this cool rock. Alright.

I'm back. Alright. Sorry. So there's pretty water. I need people I need people to roll protection tests right now.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So And your character. Is Jason and Carson.

Okay. Carson rolled his. Samir, we're waiting on yours. Perception? Yes.

Perception is not a skill. Oh. Perception is an attribute. Yeah. So tell me there's no active encounter.

What am I doing wrong? Go to your character sheet. I have to do it to my character sheet. That's where I always do it on the front panel. There if enter the attributes, there's two perceptions.

There's the one perception that's in the list of blue things, and then there's a perception at the bottom. So if you scroll to the bottom of the attributes in the in the menu and click the black perception, not the blue perception, that should roll it for you. Okay. That's the one we're looking for then. All right.

They're just lying to me because there's even one. Yeah. I'm still in the bathroom. Water is great. Water just as much as that were.

So beer and I are bonded over this cool rock. We found. Yeah. Good Lord. Right.

So, Kihir, there is something that you you know you notice there's movement happening in the tunnel over here. To our right? Yes. Well, not your right, but, you know, your character's left, but your your right. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Map. To the to the cardinal direction of the east.

East. Okay. Okay. Hey, guys. Quit looking at the stone.

There's stuff happening. What? No. I got away. Alright.

The stone glows. I say we'd go check it out. Right behind you. Alright. You guys charge into the tunnel?

I mean, I'm bright light, so you can see, right? Yeah. Freak. We are kind of out of low in a little bit. We are.

Yep. Alright. So you move into the tunnel, and what you see it you see a a goblin running up the tunnel, as if he heard a loud noise. And next to him is a dog like creature. It's not quite a dog.

It's not quite a rat. It kinda looks like a hybrid dog rat sort of thing. A chihuahua. Oh, that's not a chihuahua. It's definitely not a chihuahua.

It's not an auto US either. That's kind of an ROUs, but Sure. Yeah. So the goblin warriors running alongside that, and they are chasing and they and they are running towards the entrance. Okay.

So running away from us? No. They're running towards. Towards us. Okay.

Okay. Yeah. So it's still a big block of black here? Yes. Okay.

Alright. Yeah. I'm I'm describing that so that you guys can react to it before I start revealing things. Because if I just start revealing things then maybe maybe you're just gonna be maybe you're just gonna, you know Run away. Do something else.

Yeah. Hell yeah. So you yeah. You see that the goblin and the rat moving up moving up the tunnel. What do you guys do?

Do you do you charge at it? Do you run away? Do you do something else? What what are you what's your, what's your reaction to this? I would like to stand like, I'm embracing to lash.

I don't wanna go in there, but if they're coming to us, then I'm just gonna get ready for a brawl. Does that make sense? You said it's it's running from something? No. It's running to something.

It's like you know, if you were if you were on guard duty and you heard a loud noise and you're you're running towards that noise Right. That's that's effectively what you're what you're seeing happen. Yeah. I'd say with, with, with Carson, kinda being in a defensive position, I'll just do a similar thing. I'll pull up my my instrument and, start getting ready.

But besides that, I'll stand firm. Alright. So let's go ahead and down the tunnel. I think we could go a little further. Can we go a little bit further in there?

If you yeah. If you want to, I'm giving you one I'm giving you effectively one action to to set yourselves up before the before the goblins before we start initiative. So use your one action the way that you want to. Excellent. And raise and firm back.

Sure. They're moving up. I will also move up a little bit. Here we go. Just slam near the group.

Alright. Target. Go ahead and roll some of that beautiful bean footage. Alright. Oh, wow.

Oh, you guys moved all the way up there, Okay. Yeah. Follow follow suit. Not really what I was going for, but You can do you, man. Yeah.

If they're gonna encounter there, I'd wanna be able to at least have line of sight. Oh, fair enough. That's what me doing me would be. Right. Carson Alwer.

Sorry. I am that. Oh, cool. Initiatives. Yes.

Yes. Alright. Sick. We will destabilize that time stream. Sick.

So yep. '26. Alright. Since I passed. You passed.

Passed initiative. Alright. Carson? Can I hold my action? You still need to roll initiative.

Oh, that's close. You know? You can hold your action all you want, but you still need to roll initiative. What's he holding? You.

Oh, hey. Finally. I've been getting shiny initiative roles. Alright. That was pretty fantastic.

This is gonna make mine that was really awesome. Look pretty bad. Alright. So I will. Yep.

Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. But we will, do the normal thing.

We'll start strong and the loot, do the lingering composition. Not as good this time. 14. So this is a, standard difficulty DC by level, which DC by level. I don't actually level by DC.

Level two is 16, so that is actually a fail. Oh. So, this is not mine. So it doesn't, no. It's fine.

That's it's totally fine. No. No. No. No.

It's it's fine. So I don't lose the focus point if I fail is the big thing. So it's whatever. I still will do the greatest anthem. It will just only last for a round, but I can just do it again next round.

Like, whatever. It's not a big deal. And then I will also, oh, we're not in range of arc. I can't get in range of arc. These guys have seen us, I assume.

Yes. You are currently beacons of light. So Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Kinda hard to not see you. That makes sense. Create a diversion.

Oh, it doesn't help, does it? What does this do? Hang on. Wait. Just see real quick.

What does created a diversion do? We're gonna succeed. Success. Oh, I'll be I become hidden. That's fine.

That doesn't matter. We're not gonna do that then. I don't know what else to do. Let's, yeah. No.

No. Let's do the let's do the thing. We will Bardic lore, these creatures. Yeah. Okay.

We'll get some information. That seems like a good idea. Alright. So skills, goblin first. Where is my bardic lore?

There it is. Bardic lore. Bam. And then I will also Bartic Lore the doggo second. And that is oh, neither one of those is good.

12 to 13. That's first as their specific lore, but I imagine both of those still fail. Let's see here. No. I'm not really sure what their specific lore is.

What do you know what is it, like, class DC or something? Or No. So at least when I was had the tabletop, like, it would have, like, the the knowledge DCs, and one of them would be a lore. It'd be like this lore has a DC, and then it would have, like, generic Archon or whatever. It would have another ace another DC.

Okay. Yeah. Neither one of them hits it. Yep. It's okay.

Sick. I don't know if it it's a goblin and a rat dog. Get them. That's my turn. Also, everybody don't forget to grab the, greatest anthem.

Well, actually, we've got applicable lord d c 13 easy. Okay. Easy or very easy before testing. Well, I'll give you I'll give you a name of the name of the the creature. So you've got Sure.

The goblin warrior from which you already know. The other creature's name is that it's a goblin dog. Ah, well, that makes sense. Yeah. Okay.

Oh, mother. That's a big dog too. The dog is bigger than the goblin. Yeah. It is.

Woof. Alright. Yeah. The speaking of the goblin dog, it is its turn. But when it sees you when it sees you guys, it just, like, kinda holds up real quick and looks to its handler as if for instructions.

Okay. Sameer, you're up. I never pulled this effect. I need to Okay. It's holding its turn.

DC20 for the splinting of the spell stuff. Right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yep. So it's just DC6.

Uh-oh. Another one. Look at that. Oh, wow. On the bright side, I don't think you lose a spell slot.

So Well, that's correct. What was the But does that cause a that cause a wild surge? Or it sure does. I'm pretty sure. It does?

Wellspring. Beige archetype. Yep. You generated Wellspring surge. The spell level chosen randomly is what's, well, first level Wellspring surge.

Alright. So make a you have a roll another d 20 that says Oh, come on. Seriously? Well, that's either gonna be real good or real bad. Let's see here.

It's just, like, why would you roll a 19 on this? Oh, okay. Save it for something useful, for Jesus' sake. It's fine. It is.

It's just Really? Totally crazy. Okay. And that stupid thing did it again. Oh my gosh.

K. I'm just gonna Salesman searches. Here we go. You rolled a 19. Okay.

Well, that's interesting. Could be could be worse. Or it could be a lot worse. Yeah. A sudden downpour.

Evocation water, water cascades from actually, let me just copy and see if I can paste it in here. Sudden downpour, water cascades from above putting out non magical fires in 10 foot bursts attempting to counter counteract magical fires. Oh. So suddenly in the middle of the cave, a there's a giant, there's a giant torrential downpour rainstorm. Yeah.

Which is, which is really fitting for me. I like it. It's probably not to get wet. Right? Thankfully we don't have torches though, so this is good.

However, it is messing with Carson's little fiery flaming self. Yeah. That's fine. I look pretty hideous. I think I look pretty good.

Alright, Carson. Oh, no. Wait. Sameer, so you did a so it's still your turn. You have done anything.

Right. Yep. Yep. Right. I'm gonna do flurry of claws.

Oh. How far out am I? It's like 45 feet to the doggo. So I gotta do that as a reach spell. Okay.

I think. So reach takes an action. Right? Mhmm. Yes.

Do I need to do anything? Nope. You just spend the action. Okay. Yeah.

You just spend the action when your next, your next spell has double the range or, you know, spell has a range that increases the spell's range by 30 feet. Excellent. So I believe that yeah. I know. I'm just trying to read it.

I don't know why when I click on it, it so it just opened up and let me read it. Yeah. Range is 30 feet. Targets two. Okay.

So, I will target. And then is it shift target or control target for the second one? I think it's like shift shift. Yeah. K.

Here you go. So you're about to drop the pain. It says I don't have focus spell points, which is not true. I haven't used a focus spell. You just need to re Hit a little button.

Focus. Yep. So go into your spell section. There's a focus there's a focus spell section. It says zero out of one.

If you just push press the plus button, that will recharge it. Okay. There you go. Okay. There you go.

Yeah. Perfect. Now do it. Alright. And roll your attack.

That would be three of them in the last two minutes. You do have a hero point. Yeah. Yeah. And there's no reason not to use it.

Agreed. Where is said hero fight hiding? Heard that right now. In the roller key button that says reroll hero point, I think. Right, Chris?

Yeah. Yeah. So on your on the card where it says credit bonus, if you just right click on that, there there's a drop down and there's a reroll using hero point option. Click on that. Gotcha.

Done. That's a significant improvement. Yes. So that will definitely hit both of them. Under I understand.

Damage. Roll damage. Okay. Whatever. Not bad.

Okay. All things considered. Yeah. Neither one of them neither one of them you created on, but Woah. Woah.

You did you did slice open the goblin warrior. No ice. Well, he's always used for his handler for a while. Right? Right.

Right. Nice job. Yeah. So Become his handler. So what some some ghostly dragon claws appear out of nowhere or some thunder clouds drops under the claws?

What what what happens? Starts raining. And Yeah. It really is, like, yeah, a set of a set of claws. And I guess I envisioned that it was just, like, raking the back of each of them.

So Okay. Yep. Pretty pretty massive, in this case. Yeah. Dragon dragon claws.

Alright. Also, you did use blood magic here. So Oh, no. That means you because you use your blood magic, you your blood magic effect takes takes effect as well. So you have you can pull the scaly hide effect onto your token, and you get a plus one AC for for the duration of your round of the round.

Oh, that's cool. Yeah. And I would also like to point out that shield happens to be a blood magic effect for you. So every time you cast shield, you get a plus two AC, not a plus one. Okay.

That's something that Are you talking to me? Keep in mind. No. No. I won't follow-up.

I'm not talking to you. Oh, where do I find Alright. It's if you go up to the flurry of clause entry in the in the, in the chat, there's a blood magic effect or blood magic scaly hide. Oh. You just drag and drop that.

Drag that and drop it on me. Yep. Sweet. Okay. Yeah.

So that stacks with, a shield. Yes. It does. Okay. You know, it's like one of the only ways of being able to get a plus two from a shield.

So Mhmm. It's pretty nice. Yeah. Okay. Thanks.

Karsten, you're up. I don't really wanna move. Well, you could always try and shoot a fireball that in. Yeah. Alright.

If you don't wanna move. I wanna move. I wanna shoot a fireball. Okay. And then Clark, I would I just I I applaud I I applaud your, I applaud your caution.

You are also the most heavily armored and and least likely to be hit person in the group. So if anybody's moving up, you're probably the best suited for it. You've been laying the barbarian carrier wait for you. What? Barbarian should not be in well, barbarian should be in the front line, but, barbarian should not be the one being hit.

And I'm gonna whack them. But that but that being said, like, I mean, you're you're perfectly fine to fire, to fireball them too. I just, you know, unless you guys aren't planning on going down this tunnel and the story, but you hit. Yeah. It's not bad.

Image. Boom. And then I'm gonna raise my shield. There. I did it.

I think I did it. Excellent. Mhmm. Alright. Oh.

And you did, in fact, kill said goblin dog. Oh. Oh, got him. Nice. Yay.

We did it. Yay. Alright. Interesting. Alright.

Stash. Oh. Yeah. So the goblin doesn't really have much on it besides just, you know, the regular regular goblin, the regular goblin, armament. So short bow, short bow, dog slicer, leather armor.

Looking where you where you are right now, you see, an alcove. The the tunnel goes to the south. You do see the entrance of a before you get too far down there, Scott, you do see a couple of entrances. There's one to a, what looks to just be like, kind of like a sleeping area. A couple of bed rolls and things rolled up around there.

And then a larger opening. That opening appears to have some lights flickering in inside it. There definitely appears to be something in there. And I would like everybody to roll well, specifically, I would like to hear and Karsten. Karsten, why are you dead?

I'm not I'm standing on someone dead, though. Oh, you're standing on a deck or something. That okay. I was like, I I just I just rolled over your and says and said dead. I'm like, wait a minute.

I I didn't kill you. My guy. You were my guy. Use the arrow use the arrow keys, on the keyboard. I don't get you there.

Easier. Okay. But, I need Cahir and Karsten specifically to roll perception. Samir and Alwar, you guys aren't don't really see much. You see, like, kind of like the opening to, a cave that's that's there, but, nothing more than that.

Yeah. 45 points? Woah. 45. Yeah.

What sorry. What am I looking at? Perception? Yes. Yes.

Perception. Yeah. New perception. Why won't it let me do perception? You are probably clicking on the wrong perception.

There are two of them. Yeah. In attributes, if you go down to the oh. I'm not seeing nothing. Carson.

My gosh. So you walk into that room and, no. He's just whistling a tune and Alright. So DC. Yeah.

So, Kahir, you definitely know that the, that the larger room to the south, there's you you hear voices and scuffling and definitely preparations are are taking place. You're you're pretty certain that they know that you are here and, they are preparing for an onslaught. Uh-oh. So we can't catch up by surprise? We are.

You almost got caught by surprise, but So we don't back down from a fight. Right. Do we move? Do I hang on one second. Mhmm.

Where is I'm I'm right there with you. I'm tracking with you, buddy. China rope. There we go. Okay.

Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.

Nope. None of that. K. So yep. Nope.

I got nothing. Proceed. So craziest antlers and the scaly hide go away. Correct? Right.

So let me go ahead and actually, I will, rest time, rest and time. And so things should just fall off on their own. Okay. Okay. So you're asking, can we move up again?

Well, I want I want to know what you guys are going to do in reaction to that because you can't just stroll up to this thing. Like, this is like, there are people who are preparing for battle. What are you guys going to do in reaction to that? Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Call them Russian before they're ready. Okay. Ready?

So you're running running gun? I think I'm gonna try to flank them. I think that's probably a good idea. Okay. So bum rushing it is.

Bum rushing is dead. My shield's raised. That's that's probably a good idea. There you go. Let's why don't you go first, Carson, then?

I, pick up, the short bow from the dead goblin and some arrows. Might try something different. Oh my gosh. Alright, guys. We're gonna go ahead and pause right now because is a little bit too Am I too far?

Too far down. Alright. Right there. Sorry. Back it up.

Back that thing up. Back it up. Back it up. Right. Let's see if I can add things here.

No. Not dead people. That people do no damage. Right. That people may take no other actions.

That's true. I'm dead people, however. That's true. Very Alright. So everybody go ahead and roll initiative, and then I will reveal the the map, and we will start start the next combat.

Alright. Time stream is stabilized. Yeah. We've been hit this 50% all night, 26. Woah.

Oh. Here. Raging like mad. Roar. Cage blast.

Raging Cajun. Here we go. Oh. Alright. Sick.

Alright. And, so here you should already be raging. Go ahead and drop that in there. Effect rage. There we go.

Okay. So, Alwar, you are up. Alright. Sick. And before Oh, hopefully.

We get too far, I do want to actually reveal the battle map so you seems like a being a good idea. I see a medium humanoid, AKA possible hag. Oh. In the middle of the Uh-oh. That is, not the direction I thought we were going in.

I see, though. I see. Alright. Cool. Cool.

Cool. Excellent. So I will, do the usual things. We will linger in composition. And, this time, since I have my bow in my hand, we're just going to sing a quick jaunty little tune, to try to inspire some confidence.

That is not quite a crit if 16 is the level based DC. So that is, a three round, courageous anthem. Everybody grab a courageous anthem. Yay. Hey.

I've seen you one yourself. What's up? The, the dragon claw thing, I think, I'm supposed to roll a one d four, and that's how many rounds it takes before I can do that again. Okay. Do I need to do that, or did enough time advance that I don't need to worry about it?

Enough time advance that you don't need to worry about it. Although you although it is a focus spell, you haven't had a chance to refocus yet. I didn't think that was a focus spell. Okay. Yeah.

That makes sense then. Yep. So it won't refresh until Yep. Yep. Until I get you focus.

Kahir, you're you are currently not courageous anthem and neither is Sameer. Yep. Grab your anthem. Plus one attack damage. I didn't hit it.

Alright. And I'm gonna try to shoot my short bow at this goblin in there. I think. Because I have 60 foot range now with a short bow. No ammunition is assigned to the bow.

Uno memento. Did not know that was a thing. I I picked it up. Arrows. Do we have to wear the arrows?

No. If you go to the action section under the attacks, you'll see under short bow, there's no ammo. Just grab arrows. There's dropdown if you click on the no ammo. No.

Oh, actions. Yeah. Actions. Short bow. There's a lot of questions down that says no ammo.

I don't even see the short bow on actions. Oh, really? It's there's actions, there's attacks? Yeah. I see strikes and actions.

Oh, I'm looking at your character sheet. I'm sorry. Oh, okay. Oh, perfect. Perfect.

Perfect. No problem. That I can do that. Yes. No ammo, arrows, done.

Alright. Cool. There you go. Okay. Try that again.

Strikes. Shortbow. Oh, I see you. Pew. Oh, it's fine.

Yep. That's about as well as I expected that to go. Although It could have gone better. We do have two hero points. Right?

So my first shot at a bow, we're gonna do a little better than that. Yeah. Where is, hello? It should be here. Right?

Reroll with oh, I have to right click right click. That's how that works. Reroll using your point. I'm sorry. Figure it out.

Nope. No worries. I I don't spend too many of those. Alright. Regular old hit.

That's totally fine. We will do the damage. Oh, wow. That's pretty decent damage. Yeah.

Nice. Yeah. Slowly, man. You killed it. Excellent.

Good. Right in the throat. I've been there for my third and final action. But now you're going to, well, actually, I think that's what we're gonna do. What does this thing do exactly?

Okay. Go on attack roll. Yep. Yep. Yep.

We are going to, cast guidance on Cahir. Alright. So Cahir once and oh, well, here. On your turn, spend that, you get another plus one to attack. Excuse me.

Alright. Bonus. Bonus. Yep. That's me.

Alright. Cool. Kirsten, you're up. Hey. I'll, don't tell me.

I want you to tell me. Oh, I'll tell you. How far can I move? Is it 25, I think? Yep.

25 per action. What's that one? Five? Or 20 for you, apparently. I'm sure we have a heavy armor.

Oh, does it subtract when I move? Only when you're dragging. Oh. Alright. How far do I go?

I can't drag. My mouse is goofy. That's one. Let me see. Your your land speed is 20.

Yeah. So so you can have 20. Fifteen twenty. Okay. Perfect.

Oh, what is the land speed velocity even on the lead in Carson? Oh, crap. I don't I don't wanna go too far because I wanna get nailed. You have armor. They're just little people.

Well, except you can you can you can always fireball. I mean, you can always throw some fire because you have that slowly. The rest of us will rest of us will be up there with you soon. And by the rest of us, I mean, Kihir. I go way I go almost out.

Way back. We go way back. I'm not there we go. There we go. Last.

Oh, looks pretty good. Alright. That's it. Pretty good. Boom.

So you throw Wow. You effectively throw You basically yeah. You basically just cause you you do a re you throw a fireball Oh, I know. Fireball and flame and and kill the, kill the goblin right in front of you. I I raise up my shield and I am done with my three actions.

That was pretty good. These are good actions. Those are good actions. That was good. I was happy.

That's very good. This guy, he's gonna go. It's goblin's turn. He's gonna run up to Karsten. He's gonna try and slice him.

Should have all my success with this. And he does hit. What? Alright. That was 24.

24 hits. You want to hold point of damage. You want to block that one point of damage? Oh, no. Okay.

He stabs you with his dog slicer, causing one point of damage. My eyes get a little bewildered or befuddled as I'm like, what? How the heck? I'm annoyed. My wedding's alright.

The goblins in the back. Oh, my gosh. The goblins in the back takes a, takes a leaf out of your book and decides to throw a fireball at you. Oh. And miss.

I'll take it. And then what's he gonna do? That did not go the way I was planning. He was planning something very different. It was gonna be it was gonna be glorious.

It was like that. Much more epic. Very epic. Do do do do do. You know what?

He's he's just gonna move. He's gonna move up to a place where he's less visible for those long range spellcasters. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Which he knows nothing about.

He there yes. There there's at least one long range person that there are two long range people that, like, killed two of his guys. Yeah. He saw He's not an idiot. He saw a shooter.

He saw a shooter and he saw a guy throw a fireball. Mhmm. I will. The mirror you were. I guess I'm gonna move the screen so I can try that.

I'd like to do this with this far in my on this far enough that I'll need to move. Can I do that? I can move, and then that's a and action. Yep. I can't see anything, but, okay.

I'll try this. And then we'll teleconite the projectile. So, yeah, I'll just, you know, for the use, snag a little something, a nice sharp stone off the ground, I guess. Well, I'm not gonna reach down and pick it up. I'm just gonna flick my finger and, we'll do a little of that and a little bit of this and we'll try for that.

We're good. Yeah. That's nice. That's definitely hit. Hey.

We'll do this. I don't know what that is, but oh. It's pretty good. It's intense. That is a dead goblin is what that is.

Should be dead. Sweet. One last person to pick on my friend. Right. I appreciate that.

Yeah. Anytime. Thank you. I'm trying. Anyway.

So next up, we have a have a goblin that himself, starts bellowing out some starts bellowing bellowing out some random chants that doesn't make any sense and is kind of non sequitur in the most crazy way, but but appears to give, appears to make sense to the rest of the goblins. And, Oh, jerk. He has his own courageous anthem. That's that's no way. I'm assuming their courageous anthem is better than ours.

Not quite the same, but It it is very much I mean, there are more of them, so it is technically better. Mhmm. And then then he's going to cast a cast a spell. Going to cast a spell on himself, giving, him and his allies within a certain aura an additional, he he's he's blessing himself. Oh.

So, you don't know which one because you're not that you can't see around that corner. It's the the one that is the one that is screaming at the top of his lungs is this one right here. Okay. Yeah. One second.

There. Yeah. And then somebody that you guys didn't notice up until this point, most non sequitur or not non sequitur, I already used that word, but the most odd person in this entire group is not a goblin at all. Oh. It appears to be a dark skinned elven woman.

My goodness. That's not cool. And she's ready. Who who has, who who is clothed in priestly armor. Oh, sorry.

She, she casts, she casts a spell as well. And her oh, let's see here. See see if I've got draw a bubble. Apparently, trying to Okay. She casts a spell and a giant bubble of darkness surrounds her and the rest of the goblins.

Uh-oh. Yeah. And that's her turn. Then from the dark bubble, oh, did I just son of a. Garston.

I think that I just removed you from the combat. Oh. That's not cool. I don't know, Phil. Yeah.

You went alright, Garston, didn't you? Or did you not? He went, you went, I think, right after me. Okay. Or k.

So we'll just put him at five. Hold that good. I tried to target and I hit the wrong button. Alright. So the, there's gonna be a few arrows or three to be precise, that are coming your way, Karsten, but only one of them hits dealing five points of damage.

And there's going to be another, another hail of arrows that comes out of the bubble of darkness that is targeting Samir. And first one misses, second one hits dealing three points of damage, And the third one hit critically hits dealing 14 points of damage. Oh. Oh. Oh.

Samir is badly injured. Oh. Alright. Cahir, you're up. So does this light this darkness thing is not affecting them because they have dark vision?

This is not affecting them because this is a part of the let's see here. Well, one, they do have dark vision. Okay. The darkness spell only conceals people that are in it. It doesn't prevent them from being able to see outside of it.

Okay. So I am not concealed to them. Can I I can use the eerie flicker? You can. Yeah.

Uh-huh. Right. Would you like to I would like to try a flicker a little eerie. Yeah. Yeah.

Okay. Yeah. No, absolutely. So Great idea. Yeah.

That's that is an excellent idea. So I will go ahead and roll two flat checks to cover that. And then if that succeeds, then you, if any of them fail, then you'll lose the damage for those. So the first the first attack that hits you, here's the pass. So that's the three damage one.

And this the flat is just always five? Oh, close. First, the sealed. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. And the and the second, is the second does pass as well, but almost failed. K. Now if I were to try and use this again, there are consequences, or other consequences already? Why does this yeah.

So you do need to roll you do need to roll a flat check. So roll d 20 yourself. Right. You passed. No problem.

Alright. I gotta refresh this again. So Alright. For a second. Okay.

Kahir, you're up. I'm in the last time. Hello? Oh, hello. Cut.

We've been trying to contact you about your car insurance. Warranty? Right. Not on. Internet's doing crazy things.

I couldn't I can't see Foundry, and I haven't seen Foundry for a little while. Can you guys hear me? Yep. Yeah. Yeah.

We can hear you fine, Scott. Because I can't hear you. Might have to reload it. No. It's it's I'm on Discord.

I can't see anything. Oh. Try to close. So I was thinking just move me forward and try to hit one of the guys, but I can't see anything to do with that. Alright.

Well, we can move you ahead. I think it was 50 to get to that one on the top right. 45 or something. You can just get in front of him and then try to swack him. Alright.

So you okay. So you can get to yeah. You can get over here. This guy the the guy in the very forefront, you can get into the darkness. Basically, effectively what's happening here is all of the all of them are concealed.

So So they, you know, you can still attack them. You can still, you know, no problem. It's it's just they're they're concealed. You haven't lost complete sight of them. Uh-huh.

So it's a little harder to hit them. Just a little harder to hit them. Just a little harder to hit them. So I'll go ahead and roll your, go ahead and roll your attack. So you run up, it takes you two moves to get to him, and we're gonna do a greataxe attack.

Flat check works, so you succeed and you do, 21 points of damage. Woah. Killing him dead. Splat. In an hour, you are up.

How are you? Excellent. Okay. Well It is it is 10:12, so, I don't know. I don't like any of this.

What is range here? $65.65. I'm hoping we can finish this and be done. Woof. Okay.

Woof. Okay. I will yeah. None of this is good. Be with 30 for that.

That's not gonna happen. Okay. Let's start. Action one. We're just gonna move up, 25 foot.

Let's see where we're at. Yeah. Within alright. That's fine. I am going to I don't have any personal spells.

I guess we're just gonna target this duder, and try to shoot him with a bow. Worked last time. It did. Phew. Okay.

Flat six. Yep. That was a success. But we are going to, we don't roll a lot of d twenties around here, so we're gonna go ahead and do that with the oh, wow. Really?

Oh my gosh. Wait. What? So we rolled a one, but it added 10 to it. Yeah.

So it turned your nine into 19. And that's still best. Okay. Still missed. Alright.

Sick. Well, not much I can do about that. Alright. For final action, we will Here. Hold, please.

Hold, please. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Oh, that's about 30 foot too. No.

It did it did. I think it I think it just automatically failed you because you rolled a one even though it modified two and eleven because you should have Oh, I gotcha. Downgraded the okay. So roll damage? Yeah.

Roll damage. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

Absolutely. Bam. Six damages. Cool. And then for my final action, I move a shot.

Yeah. I think it's the best thing to do. I am going to move again, and I'm not gonna move very far, but we're gonna yeah. Okay. We're gonna scurry up behind this rock here.

Okay. And try to get between Sameer and the bad guys because he got rocked pretty hard. He did. Alright. That's good.

Yeah. I mean, he's a pansy. So Karsten, you're up. Alright. I'm gonna He just needs to toughen up a bit.

Oh, it did work this time. Yeah. Yeah. Get there. Whack them.

Yeah. I don't know if you guys are seeing all these auras on your side, but, like, I have, like, aura upon aura upon aura upon aura. Like, Carson's run around with two auras. There are little blessing auras. There are a couple of other auras.

I just got, like, five circles I'm staring at right now. Voice. Alright. You hit. One, two, three, four.

Okay. Wow. And Nice. Oh, man. We're gonna do it.

Get them. Let me get them. Oh. Oh, my gosh. Oh, it's pretty good.

That's not so good. Wait. Wait. He's already damaged. He was.

This is the one that's this is the one that's belting out a bunch of random weird chants. I am done. Yep. Whack, whack. Alright.

Oh, hello. And no. No. He's he's gonna go here, I think. He's gonna cast a spell.

Oh, Oh. I don't know if you guys can hear me. I still can't get into Foundry. So Really? Yeah.

We can hear you. That's crazy. My Internet seems strong. I can see you guys fine. Oh, that's a pretty good spell.

Voice is a little bit choppy, but That is can't get three of you. Only just. So I guess yeah. Oh, it's cool. Just doesn't go out far enough to it.

It just doesn't go out far enough. Karsten, you're up there right here. I need you guys to make deck saves as the small goblin runs out in front of you, throws both of his hands out, and a huge cone of fire erupts from his hands. So here I will I'm gonna roll that over. Reflex safe.

Yeah. That's a good idea. It's a much better role. Oh my gosh. Seriously?

Oh, much better. Foundry is not playing nice tonight at all. Sorry. Do you have to say? Oh, I'm thinking because here, you currently failed.

Do you want me to use your hero point? I don't know what's going on. I just wanna Yes. Yes. So yeah.

So there's this big cone of fire that's erupting in front of you. You tried to dodge out of the way. You you missed, but we can utilize one of your hero points because you got a few, for you to be able to try and succeed. Cool. Alright.

And that does change to a success. So you both succeeded. Karsten critically succeeded. So Karsten, you completely, you completely avoided the fire the flamethrower that was right in your face. Don't ask me how you did it.

You just did it. It was the it was it was the gods. He spared me. Oh. Oh.

Here, you take two points of fire damage. I thought he rolled so bad. Oh, wow. He must have rolled pretty bad. Terrible.

Yeah. He did. He rolled terrible. That's how I roll. And that is his turn.

So Samir, you're up. Yep. It seems like it would be an appropriate thing to, you know, maybe drink that little healing potion. How doth one do such a thing? You go to your inventory.

Yeah. And where the healing potion is, you click on the healing potion. Click. And then you click on the use button in the chat. And it I figured it would.

Yeah. And you apply your one point of healing. Oh, yeah. Wolf. As soon as I saw it was a dice roll and I can't, this is worthless.

Okay. It was the generic brand. It was the generic brand. Yes. All right.

Goldmeier brand. Those are the flavor eid. I'm assuming that takes an action. I don't see where it states it. It takes an action to ready the potion and an action to drink it.

Alright. So it's two actions. Yeah. K. Yeah.

So the best I've got then is a shield. Alright. Make sure you apply your scaly hide to that as well. Oh, I got the scaly hide. I see that one.

I don't see the actual shield thing. At the bottom of the thing, there's a spell effect shield. Drag and drop that on there. Oh, okay. I did.

I did that. Alright. Yeah. Okay. Excellent.

Perfect. Thank you. It's the, squawking goblin's turn. He's gonna continue to squawk. Yeah.

Yeah. That tracks. And he's going to cast soothe All that jerk. On himself. What a jerk.

He's not dead. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Then the, the elven woman is going to maintain the darkness, and then she's going to cast another spell.

That's bad, guys. Uh-oh. She's going to cast it next to I don't know how to represent it, but Kind of fine, maybe. I will do a I will have the bugbear represent her spiritual weapon. Although it's not a it's not a bugbear.

It's just a spiritual weapon. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

But it is going to appear behind our end attack. Well, yuck. What does this do? Okay. That's fine.

We So we're gonna try to flicker it. Okay. Got it. Yeah. Nice.

Wow. Yeah. And I made my flat track all so good. I just flick her out of existence for a moment because it swings right through where I was. All that saved me a lot of damage.

That that did save your bacon. And that is her. And we're going to have a goblin trying to flank Karsten. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. And attack. He hits, dealing four points of damage to Karsten. No.

No? Are you blocking? No. Yeah. You can shield block if you want.

I know. Not yet. Okay. Thank you for the reminder. Yep.

And he used all of his actions to move, switch out his weapon, and attack. So he only got his one attack. Next up is Cahir. How are things looking for you, Scott? Oh, looks like you're in.

Hello? Question is should I Dealer. The guy with, like, Carson and I or Come on. Dealer. Your call.

Yeah. Oh, who's that? Everybody everybody who's there is a problem. They're white. Right?

Chris, I can tighten swing how often? You can tighten swing as much as you want. You just have a you just have an a escalating amount of chance that something bad will happen if you do. Like, you basically burn yourself out. Seems so fun, though.

Uh-huh. I know. I know. Tighten swing on her. Oh, man.

Alright. So you move up, and you're gonna tighten swing on the lady. Heck, yeah. Smash her in the face. I think I've used the let's try it again.

Let me ask this. If I if I miss, can I use my hero point and still Titan Swing? Yes. You can use your hero point and then Titan Swing, but you can't use your hero point and then try it again. So k.

So you succeeded and you hit. Yes. So you got past the concealment, and you also successfully hit her. So Backside damage? Roll damage.

Yep. We're on a 100,000,000. Well, it's not gonna be a 100,000,000. Because it did correct when you rolled the one. Because it didn't crash.

Can I reroll damage with the hero point? Yeah. No. No. No.

No. No. No. Oh my gosh. Still Alright.

That's my actions. K. You still you you still did 16 points of damage with her. So damage to to the elf. So that's That's the worst possible.

I could not. Alright. Alwar, you're up. There's this big there's this big, Spiritual force. Force mace Yeah.

Right behind you that came and swung at you and had you not flickered out of existence. Oh, what I did. Good. Moment, you would have kittens you would have gotten slammed. Uh-huh.

Uh-huh. Uh-huh. How? Helper the one that goes away. Yes.

But okay. I will as much as I don't want to, I think I ignore it for now. She is injured. Right. But that d bag there asked a healing spell last time.

He did. Yeah. Okay. So, here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna target him and her, and I'm going to cast, electric arc.

Mhmm. Oh, yeah. That's fair. I guess I still have to make that just to target. So yeah.

Cool. I did that. Alright. Let's do for him? Yeah.

He passed for her. She passed. Alright. Fair enough. We will do whoo.

Two whole points of damage to both of them. Sorry. Damage is damage. Injured and still barely injured. Cool.

That we're gonna burst in Europe next. I'm gonna try to eliminate, this guy flanking you. Someone has shoot, at this little goblin right there. Right? Wasting those twenties on your, flat checks.

Yeah. I know. I know. Alright. That's okay.

Roll good. That was not good. Alright. Well, we tried. Yeah.

Alright. Karsten, you're up. Yeah. I guess I'm not moving. You're the guy between us.

Well, you could move. Mhmm. Oh, I'm gonna whack him. I mean, just keep in mind, most, most creatures here don't have reactive strike. They don't have attacks of opportunity.

You're not just because you're flanked doesn't mean that you can't move. If you wanna stay where you are, that's perfectly good too. But just wanted to make sure that you remember. Why do I have two rolls every time? I don't understand.

Because they're concealed. You have to make a flat check every time you try to hit them. Yeah. Why does it keep running a 20 on the flat and not on it? Yeah.

That's the question. I don't know, man. Just the luck of the draw there, I guess. And then it keeps rolling these garbage damage. Yeah.

Yeah. Is he still not dead? No. That's, like, the first time that guy's been hit, I think. Really?

Yeah. It's not the first time. Oh, okay. Miss. What?

That's dumb. Like five. You get to see every time. Oh, it's nice. Now I have I'm gonna I'm gonna reroll that.

That's dumb. I can't reroll those. No. Not the flat checks. I don't think.

Alright. I don't think Just wanna reroll the whole thing. Oh, here it is. There it is. Yeah.

Yeah. No. You can My last go. Here we go. Not in it.

Nope. Alright. That's a hit. Yep. Sick.

Get him. Yeah. Nice. Nice. Alright.

Here. I'm all done. One dead mage. Poor and poor mage. He's doing so good.

Oh, that's what he gets for getting flanked by a champion, a barbarian. Man, that's true. Mages do not belong between champions and barbarian. No. That's not where you all be.

Place for them to be. Yeah. All right. Samir Europe. So what's the story with this nace thing?

It's a spiritual weapon. You can't turn it away from it. Okay. Yeah. It'll probably try to hit me again, but that's okay.

Might try to hit you and that's less. Okay. But Yeah. Whatever. Whatever.

It can't give it to me. I could give you another one point healing potion. Yeah. It's not worth it. I will and there's no sense in this guy persisting to dink around here.

So let's try for this. Uh-huh. Okay. I got to the concealment. Alright.

Yep. Yeah. And I'm gonna run with that. Attack. Attack.

Oh. Oh, it's pretty good. That's a crit. That's real good. That is nice.

We like those. Nice. Alright. Rolling damage. A critical damage?

Bam. Oh, I didn't do that right, did I? No. You you want the critical? I don't know that there's I don't know that there's a critical on the spells.

Okay. So I just replace double damage. Okay. I gotcha. But Gotcha.

Gotcha. I don't know why they don't have the critical. Hold on. Yeah. It's weird.

Yeah. But I just apply double damage, and he's still dead. So Excellent. Yeah. And I gotta do the shield again.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know why I'm rolling something. Okay.

Oh, because it's still targeting that. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Anyway k.

So you can't shield. That that is a thing. If your allies are in concealment and you try to target them, you do have to make the concealed check. So you can fail to heal somebody, and that's a bad day. That is a bad day.

Alright. Got it. My turn is done. Alright. So we have this guy.

Yeah. What's he gonna do? No more flanking options for both of you, anyway. He's going to perform a goblin song. Goblin song.

I have to learn this one. I pay attention. There's a performance check against the will DCs of up to two enemies within 30 feet. So that would be, that would be Cahir and Karsten. So your will DC is seventeen and sixteen.

So he succeeds for both of you. On a success, the target takes a negative one status penalty to perception checks and will saves for a minute, as a critical success, but the target is blah blah blah blah blah. Okay. So you have a negative for will checks. One sass penalty for perception checks and will saves for one minute.

So you guys both have, negatives for will saves for the next round. And he doesn't really have anything they can do with that. Should've should've thought about that before I decided to go go ahead and do that. But he's gonna back on out and he's going to continue his courageous anthem. So Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Then the priestess, she is going to, she's going to maintain the darkness and maintain the spiritual weapon. So the spiritual weapon is going to When she maintains it, it's going to continue its attack on Alwar. Hang on.

Hang on. Hang on. Before she rolls. I am going to oh, no. I can't.

Fuck. Never mind. Continue. I I have acted, against her. Yeah.

Proceed. I cannot give her the the pitiful lies. Alright. Well, she does hit you, but unfortunately, she rolls very badly. Acceptable.

Does four points of damage. I find this is not worthy of a higher DC eerie flicker. Right. And then she's going to cast harm on, So to to maintain the darkness, does that cost an action? It costs one action to, constant any spell that has a duration and has a concentrate trait.

You have to spend one action to maintain it. So she maintains the darkness. She maintains this spiritual weapon. Right. And she casts harm.

Yeah. Yep. Okay. Like if Harvey would cast, as a one, two, or three. Gotcha.

Gotcha. Scott, I need you to make a fortitude safe. Nailed it. Wow. Gosh.

Okay. Okay. And you take two points of damage. This is not going the way that she was hoping. You can always encourage her to hear.

Just just let her know she's doing a good job. Two points at the end. Like, it all adds up. Right? It all adds up.

Got may I suggest something? This is a good opportunity seeing as how it is the three of us right in a row before or the four of us right in a row before they get to do anything else. This would potentially be a good opportunity to take yourself out of the initiative order. Let me and Karsten go first, then Karsten can get around back and be in a flaky position when your turn when you actually swing at her. Yeah.

Mister interesting. Or or you could just wreck her. Yeah. Either one. No.

If I give up my turn, do I go all the way back to the end? You can jump back in at any point. Yeah. So you can remove yourself from initiative and then reinsert yourself anytime later on that you want. Okay.

Sure. Yep. You guys can go. How do you do it? Excellent.

Do I have to do anything? Nope. I just moved you to behind Karsten. Alright. Albert, you're up.

Okay. Sick. What we are going to do is I am going to step number one, I am going to, demoralize her. Yeah. You probably are.

I was just a concealed check. Oh, that was just concealed. But I need to make an intimidation versus her will. I'll say something like, what happened to your buddies? You're next.

Oh, well, the little the little gnome isn't that intimidating, is he? It's too bad I don't have any more hero points left. Oh, wait. I do. Oh, it's still not very good.

Oh, but it's a hero point, so that's good enough. Sick. Alright. So she becomes frightened one. Unfortunately, only frightened one.

That's fine. And then I will, two action. Oh, wait. Hold on. Saying my greatest anthem is expiring.

So we are going to re up greatest anthem. We want maximum buffitude. And then for my third action somebody grab your greatest anthem, I think. And for my third action, I'm going to fire a bow dot at the, singing goblin. Okay.

Pew pew. Get a hit. Excellent. Nice. What's going today?

Sick. Got him. Alright. Cool. He's he's no longer barely injured.

Alright. Karsten, you're up. Alright. Like, I I can't flank if I, like, fifteen, twenty. Right?

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You can get an opportunity.

Because Cahir can shift a little bit, wack her to to get the flank. Yeah. But you could have also oh, no. Because you've got 20. You don't have 25.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But still, that's that's a better position for sure.

Uh-huh. Nice. That's a solid hit. Roll some damage. Oh.

Max damage. Damage damage. Bad. Hit her again. Yep.

I'll say, all that might not have been necessary, actually. Oh. Oh. Nice. Nice.

Any damage. Well, there. Sorry to hear. Yeah. Wasn't trying to hit that, Phil.

That second that second hit was actually was actually only hit because she was frightened. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Nice.

Right. Nice setup, Oliver. Alright. Looks like that's a goblin. He's he still got plenty of hit points to to to knock down there, buddy.

Yeah. Yeah. Well, my thought there is stack all the bonuses we can to, the big raging barbarian that can hit for 60 damage. Right. He's no longer, what just happened?

I missed. You missed. But he can points. You can yeah. There I just awarded more hero points because another hour passed.

Yep. Oh, no. Oh, that was plus seven. That's fine. It's fine.

Everything's fine. Yeah. I know. Right? I just stumbled forward.

I'm like, no. Why again? Oh, my god. Not the greatest damage, but Oh, it's not right. It's enough.

It's enough. Oh, no. Sick. Yay. Alright.

So let's see here. We're gonna drop the loot in there. Some things some things of note in loot. There's a dog slicer. There are dog slicers.

Oh, there's a dog slicers. There's a dog slicers. Yes. And there is right here as well. Among the dog slicers, specifically with that yakking goblin, there was a, a lute.

A lute. A bass rose instrument. Maestro's instruments. Excellent. I don't really like bass rose instruments.

There's also the the priestess had a poison in her, in her stuff. The and then the rest of it's pretty, pretty self explanatory. Also it's award some of that sweet, sweet XP. Oh, excellent. We are so close.

Oh, yeah. 40 XP away. Alright. Well, all right. I assume I wouldn't mind if I take this instrument.

Not bad. I'm pretty sure it'll do better for you than anybody else. Alright. Thanks. Thanks everybody for playing.

Thanks for, thanks for, I guess they were both they were they were gone. Thanks for it's like thanks for staying with us through the whole thing. I know it wasn't necessarily, gone. That's funny.
