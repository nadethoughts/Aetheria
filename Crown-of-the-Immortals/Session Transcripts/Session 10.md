We go. Mhmm. So, yes, we have the, the statue of Vorath the betrayer that popped up. In legend, he was a elven man. So that's upon looking at the statue, you guys were like, well, I good.

If there was if a goblin made a statue about an elf and was trying to make it pretty, this is probably what would happen. Mhmm. So Fair. The note that they found was a blood stained note in a in a, in a curving script. And, it was, blood stained letter.

In it there it seemed to be, a, writing of some, of some scholar or explorer, that was chronicling their investigation, into some dark rumors of ancient evil. Among the writings in the letter, one specific paragraph kind of popped out to you, especially considering, like, you know, the the Vorath connection is the betrayer is diligent in his efforts. From the ruins of Coelthilar, his servants, creatures in the dark, work relentlessly to restore him to power. His desire to change what is good to evil and undermine the light of the blessed realm drives him. May Raythellian's light reach even the these dark places and Jastikar's scales be ever balanced against this evil.

Outside of that, you did there there were some trinkets and things on the on the statue, that were looked like they were offerings from the goblins to, to the altar. The statue itself definitely appeared to be an altar. The area itself appeared to be some sort of chapel. The group then went south, into the part of the caves that they that had not been explored yet, kind of south and then doubling back, to There you go. Towards towards the entrance.

So or so it's kind of like you guys started up here, you went up and around, and you're coming back around making a doughnut. On the bottom half of the doughnut, there was a staircase that's that led, a rough hewn staircase that led up, and the party followed that. And it led to a dead end. However, the party did discover that there was some sort of trap door there, and were able to figure out how to get past it. Once they had gotten past the trap door, they found themselves on a ledge, that was in the same, area as the, as the as the lake, in the in the cave.

You may have remembered that there was a strange blue glow coming from a cliff, as you were walking around the lake. This is the cliff where the strange blue glow was. Discovered, you discovered a troop of goblins that were hanging around a Elven skull, on a pedestal with black candles surrounding it. And the strange blue glow was indeed coming from that specific pedestal. You fought and killed the goblins that were there, and then, were accosted by the school.

Some of you almost lost, some of you almost lost your mind to the to the school's ramblings. It was talking about, it was muttering, it was muttering the hour of the betrayal draws near, the past must be undone. And it was muttering that over and over and over again. Cahir almost came to the, to the compulsion but, was able to wrestle it off, with sheer willpower. It was very clear that something was going on with that skull.

And so there were a number of different things that the party tried in order to be able to deactivate the skull. They eventually, came came in with a, a past, a section from the, the letter that they had before, which caused the skull to crumble. And in its place, at the bottom of the skull, or where the where the skull had basically disintegrated, its place, there was a piece of chronal prism, which is the, the gem that you guys are looking for to be able to repair the time turn. Yep. And that is where we are.

Excellent. And so with that, I will go ahead and pull everybody back in. So Upper Rim Tunnel. So you have found yourself at the top of a ledge. If you look over the ledge, you see that strange green, glow coming from the lake.

The ledge itself is about, you know, about twenty, thirty feet, up from the floor. So you have traveled quite a quite a ways up. I am not there. And also, we go ahead and reveal some more of the map here. You guys also see that there is a exit tunnel to the, oh.

Bob, call them. I mean, the walls. Sorry, Ramsey. Hi, guys. Hey.

Hey. Hey. Hey. There he is. So, yeah, you see you see a, you see a tunnel to the, to the west.

You will also see something that you didn't really have too good of a vantage point or before, but you do now. You see a alcove, not, the the alcove that you were, walking past that's by the, by the lake that, that popped open as well. So you can actually see in there. Doesn't appear to be much in there as far as you can tell, but, there's not the one we broke. Right?

Isn't this the the skull that we broke right where we're at? Mhmm. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

That that that hog there, that that's the, remains of the of the skull. I think somebody picked up a chrome picked up the chrome chrono prism. I think I did. Yeah. And it is noted that the chrono prism itself is not necessarily, it there isn't enough of the chrono prism for you to have the entirety of, to to fix the damage, but it's it's it definitely will help.

So start. And then we we thought that maybe the other, statue had another one of those chromo prisons. So I thought we were going to go break that one too. Oh, the barbarian did say something about pushing over the other statue to see if there were rocks that came out. I'm pretty sure that's that's I wouldn't necessarily call it a plan.

I would It's oh my gosh. I'm as much playing as most barbarians come up with. Wow. Fair enough. Hit it with a hammer.

Yep. You only got a hammer. Right? That's the solution to every tool, every problem. Right?

You gotta admit, hammers make some pretty good solutions. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

Alright. So is this little section here, that little alcove you're talking about, Chris? Or sorry. Yeah. So the alcove is over here.

There. Oh, okay. This section here is just, is just a tunnel. The exit. Okay.

Yeah. The exit. Exactly. Okay. Alright.

Was there anywhere else in here that we didn't really get to yet? No. You guys have pretty much cleared the dungeon up until up to the point that you currently are at. Yeah. Alright.

Cool. You have been thorough. You're the chances of somebody sneaking up on you from behind is pretty minimal at this point. Alright. Sick.

I just wanna make sure, especially having missed last time, there wasn't anything wonky. There is no wonkiness going on here. Just a lot of dead goblins and That's right. I mean, that's what we do best. Yeah.

Yeah. Alright. Cool. So we're gonna time to head out. That's what it looks like.

Yes. Where does the where does the exit go that we're seeing to our left? I wanna know where that comes out. Yeah. Well, that's a really good question.

You're gonna have to go there to find out. I I know where the other exit is, you know, the other way out. So I think that's fantastic. But I I don't wanna just walk away from this without finding out where that other Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Agreed. So when we say, hey. We're ready to go. Like, we're I just wanna make sure we're going Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Indeed. Indeed. Indeed. The only way out is through.

I mean, it's not, but in this case, that's what we're doing. I cannot touch my guy. I use your arrow keys. You should be able to Yeah. Okay.

Arrow keys. Move them around. Squeezy. No mouse. Oh, good to catch you.

Well, let me I I can also delete the, the bad guy that you killed, which was getting in the way. Oh, oh, okay. Well, you know what? I'm not on the dead guy anymore, so that's cool. Alright.

Thanks. He can be dead there still. That's fine. Yep. Alright.

We're not gonna bother with the proper burial for him at the moment. Okay. So let's see here. Reveal, reveal, reveal. What does his work I see?

Alright. So as you guys start moving down the tunnel Mhmm. You see, you see a goblin and a giant rat dog. They spot you and start running the opposite direction. Roll initiative.

Yeah. That's right. You better run. Scouts. More scouts.

How do I roll initiative? Give me one second. Yep. It's it's Okay. Dida the doohickey.

I no longer have a thing. I no longer have the thing. Roll initiative, you said? Mhmm. Yeah.

What is Oh, look at that. Wow. Oh my gosh. Of the top. Be wait.

What? Oh, it is the oh, okay. I've rolled the 20. You rolled the one. Yeah.

Awesome. Favorite. Oh, at least the one wasn't on an attack against the glitch. Not yet. Not yet.

Not yet. We got one out of the system for the rest of the night. That is insane. I see. I see.

I see. Yeah. Crafting check. The heck. Did I already roll Chris or not?

Nope. It doesn't look like it. Doesn't look like Carson has rolled either. I didn't roll. Yep.

Carson. Oh, you just rolled a perception check. You didn't roll initiative on the tracker. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought I rolled the initiative.

Let me roll out of my character sheet. Oh, there it is. Sorry. Well, actually, Clark, I can Oh. Yeah.

If you guys roll perception, I can actually force that to be your, your initiative rule. So even if you mess up on that, I can just make it happen. Oh. So I didn't quite realize until just now. Oh, wow.

Excuse me. I don't see anyone yet. Where is everyone? We're up ahead. Okay.

Yep. Alright. So let's go ahead and get started. Sameer, you are up first. He's 75 feet away.

That puppy's cooking. It doesn't look like my I lost my character sheet. Doesn't look like I have an like, I still have a encumbrance bonus, it looks like. I can only move 20 feet. I don't understand.

Is this, I think it's her armor. No. I because I got rid of that extra stuff to move. That means I would have not got rid of it. Yeah.

Full plate gives you negative 10 speed penalty. Yep. I think you reduce it by five because you meet the strength requirement, but you still have a five foot speed penalty. Oh, because I can only max at 25? Right.

Yeah. Yeah. Your normal is 25. So then I need to take a speed boost. So right?

It would benefit me to have to be a little faster in my armor. I could. I think I'm going through. Let me get there. I'm thinking I would like to do Light that place on fire.

Yeah. Fireballs out your your bum. I I'm, you know, I'm not I'm not thinking. So, it's it's just a goblin and a dog. They're right.

Chris, every time you say that, you they turn in weird witches and they Intimidate. They win you. You you actually had a battle with these things before, and it was very easy. It was you're not wasting resources on these guys. I I think you told us last time that we went in backwards.

Like, we did all the hard stuff first. Right? You you did hit a lot of the like, basically, it it was kind of like I was anticipating you going one direction that was gonna build to harder, harder, harder, harder. And you guys basically just kinda went the other direction, which made it hard, easier, easier, easier, easier. Time out.

What? No. I don't understand what direction we went. What did we where did we mess up on? I don't know.

We didn't mess up. There's zero mess up here. Oh, okay. I'm trying to figure out what I have left in my focus pool. Where do I see that?

You should, if you go over to are you looking at your character sheet? I am. Okay. So if you go down to your focus pool Mhmm. Looks like you are focused with a, with a focus point for your arcane focus.

You can always tell because it's, it's at the dot in it. Oh, the dot tells me that it's there. Yep. Yeah. You always have to refocus your point.

Right. I'm trying to remember. We did that. Yeah. We did that after the statue person.

Okay. So Chris Also point of order, Jason. I would also recommend at some point here that you actually activate your mystic armor because that works for an entire day. It's on for the whole day. And it makes you harder to hit or more importantly, harder to crit.

So That seems like a pretty good idea. Thanks. It's and that's a that's a first rank spell. Okay. It is.

It is. So, like, I mean, at this point, like, don't do it in the middle of this thing, but, like Yeah. I know. At your first opportunity, cast it. Alright.

So can I take a movement, activate the reach, thing for my spell, and then and then yeah? Reach spell and then cast spell. Do I have enough actions to do that for flurry of clause? I do not believe so. I believe that it costs an action to use reach spell.

So it costs an action to move. Mhmm. It costs an action to activate reach spell. And then if you have a one action spell, you can cast it. But most of your most of your spells are two action spells.

So that would be four actions. Okay. Alright. Sorry. How far does this dude run?

What's his I don't see his 30 feet. Well, he's only just turned to run. So he hasn't actually made any movement. But, like, basically, they saw they My guy. You're half I can it took me a minute to 30 feet.

Bottom, and I am 30 feet. That was a little bit fast. So that'd be that. So if I were there, I'm still out of range with the spells. Okay.

I'll go back to where I was. Okay. Yes. I really wanna do that. I'm gonna I'm gonna I okay.

Up to here, I will cast frostbite on the him. Do you have a line of sight on the him? Do I do I need a line of sight for that one? No. Or spells, you I'll need to have line of sight.

Wow. Right. Unless it's a unless unless it's like an area of effect spell, in which case you don't need line of sight. But if you're actually targeting an individual, then you do need line of sight. Alright?

But if you could reposition yourself in one move to be in a place where you're not shooting through a wall. I I don't have I don't have that kind of range. By the time I put myself at 30 feet, I'm in the wall here at 35, in the wall here at 30. I have to be 40 to get there. I don't I don't Well, you know, you can hit the x and it it'll make an anchor point.

So you could go straight and then hit x and kinda see if you can so if you say you take your character forward, just forward. Don't do diagonal. Just go straight, then hit the x button, and then, it doesn't I've been Should be there. There you go. Oh, okay.

I was holding it, and that wasn't what I needed to do. Okay. Okay. Good. I'm glad we got that out of the way.

Okay. Yeah. I I think probably what might be best for me is to just hold an action and see if there's something I can do that's more useful after someone else has a turn. I I'm I'm really kinda dead in the water here. I don't think I've got anything.

Okay. So you are holding your action. K. Right. Yeah.

Here. You're up. Die. You have 30 foot movement? I have 35 foot movement.

Chris, don't you worry about it. Oh, barbarian go brr. It's the Furious footfalls, isn't it? Where do I get that? I see.

That's what I need. Why can't I get that? Those are out of our variant. So should we have a hero point yet? Should start with that, I think.

Yes. You should have a hero point. So Should not have two. Why should I have one? Oh, yeah.

Let's get him, Chris. Right. Scott, you should also be raging right now. I think it says I am. Oh, yeah.

It does say you are. You are raging right now. I'm bidding with 21. Oh my gosh. Reset everybody to one hero point.

Okay. There's that. 21 to hit or 22 hits. You do 21 points of damage, which does A lot of damage. Yeah.

Does indeed splat. Splaaloosh. How do the, how does the rat dog do? Just picture, like, me, like, going, like, super speed with anger. Like, I need out of here.

Die, you dog. Alright, Carson. You are up. You filthy rat. Yeah.

I'm not even gonna I'm not gonna make it. I mean, I might make it there maybe. No. You're not. Well, I mean, got one more.

Right? Got one more. That was only 15 feet. Yeah. There's 20.

A five. I don't know. And mother. Might as well just come up there. And I know about my mouse.

+1, 525101520. There. I think that's my whole turn. It's only two actions? No.

It was No? No. That was, +1, 015, 202530354045. Yeah. Mhmm.

I was right I was right there. Yeah. Yeah. It's two actions. Barely.

Or three actions. Sorry. Because I can only have 20. Yep. It's still five, that would be good.

Okay. Alright. I'm gonna sit there and put on my thumbs. Make some damage. Alright.

Albert, you're Sick. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.

Cool. Cool. Oh, and, Samir, do you have an action that you wanna insert yourself in at this point? Or Uh-huh. If I do anything, I'm I'm just gonna run, as far and fast, I guess, as I can.

So let's come on, dude. Here, that's 30 feet. I would then go it's not your turn. Oh, maybe it is my turn. I switched you back.

30, and then I'll insert myself here. Yeah. Yeah. We'll just yeah. K.

Oh, give me one second here. Mhmm. That'll be three that's all three of my actions, I guess. But maybe I'm in the way now. It's okay.

You can hit me. Have that. He does not have that. Okay. Well, you do what you do.

I do what I do. I'm calculating the, the risks associated with doing it. Alright. Now we're now you're up. Sorry, sir.

I I move. Question by question mark. Oh, I'm on ruler still. I move for one. I move for two.

I'm coming, guys. And we're just gonna use, we're not gonna use our focus point here. We're just gonna use standard old courageous anthem. Everybody take a courageous anthem. That's it.

That's me. Alright. Right. What's he going to do? Did I get it?

No. Do you have this on your screen? There it is. Hey. Chris, real quick.

The, characters, one of them is hidden behind my light effect. How do I how do I move that box? Move them over, like, one spot. Does that make sense? Oh, oh, oh.

Yeah. There you go. You're saying. Nope. Keep going.

What do you mean? I can do it? How do I do it? There's a What light effect? What what are you what are you trying to do?

So right next to the, the chat column there, we've got the two effects. There's a light and then there's the courageous anthem dot, those two circles. The light effect that Clark has is covering one of the characters in the initiative order. Correct. So you can can see that.

Refresh your refresh your screen. I switched it to a center thing. Oh, okay. Perfect. Honestly, it doesn't matter because that character that that portrait isn't going to ever be the next person up.

Right. So I'm pretty sure that I switched it. At least I tried to switch it. Alright. You probably did.

Not a it moved. Nope. I did not. Okay. One second.

Yeah. It's been that way for a while. It's okay. Yeah. Not a critical thing.

Mhmm. That did it. Okay. That works too. I see what's going on.

Clark couldn't see himself in the mirror. That was the name. That's right. No one can see my portrait. Oh, okay.

So we've got goblins. Kind of messed up. Mhmm. For the turn orders. I think I do.

You've blocked both of his exits. Oh. So he is trapped. Oh. Mhmm.

Question is, just does he think he can take you? Mhmm. No. He does not. Mhmm.

He's an idiot. I'm very intimidating. To move into that corner, adopts a defensive stance. I forgot I had all. Yeah.

Doves a defensive stance, and and it yells out, yells out, you go away. I got yeah. No. He says, you go away. Looks over at his dog, sniffs a little bit.

His, his sword is slightly trembling, but he's resolved, and he tells you to leave. That is his that is his turn. Here. You're up. I say don't kill him.

Ask him a question. What? Ask him a question. He's gotta kill him. No.

Why would we ask a question here? Because he's actually talking, and we might be able to get some information. That's why. You gotta think about these things, Cahir. You can't just go clubbing people when it's potentially, we could use them as an asset.

We already discussed this. And now Nailed. Sometimes, you just walk back and shop in here, or we can continue down this path and find out what's really out there. That's what I'm saying. I don't know, man.

I just feel bad for that guy. I mean, he's not gonna win against your giant x. I'm saying this to help them. Should just lie down and die. That's what he should do.

Just lie down and die. Yep. If a lure or a lure tells me not to hit him, then I won't hit him. Okay. Well, this is all taking place in the six second time period.

So your your dis your, your long winded discussions about what about the pros and cons of Oh. Pulling a goblin. I hit with an eight. That's unfortunate for him. And then that's even worse.

I kill him with a one. I hope you don't because they pegs you right in the crotch. You do splat you do splat the goblin. Two terrible rolls. Come on.

Alright. I was hoping more goblins would come. Well, they could. You don't know that. I believe goblins are semi akin to stormtroopers.

That's right. Well, at least the first encounter there were. That's true. That is very true. Alright.

Paul, ten seconds. Everybody. Rolling in it. Cool. Wow.

Alright. So, keep trucking. Getting moving. I'll let you beefcakes go first. Who you calling beefcake?

The guy that can run 35 miles an hour. Yeah. Not Sorry. No worries. I can't see.

Not the elderly know, but that's for sure. The 600. All right. Okay. So you get to the mouth of the tunnel.

Way to be a team tight together. Yeah. Perfect fire formation. Yes. Exactly.

Yes. Mhmm. Petrol column. You see the bale coats of a goblin and a rat dog running out of out into a sunlit area. A sunlit area?

Awesome. You can pursue if you so desire. And if you do, that will be an initiative role, but they are running They're pretty far. Into what appears to be a cave mouth. Yep.

Outside. Well, let's see what else is in here, if anything, before we go outside. Yeah. That's a good idea. I vote.

Mhmm. To the north, you see a, you see two tunnels in this open area. This is definitely more of a please stop moving around. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, you said that you said there were two openings.

I I understand, but you're you're you're pressing on the edge of the press on the edge of the map. So, I mean, you can run up to those areas, but I'm trying to give descriptions, of what's happening here. So you get into this open area. You have two tunnels that lead to a that look like it's look like they're a cave mouth. The open area itself seems to be more of a staging ground for, like, an army sort of for an for an army.

It's very well beaten, has been used, pretty effectively. Obviously not a large army because this isn't a large space, but, it definitely appears to have more of a staging ground atmosphere. There are areas where there are, there there are, weapons racks and different things throughout the entire, throughout the are on the edges of the, on the edges of the, walls. And, there aren't any sconces here. Again, it's kinda one of those things that you've noticed throughout this entire, dungeon.

There aren't a lot of areas that are well lit. The creatures here appear to be just as comfortable in the dark as they are in the light. So there's not really a whole lot of additional lighting in here other than the ambient light that's coming from the entrances. There are two tunnels. One is in the north to the right or towards the east, and that goes back in the direction of the lake.

If you do remember, there was a tunnel that you guys did not explore at the other side of the lake. Probably could be connected here. Awesome. The other tunnel is to be north and the west, and that tunnel appear appears to have the beginnings of, some rough hewn stairs. Similar to the stairs that you climbed to to get to where the, where the goblin skull is.

Sure. Or not the goblin skull, the elven skull. It was not a goblin skull. It's, yeah. Elven Ash Pile.

Yes. The Elven Ash Pile. Indeed. The and that is and that is what you see here. So now feel free to start moving.

Alright. So not much here then. I thought we would check out that area up here. I mean, we kind of know where this goes, I think. Alright.

You wanna move this way? Yeah. Up into the west. Well, I'm thinking. K.

See, it's stairs. Up there. There are some stairs that, again, they're rough hewn, not really, I mean, they've been warped by tools, but they look more like they would start out as natural formations. Mhmm. But as you get closer and closer to the top, you get to a place where there is a, where there is a, metal framed and, ironclad door.

Wait. To the top of the stairs. Oh. The stairs right here? Uh-huh.

Yes. Those ones. More like top though, I think. Yep. Here.

Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Swapped a little further.

Like yonder. Interesting. Door, you say? Yes. This is a legit door in a legit doorway.

This is the first time that you've seen something this, or this natural, or this unnatural in this very natural place. Interesting. Well, it's kinda weird. We, let me have a look see here. I'm gonna see if I can check this thing for traps.

You know? Moved on me. Right in top of you. I think we're looking for perhaps is that just perception, Chris? I honestly don't remember.

A question. Understanding trap. I detect the Trav. Yeah. It looks like it's just a perception.

Alright. So, can do that. Not great at it. That's pretty good. Right.

So you start messing around with the door, start looking for traps, tinkering around. How how how how do you how are you looking how are you looking for traps? So the shot from the side, I guess, be looking at the locking mechanism if there is one. Oh, I'm assuming there is, kind of, you know, whatever opening thing there is, a handle or a knocker or whatever is there. You know, look around the Mhmm.

The seams, the edges of the doors. I guess I can't fully see. I can't see their side of it, obviously, but whatever I can see on this side, just kind of inspecting it. Okay. Are you doing any, are you just, like, feeling the door up?

Are you, tapping on it at all? Are you, just looking at it? Like, you know I'd probably try not to make noise, so I probably would tap on it. But, yeah, largely just looking and feeling. Okay.

As far as you can tell, there are no traps on this door. Oh, sick. Let's, try to open it. He says as he stands back. He opens it?

No. He doesn't open it. He just suggests that somebody open it. That is correct. I'll open it, I guess.

That is entirely what happened. Give you that weird look, like like That's fine. No traps. Alright. So, Karsten, you open the door.

Oh, just opens it. Bam. Open. Just like that. Shift.

Yeah. See, that's what I expected. We found it. The traps on the Goblins Tree, but along the way. Yeah.

Oh, look at that. Nice. Wow. It's a pretty fantastic role for me too. It's a double digits.

Woo. Yeah. I know, man. That's what to be excited about over here. Here I am, wasting twenties on initiative.

I know. Right? Oh, god. But we'll be going first pretty good. Yeah.

It is. Yep. It's not bad. Wow. Ouch.

Alright. I go to the last. So our you open the door. You are encountered with a dark room that is not, that there that there isn't very much light, or there's zero light in the room. But, you have a bad feeling about this.

Okay? There are, Tonight's gonna be a bad night. The yeah. So the only light that the only light that comes in is the light that comes from, comes from you guys. Yep.

You you see movement in the shadows, but are unable to, but they there's nobody standing right in front of the door. So it's just kinda like a little bit unclear about the the bad guy situation. You're certain there are bad guys. You just don't know you just don't know where they are at the moment. Cool.

Cool. At least from your current vantage point. You know? So I will go ahead and just reveal a little bit more. So you open the door, and Oh, thank you.

You got oh, yeah. You can't move. It's not your turn. Elwert's turn. Uh-huh.

And that's basically effectively what you've got from your line of sight currently, Elwers. Just run-in the room. Alright. Light it up. Light it up.

Light it up. You're on fire. Well, actually, you know what? I'm gonna I'm gonna do something different here. I'm going to open up the room entirely, but, you aren't going but I'm hiding the baddies just to kind of symbolize that, you know, they Mhmm.

That you you see the movement in the shadows. There are definitely multiple bad guys in there, but you aren't able to quickly discern in this moment, like, exactly where they are. Sure. Okay. Cool.

Cool. Cool. We will remove ourselves from initiative then. Okay. Where is out of initiative?

Okay. So, the the room itself is again, it's it's a pretty small room. It's it's an atrium. You did see you did see that movement in the shadows, to the, around the corners of of the entrance, step two, dark skinned elves with rapiers out, and they move in to attack. Oh, hi.

But the first one Doesn't matter light blind them? That's not how dark vision works. Okay. Let's see here. K.

So the first one steps forward, pulls out his, pulls out his rapier, and strikes you all with one, all with one fluid motion. What? And missus and missus Karsten. Wait wait a minute. Wait a minute.

Yeah. Yeah. He does. Yes. I did click the right button.

And then he will follow it up with a second rapier attack. Very swash. Very buckle. Woah. Missed very terribly.

Mhmm. Alright. So at that point He's trying to hit us at least. No. He's just trying to hit me.

No. He's attacking Carson. Oh. Not attacking everybody. He can't even attack everyone.

He can. If he's rolling like that, I'm not sure. Alright. That is his turn. Albert, do you want to step in at this point or do you want to wait for the second?

Can I yes? I will step it now. Okay. That is exactly what I wanted. It was just something else to do.

Alright. And, Albert, you are up. Sick. So we're gonna start by doing thing. I can make that performance check, to see how we do, the thing.

That is a 20 versus I always forget to look this up. Level based DCs. We're level three now, so it's a DC 18. Okay. So that is a success.

So three rounds. And then we will create this anthem. Everybody grab a create this anthem, and that will be a three round create this anthem. Alright. So that was one action for two and three.

Let us can I see the other guy here from where I am? He's kind of around that corner. Yeah. He I mean, you you you can you can guess. He's still concealed, but, you you at least kind of have an idea about where he is.

Okay. Cool. Cool. I think what I'm going to do instead, I wanna try to get a little I don't know. It doesn't really matter, does it?

How do I get this effect? Oh, do I have to always drag it? Is there an easier way when I'm accessing the one No. You always have to drag it. Yeah.

We're just gonna do, Oh, I already got it. It's already on. Okay. Do just a full on standard thing then. If I can see and target him, we will pass to, like, for Kark.

If he's concealed, do you want me to make a flat check? No. Or did it do it automatically? It did it automatically. Automatically does it.

Yeah. Cool. Good. Good. Good.

Good. Good. Yep. I electric arc both of them. Oh, it's now three d four.

K. You like dividing by two, apparently. Let's see how their saves go. Probably pretty good, I would imagine. They're elves wielding rapiers.

Chances are they got a pretty good reflex save. You never know. Yeah. Alright. Let's Let's see here.

One crit failed. Oh. Alright. We have one crit success. Yep.

So one takes double one takes damage. Yep. So, evens out. I'll take it. Right?

Let me see which one was which. Okay. Sorry. Wrong button. This one takes level.

Oh. Mhmm. Wow. You're dead. That one takes nothing.

Okay. Wow. You had half a shot of seeing it coming. The other guy, no clue. Right.

Right. Yeah. He was even the concealed one. Right. Okay.

So concealed is no longer concealed. He gonna move in and take his right here and skewer you. No. No. Thanks.

I would like not. Shield of. I can't. I'm just a sitting duck. Oh.

He's a duck. Sitting sitting duck. A cute sitting duck, but a sitting duck. Did he hit me? Sure.

Easy try. Moving up to level three was pretty good. Yeah. Level three is a good level. Right?

Not as good as level five, but pretty good. Mhmm. With that second level cells. Roll. Uh-huh.

Barely. Barely missed by one. Right? Woof. He was Alright.

That's him. I love that. Is it my turn yet? Yep. I doubt they'll have a second turn.

Sameer, you're up. Yeah. That's her. Why you say that? We got four people to act on Yeah.

Yeah. Two and a court or one and a quarter person. So I will depends on the roles, Chris. Depends on the roles. Steps you here.

I will, I'm gonna I'm gonna target this guy. Let's not stop it. I target that guy. I think that's how I do it. And then I go ahead and do that.

Oh. Yeah. So that'd be for I I targeted, Carson, but I don't know that it I still think you have to pull that in on yourself, Carson. Oh, the wrong weapons? I think that's my turn.

Wait. What is this thing? Unlimited duration? No. Okay.

I'm having a problem with my Are you sure you wanna use that in this specific example? I don't know, man. Like Runic weapon gives you a magic weapon for a minute, and that's using a spell slot when you're You could just whack them. When they're when you literally have only two people that you're attacking. Mhmm.

I mean That's not a bad idea. You you can totally do that if you want to. I'm just I'm just questioning questioning the tactically tackle sound. The tactical savviness of it. Yeah.

But you do also have that wild magic thing. Like, did you roll for that? No. I don't I guess, I don't really know how to do that. Well, I don't know what I need to do for that.

So, you know, we said that I'm I should have three ranks second level spell, but you dropped it down to two. That's as far as I Spring. The beginning of every combat, you, gain a temporary spell slot. Okay. It's every combat.

Okay. Yeah. Every single combat, you gain a temporary spell slot that is randomly selected out of your top three. Okay. Well, no.

I think you have to make a roll for that. Don't you have to make a roll? I think it's a flat track. What's the archetype again? Well, spring mage.

That's a feat. Right? Archetype. Yeah. It is It looks like it's it's gotta be a role somewhere.

Yep. PC six flat check. K. So role d 20. Role.

I, I I guess my point on. Okay. Alright. So 13. So that is a success.

You get either a first or second level spell slot because it was random out of your top three and it lasts for three rounds. How do we how do we determine the randomization of that? Maybe I I don't know if you can do this. I don't know if it actually will will do this, but try doing a typing in the chat box forward slash roll one d two and see what happens. I got an error message.

Okay. Yeah. Not that. Might not do that. You can just roll a roll a d four, and then if it's one to two, it's first level, and if it's three to four, it's second level.

Mhmm. Sorry. K. It's like a four. And so you regain a second level spell slot, but you haven't spent any second level spell slots.

So Yeah. Effectively at this point, nothing happens. Yep. Oh, really? That's how that work.

It doesn't just give you you don't just hit the third level spell slot? Correct. They have to respond first? Yep. Mhmm.

I see. So, I mean, that's why Good learning. That that's why for your for you, it's best to be running with one spell slot being spent from every spell that can refresh. Spell. So Yeah.

I gotcha. Yeah. One spell down. Interesting. Okay.

Sounds good. Good time to cast a second level spell. Yep. Alright. Alright.

So okay. I'm just so unskilled at this. Sorry. Alright. We're we're all learning is, on this one here, it's probably, like, the best move that I would make in this situation would be to do one of the one of the second level spells that I've that I've got here.

Right? Right. And if I could make a and if I could make a suggestion out of the two, like, I would try the heat metal? I was actually thinking blazing bolt might actually be good. Bolt.

Okay. A three action blazing bolt. Okay. Basically, you're you're shooting three rays of sun. Like, every action you spend, you you shoot a ray of sun.

So if you do a three action blazing bolt, you shoot three rays of sun that do two d six fire damage. Now it looks like I could if I target one character, I have to like, with any of the other guys that are making multiple attacks with their weapon, I would have to roll for each attack to see if I hit. Is that true or false with this? Let me see here. Each additional Spell it make a spell attack.

It's an array of a different target. Maximum three rays, running three targets for three actions. These attacks each increase multiple tech penalty. They don't increase your multiple tech penalty until after you make all. No.

It means if you cast all three, you're you're sending them all in at the at the maximum attack bonus that you have. But Okay. If you had, say, a fourth action and you wish wish to attack on that action, you would have the multiple attack penalty applied to this applied to that action as if you'd made three attacks already. Okay. Oh, wow.

Okay. So yeah. So a three action blazing bolt, you're making all three at your maximum attack value. That's good. Right?

I yeah. I'd say so. No. It says multiple creatures. One Right.

Targets one or multiple creatures. Could I target both of them independently? Or is this a You could. Line of effect where I would hit one and if there was another guy behind it, it would do damage to them as well? No.

If these are three separate rays, so you could basically say I want one ray to go to that guy, two rays to go to that guy. Okay. And then if I did that, then the attack because I'm splitting the attack, then I would have a penalty for the second one or whatever Right. Or no? No.

No. Oh. You would not have any penalty. Anything that you do with blazing bolt, if you if you spend one action and you do a one action blazing bolt, then you do one attack. And then if you do an attack after that, then the, then the attack penalty applies to it.

But the blazing bolt itself, all it, it doesn't apply the multiple attack penalty to it until after you've completely finished casting the spell. And it applies all of the all that stuff retroactively. There are a bunch of abilities here that are like two action abilities that give you two attacks. They count as multiple attacks, but they only count as multiple attacks after the ability is fired and after the ability is triggered. Same thing happens here.

Okay. Like, Ramsey when he was playing the fighter had twin strike. He did two attacks with their maximum attack value. And then after that, it was like he did two attacks. So his third attack would have had to have been, at the negative 10.

Negative 10 or whatever. Okay. Yeah. Alright. So, this, I think then seems like it might make sense for me to try and attack this unharmed feller.

I just wanna see how much I I don't makes near the dude that's near death. I don't know. Maybe just kill him off. Right? No.

What's the matter? We got Yes. We got two attacks from you guys before they go. So I'm I'm gonna But if you can just take them all out before, like Yeah. Do do it, please.

Right. Okay. I think I've got them both targeted. Yes. You do.

So now I just cast the spell as normal. Right? Yep. K. Cast the spell.

You're casting the no? Oh, yeah. Wrong button. Sorry. I thought it was that one.

How do I get rid of this? I don't. Sorry. This is the one I wanna cast. That's the button.

I had it expanded, so it was my boss. Alright. Blazing bolt, bottom one is the one I wanna hit. Yes? Yeah.

That's the two slash three action one. Yep. Attacking. Oh, that's gonna hurt. K.

So your first Yeah. Your your well, before before we get too far into it, for each for each blazing bolt, you need to identify your target. So the first one is targeting the I who is near death that you were attacking? Or Sure. Let's do it.

Okay. Yeah. Do that guy. Alright. So okay.

And just go ahead and roll your other attacks on that too. So we'll just say the first one was attacking the first guy and then Right. The other two will be the two will go to the other guy. Yep. So attack the other guy.

So I need to roll and attack there, and then I get it that attack one more time. Yep. Attack. Okay. Alright.

Oh, both wells. So, so the first attack, you need to roll roll damage. Alright. Is there anything I need to do special for that one being that it was the critical? No.

I it'll apply on my end, or I'll I'll make sure it applies on my end. So we just roll damage. Oh. Oh, that's gonna be painful. Wow.

You know, it's a blah blah boom. The big roll. Yeah. Okay. And k.

I'll roll damage two more times for the other guy. Yep. That's still a lot of damage. Yeah. It is.

That's a lot of damage. You rolled real well on the damage rolls, but, yeah, it's a lot. I did. I did. Really well.

Yeah. That's fantastic. Sixes and fives and And two dead boat. Crashing them. Woah.

Look at you. Wow. Wow. Our guardian takes a back seat to the sorcerer. No no no problems.

It's Low damage, low better. Wow. Wow. Those are some good damage rolls and good hit rolls. That was double digits all night.

It's awesome on the d 20. Nice job, buddy. Yeah. You crushed that bridge. Yeah.

Nice. Right? Nice. I need to be here. Okay.

Alright. So this room out. Say that again? The whole structure room out. Yeah.

Yeah. K. So you start looking around the room. This is definitely in in a, an atrium. And this structure is definitely man made.

So it's we've transitioned out of or sentient creature made, or what it Yeah. Elf made. I don't know. Some some some creatures been been hanging out here. So That's interesting.

So that's the second set of dark elves that we've seen. Correct. Yep. Yeah. These l these dark elves when you look when you look at their bodies, they have two rapiers, lethargy poison, some leather armor, some hand cross balls, and bolts.

If anybody's interested in those things, if not, then just Some of the party staff? Not really. Yep. Your party stash is getting pretty full. Pretty overloaded.

It's okay. Alright. That brings you poison about real quick. I don't know. I lost that, that's what it is.

Alright. So what do we do? So this is just okay. This is just a tranquilizer, essentially. Yep.

Underhanded poison for underhanded people. Alright. So to the left, there is a or to the right, there's a door, and to the left, there's a door. Your turn, Arwal Arwal, to walk through a door. Oh.

And I know that that's happened really, really well. And I chuckle. Well, I've got a light door. And I start laughing because I think that's funny. Yeah.

Let's go to the door that Carson's in front of. Sure. Or sorry. K here. Okay.

So you got that door. It is closed, but, it is closed but does not appear to be locked. Yeah. See what's in there. You can feel free to check for traps if you so desire.

I can't do that. That's you, big guy. Anybody can do that. I've seen anybody can do that. No.

You just can do that. I can't do that. Why not? You can do that. I mean, I I I can do that, but my trap spying abilities is next to suck.

Perception is fine. Good. Everyone in this game is pretty good at perception. I don't think so. I swear mine's crappy.

Oh. Damn. It's crappy. You have a plus option? Open it.

Let's just open it. Open the door. Okay. Here. Just open it.

We're we're Level 3 now. Door. Come on. We're basically gods. That's right.

Alright. Here. It opens the door. Yep. I'm only a sucker.

Maybe there's nothing, there there's nothing in the room that you go to. Okay. However, there is there are some stairs. Good. Some stairs.

Do you wanna try the other room? Sure. We can peek at the other one real quick before we make a decision. I'll open that one too. Alright.

This way. Right. What the heck is that thing? Or pellum. Uh-oh.

I can't pell because it's behind the door. Oh, the door is open. Uh-oh. And it's not behind the door anymore. I can't see it.

Yay. I'm hungry. So You should be. We haven't eaten in, like, you know, twelve hours. It's been nothing but fighting.

Alright. There's actually only been a couple of hours. No. He means in the game. Oh, I know.

I mean, in the game too. Oh, I see darkness. I mean, I do too, but I don't. I don't see darkness anymore. It just says in our chat, it's darkness.

Are we are we waiting for something? Am I missing it? Yes, Clark. Oh, okay. Just checking.

Things are happening. Things are happening. Why do we open the door? Stairs. Should've went the other way.

When you open the door, you are surrounded by a bubble of darkness Oh. With the exception of Sameer, who happens to be outside of that specific zone. Mhmm. How is that possible with our super light? Oh, super darkness.

Magic. No. But no. It makes sense to me. Cahir, you Are dying.

Receive, like, a, a bit of a a bit of a stab from a short blade. Oh. Short blade. Mhmm. Dealing seven points of damage to you.

And let's roll initiative, shall we? And let's And who wanted to go on this stupid door? Well, if it's any consolation, Clark, had you not gone in the door, the door was coming to you. Yep. Okay.

That's fair. I'm gonna Sooner or later, you're gonna deal with this door. You just happen to face it face face on rather than them coming up on you from behind. That's right. Well, that was some good initiative.

I should probably roll them out. That's second one. Yeah. You would chase them both. Yep.

Well, better than that, I'm like killing rules. Mhmm. Can we see to the other side of the oh, we can't. We're in darkness. You can't see.

When you are in darkness, you cannot see. It lasts for one for one minute. Can someone break the darkness? Mhmm. Negative.

Negative. Sh, Nikes. Oh, that's cool. Initiatives. What is all that?

Holy crap. That lady looks familiar. Second one. Medium humanoid unarmed. How many hit points today, Chris?

You never know. How many hit points do who have? Alright. I'm not telling you how many hit points my monsters have. Wow.

Alright. That that's not how we play this game. Gonna do that. Alright. So, Great.

This is Anthony. Before before you pull things on, I need to I need to progress time a little bit because we've got Oh, yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep.

Stuff still sticking around. Yeah. That's fine. Cool. Yep.

Here we go. Making my check. I think yep. Did succeed, thankfully. So this is a three round.

So, yeah, three round to create a anthem for everybody. We already have that. Yeah. Well, we we need a new one since it's a new new combats. Everybody grab a great anthem.

Old one? Yeah. It'll show expired. Well, then, what do I do with the rest of my actions? So I can't see anyone or anything in here?

Well, you are in magical darkness. So Yeah. Yeah. I can't see, but, like, are they undetected? Are they hidden?

I'm just trying to get a sense of my options here. Yeah. Give me a second here to Yeah. Yeah. Pull up in the guy.

I don't think they're very good no matter what. But darkness, you create a shadow a shroud of darkness that prevents the light from penetrating or emanating within the area. Light does not enter the area, and any non magical light sources, such as torches or lanterns, do not emanate any light while inside this area, even if even if their light radius would extend beyond the darkness. This also suppresses magical light of your darkness spell rank or lower. Light can pass through so creatures in the area can't see from outs can't see outside.

From outside, it appears as a globe of pure darkness. So if you're in it, you can't see at all. You're completely blind. Right. If you're outside of it, you see a wall of darkness.

Yeah. If you cast the light spell that is a higher level light spell than what than the spell that was cast, then you will be able to that that light spell will you have a will will be able to, surpass it. Okay. Cool. Cool.

Cool. That's no. Never mind. That's not how that's not how ranks work. Woof.

Alright. Cool. I guess I'm curious what's gonna happen here. So my the way you can the way targeting and stuff works, I just I don't know. Alright.

Cool. Is this effectively offering concealment, or is this rendering Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Getting ineffective?

Is that essentially But I can't. Yeah. Exactly. I can't see them, but that doesn't always mean I don't know where they are in Pathfinders. Mhmm.

Like, if they're hidden, I know where they are, but they have a mischance. If they're undetected, I don't know where they are at all. Right. But I'm assuming since I could see this guy's thing and could target him that he's hit it. It's that seems like And it should probably just do that.

We're gonna find out. We're gonna do a low stakes find out. I'm gonna shoot at this guy with a short bow. We're gonna try that. See what happens.

It should roll a mischance, assuming there is one. And there definitely should be one, but there wasn't. I am confuzzled now. Maybe I need to apply concealment? Maybe.

Concealed or it should be hidden, I think. Concealment is, like, when you can see them, but they're wittly wobbly. I just straight up can't see this guy. Like, I can theoretically detect him by, you know, listening or whatever to know where he is. And that would be hidden.

Let's just make all of you all hidden. Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool.

Let's try that. Should fix that problem. It should do the thing now. Yep. I'm a little surprised it just didn't do it automatically.

Yep. Alright. He's hidden to me. I missed. Sick.

Alright. And then for third action, I'm, I don't know. Did I see these guys at all before the darkness popped up? No. The darkness was already up by the time when when you opened the door.

So it was, like, the door basically when you open the door, the darkness effect invaded the room. Yep. Cool. Cool. I will cast field.

Oops. I well, I have a little thing there. But I shield myself. Alright. That's my turn.

Alright. Sounds good. Before we get too deep into this combat, it is 10:05. Mhmm. Do we want to I mean, we've literally only had one action in this in this combat.

Do we want to pause it here and then pick up next time? Or do you wanna take a few take a few actions? Well, leave that in the hands of, Clark and Scott. I don't care either way. Yeah.

I guess I would lean it to call it, but, we wanna keep going for a little bit. That's fine. I mean, we're not gonna get through the full combat, I don't think. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. But if we wanna it like, we started around, if we just wanna finish the round and pick it back up, at that point, we can totally do that. Or we can just call it here. So By the way, we call it here.

Yep. I'm I'm trying to call it. Okay. Back up. So, yeah, we'll we'll pick we'll pick this up, when we, we'll pick this up, when we meet next, which is not gonna be two weeks from now because I'm not gonna be around.

Okay. So I think that's going by by by by the schedule. If we just skip the next one, because the next one is New Year's Day. That's the next scheduled one is New Year's Day. So if we just skip it and pick it back up New Year's Eve.

Then we would have we would be or New Year's Eve. Sorry. We could we could pick it back up on the fourteenth. Or if we want to do the seventh, I could do the seventh as well and basically just kind of offset it that direction. Seventh, I'm out of town.

Yeah. Fourteenth, I believe, would work. I am, open on the fourteenth. K. Me too.

Well, why don't we plan on, plan on meeting a month from today, or four four weeks from today on January 14, and we will pick this back up? Putting it on the calendar. Sounds like a plano. Alright. Sounds good.

Sounds good. Alright. See you guys. Have a good night. Alright.

Have a good night. We'll catch you guys later. Yep. Thanks, Chris. Dipping it out as well.

Thanks, Chris. Alright. Good to see you, Jake. Catch you later. See you.

Glad you're doing better. Yeah. Thanks. And I'm gonna turn off the recording here.
