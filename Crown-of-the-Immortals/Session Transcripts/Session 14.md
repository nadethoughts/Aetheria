Would hope that always freaks me out. I would kinda communicate to the group, like, something's off with these particular goblins to the fact that, you know, they they made those comments that we heard. I'm kind of now curious to what they meant, like, in its totality if you kinda if we could figure out how to capture them and not just slaughter them right out the gate. Unless it's a trick, and then I'll be mad. But I'm I'm more leaning toward kind of figuring out what you're talking about, which it could be.

I mean, but Would I would I trick you like that, Clark? Have I ever done anything like that to you? That's okay. You would. But, which would be amazing, and I would hate you all at the same time because it would be it would be pretty funny.

But my my my thing was be kind to investigate before we just jumped in there. And I don't know if anyone speaks. Oh, we did we we can speak whatever they are because we just heard them. Well, to speak to them and say, hey. What's going on?

Or can you tell us more? Something like that. You were all first in wrath and fury. No wrath. No fury.

I mean, that will come. And if they do, they will be splat. So Well, yeah, it's fair. Either way, I think we're, at the element of surprise we had is gone. Yes.

I would agree. Yeah. Sorry about that. We could just go back home and try again tomorrow. Try again tomorrow?

My gosh. We have so far not been very, surprising to anyone. I am nothing, like, surprising. I don't understand why not, but I could be. Just frankly suck at everything.

Nah. Except when you don't. Right? Right? Yeah.

Yeah. There's there's rare moments where I don't suck. I don't know about you guys, but I could use a little bit of a little bit of a a rest. And, all our weirdest will be bloodied. Yeah.

Okay. Sorry. Yeah. It says not feeling good. Yeah.

Before before we do much of anything else, he's down, like, three quarters. Alright. I am going to That that that just feels like you need to, you know, have at least one or two more battles before you need to worry about anything. I know. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. I, Sorry. It's coming in. There.

I did it. I didn't break the old NOMIC's body. Can't take much more. Gonna take a there you go. L r.

And then, I'll do it again. You're gonna do it again. No. Nothing. There we go.

Apply healing. Good. Okay. Here we go. I hope.

Inventory. Nope. I don't have my mouse. Sorry. Oh, so yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. No worries. But take it takes a minute. Yeah.

Okay. Got it. Yeah. I'm doing it in this game. Apply healing.

Alright. I'm 41 out of 47. I'm down six. That's probably okay. That okay?

Alright, Chris. That took me about twenty well, it'll take me thirty minutes because I'll get another one going. Yeah. You also, sir, have seen better days in case you haven't noticed. Yeah.

Mine says perfectly fine. Yeah. That thing almost bit you in half. Yeah. It does.

It messed you up. Oh, it did? Why did oh, that's interesting. Okay. Never mind.

I I was just looking at my thing, and it said, you're perfectly fine. I'm like, good. I'm perfectly fine. But I'm like, I thought I almost died. Well, you didn't almost died.

But Well, I mean, I get that part. But to me, getting scrunched by a freaking giant, scorpion thing, to me, it's almost dying. Why are you healing Samir? Oh. Oh, sorry.

That was, like, not supposed to be that was a mistake. That's why he was confused. He was looking at somebody that was perfectly fine. That is why. Alright.

Great stuff. Right. Right. Never felt better. That's why.

Oh my gosh. Alright. Got it. Oh, wait. I can do this.

No. I have oh, oh, I have a hard time selecting myself. So there we go. Yeah. It's, if you hover over yourself and you type t, that will select you.

Oh, t. Good. Yeah. Here we go. There's that one.

I need one more. Apply healing. So fifty minutes. So probably an hour trying to get ready. Yeah.

One more. Is everyone else good, or do we need more? I think everyone else is fine. Okay. And then I recoup it again.

So it's there we go. I need to get Oh, you said t? Does it just control t or t? Oh, no. That's awesome.

If you if you hover over any of the tokens and you press t, that auto that will target them. So Awesome. Okay. That's gonna help. Just a FYI.

Another way of being able to do that. Yeah. Yeah. I, refocus during that time as well. Okay.

Because I needed a point. I probably should too just for chuckles. Yep. Maybe next time I roll, move silent out, move audibly instead of, you know, move thunderously. Mhmm.

Alright. So you all get yourselves all healed up as the after the goblins ran away. And now you're back to tracking the goblins. Yeah. Can we still track them an hour later?

We can still track them. Yep. Yep. That's that's not a problem. If you wanted to chase them down, you would have need to needed to have done that an hour ago, but you can still track them.

Yeah. That would have been rough. Hey. I'm not the tracker. I think our tracker is the one that messed up and hit the stick, but, you know Yeah.

Yeah. I think I can track. I know I can't. Yeah. I can't.

Was going up. It was not this guy. Yeah. I'm pretty sure that it was Yeah. It was me.

I'm pretty sure it was Sameer. Yeah. You are the expert tracker after all. Thanks. This everything on this is just screwed up.

I don't know what the deal is, but I don't I don't know if it's my Internet or what, but, like, all of the pictures, everything. Oh, are we supposed to be at the map or are we at the to be, like, the intro to the dark woods or whatever? The forbidden forest. You're you're in you're supposed to be where you are. I'm not I'm not dropping you on the map unless you guys are gonna be fighting something, and then and then I can come down now.

So That makes sense. Yep. Anyway, something on on my end, I think, is not loading correctly for all my stuff. So I'm I'm struggling. What's what's happening?

It should be on the, on the loading screen with a picture of the swamp in the background. Yeah. That that part's fine. It's so, like, if there's a an image, like, in my weapons and shields, there's, like, a picture. It's supposed to be a picture of a staff and the dagger and thunder stone.

And, in the character section, everybody's character picture is gone. Like, all that stuff is gone. There's just Did you reload the screen? I have I had to actually switch my Internet connection to a whole bunch of stuff. So it yeah.

I don't know. It was just, yeah, not loading nicely, not playing nice. So not finding things as efficiently as I had previously or at all. Yeah. Jason, you're not even showing up on the screen.

Yeah. I think I'm I heard you. That's nice. Oh, here we are. Weird.

Oh, there you go. I see your outline that says that you are viewing something. So I yes. I am here now, and things are better. Things are looking better.

Okay. That's looking much more what I remember seeing. Okay. Yeah. I don't know.

Something goofy there. Anyhow, I was having struggles with the Internet for a while. So be patient with me as I continue to struggle to the Internets. So did you need me to roll tracking? Yeah.

I need you to, roll a tracking check. So, if you go into your skill section, there's a track option. Right. Yeah. Mister, I can't roll.

Good for it. I can't roll when it's, like, really, life or death. Say it that way. Oh, my gosh. That's awesome.

It's a great role. So you were, in fact, able to very easily, find the tracks of the goblins that ran away. Kinda cover my eyes and spin in a circle and then just start walking. Yeah. But, yeah.

So you're you're able to figure that out pretty quickly, and are able to track them at a pretty, a pretty, quick pace. Like, you're not having to slowly follow. And as they as you follow the tracks, they have it in there, like, kind of northeasterly is the direction that they had. You are you get to about yeah. You go for another, like, hour, and you are able to find the, find what you think will be the outskirts of the of the camp.

But, you're definitely, you know, you you the only reason why you know you're, like, approaching the the camp is because you are picking up a lot of movement and a lot of tracking, or a lot of movement, happening. And then once you get to well, you know, you you go around a bend and you actually are are seeing where there are some some tents and things. You see a, you see a goblin that is flanked by, two hobgoblins. Mhmm. And he What about that?

A sudden stop and motioned everybody, what we're looking at? Okay. He seems to be expecting you. He's standing there with his arms crossed, and he does indeed spot you, and he glares in your general direction. Were you did did that picture get sent?

No. No. Not when it's anything. Oh, pick it here. Oh.

Oh. Yikes. Wow. Is Moan's terrible his own ugly mother. That is the goblin?

That is the goblin. Okay. And he's flanked by two bugbears, which are Yeah. About twice his size. K.

Is he bigger than a normal goblin? He is about the size of a normal goblin. He just it seems to be pretty, well, I'll see. I guess I guess the best way to put it is he's war torn, weathered. He looks he looks like he's seen things.

Mhmm. But, he but he's standing there, and when he sees you, he he's standing there with his arms crossed. When he sees you, he pulls out one hand and says, woah. Does he have that look on his face? Yeah.

From the picture? I mean, the fact that he said, woah, is is better than go kill you. Yeah. I mean, his his his face isn't this this is his this is his battle face. That's a sword face.

Alright. Fair enough. Sword face. So he's probably not as, Yeah. Yeah.

Okay. Ugly looking. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Not not me mugging us like that. Yeah. So he puts a hand out and says, woah? Yep. I mean, I think we have wowed.

Yeah. Yeah. I see. Because I see the them, we just I pull up and do an immediate stop and just go head nod to everybody, but we got in front of us. And assuming at that point in time, you just had enough time to say, woah.

Somebody who's diplomatic wanna proceed from here? They kinda look around. Who is who is this guy looking at? Like, is he kinda eyeball all of us? Or he is giving this he he's looking warily at all of you, but he is paying a little bit more attention to Karsten than he is anybody else.

Yeah. It's kinda what they're doing. Firebrand thing. Yeah. I was hoping that I would just blend in.

Yeah. Yeah. No. I'm not looking for that. Yeah.

I mean, Clark, you are the only one in this group that has actually gone out and fought the goblins for the past six months. Like, you you were part of the raiding parties and fighting. Totally forgot about that. That makes sense. I was like, why do they know me so well?

Yeah. Of course. They know you because you are you are one of the people that was part of the raiding parties. Sameer and Yeah. Kahir were both fortifying the fortifying the town.

And, That's right. And Alwar was, kinda helping out with, like, town council business and that kind of stuff. So Yeah. Okay. Can you real quick remind me?

I don't where I don't even know where we're going. Okay. I'm looking for that one bad guy. You went when when you went through the Goblin Tunnels, you discovered that there were two exits out of the tunnels. Yep.

One was into the Burning Woods, which was a two week was a two week, travel Right. From from where you thought you were. The other entrance was the other exit went into what looked like a steaming bog, from which you'd never seen anything. You like, that didn't you didn't recognize that at all. You guys decided to go into the burning woods because there were a lot more goblins that were attacking the village than were, there were a lot more goblins that were attacking the village than were the ones that you faced inside the tunnels.

So you figured there was probably more goblins in the burning woods, so you went to go and investigate. That's about as far as you that as far as I know, that that's that's the that's the extent of it. Does anybody else remember anything or have any What about the one guy? Thought that he was here. The one bad evil dude.

No. Or or his remnant or something. Maybe I was just smoking crack. No. Well, you were probably not smoking crack.

You you could have sense that when he was here. Right. The only, the only references that you've seen to that guy is the, is the, is Kothilar. Mhmm. Most of the West.

Which was far to the west. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Okay.

Located this way. Right. Alright. Perfect. Follow you.

Yeah. We kinda came here from what I remember to, a, get some more information, but, b, primarily make sure that, you know, more rates weren't gonna come through Gotcha. Okay. Village. Right.

Okay. Perfect. That that helps. I'm still I mean, and my character is still baffled that this guy is talking to us. Yeah.

Yeah. It's a little little odd. I have don't think I'm being used to that one yet. Yeah. I'm trying to stall.

I'm trying to sense motive. Well, sense motive. I know. Why not? Yeah.

Oh, you're I mean, it's gonna be I mean, maybe not. Maybe not. Maybe because clearly he's not wanting to kill us. I got that motive. Yep.

Yep. Right? Okay. Yeah. Sense motive.

That's a, that's a perception based role. You can totally roll that if you want to. I did. Question marks. Mhmm.

You are not sure what he's playing at. Apparently, I I didn't really tell you on that one. So, I think what I will say is I kinda come for I'll come a little bit forward, but I'll I'll kinda push the guys to keep an eye out. Mhmm. Because I don't trust them, and they're a little wily.

So I feel like we're gonna get ambushed. But, I I think I'm just gonna go with the honest answer whether or not he likes it or not or trust me or not. But I'll be like, you came to investigate, the reason for your intrusion on our settlement. As you start creeping towards him or walking towards him, he puts his hand back out again and says, I said, woah. And I stop.

I mean, I respect I mean, I respect I'll respect that. And I I will stop. So just so he knows. I'm trying to Yep. After Yeah.

Yep. After that, like, he gives you a little bit of a stern look, like, what you're trying to pull. And he says, we have no qualms with you or your village. We just wish to be left alone. The rest of the rest of the group, please make perception rules.

Mhmm. As they're talking, I'm gonna start just softly strumming away at the loop. Not like making a big production, just boop boop boop. Perception, you say? Perception perception or Perception perception.

No subcategories of perception. Perception is not scary. Look at that. No. That's really good.

Jason? Is that Jason? Sameer. You are, Jason. Nice job, buddy.

What is the I wanna know what my question mark was. That's fine. I'm I'm making it probably closer than you. You have your super role, Jason, that you might wanna consider. To redo it.

Alright. Our as as he's as he's talking with, with, Karsten, you do notice that, like you you're on the outskirts of the camp. So you you you're definitely seeing, like, hints and things there. Mhmm. But something that you do notice that is pretty odd is there seem to be, like, these appear to be the only goblins here.

Like, you're not you you don't see any other any other goblins, and this camp looks like it is it's it would support more than just two bugbears and a and a really scruffy goblin. Okay. So just additional information. Sure. Yeah.

Yeah. So he responds to Carson with, you know, we don't have any qualm with you or your village. We just wish to be left alone. What is Carson's response? And who are the goblins that came to our settlement and wreaked havoc?

He he kind of he he kind of smiles as if he has like an inside joke, as if there's some sort of inside joke. And he says, that would be me and my compatriots. It's not a sinister smile. It's just a, you know, like I said, just like kind of like a smirk of like, you know, I just just a smirk of like an like he knows something that that you don't quite grasp, that kind of thing. But we will not attack we will not attack unprovoked again.

Then why did you attack unprovoked now? Oh, we were provoked, just not by you. By who? Others of our kind. Vote or the worst?

Chris, as, as as we're talking, I'm gonna play just a little bit louder. And I'm gonna use the, ability by Maestro's instrument to charm this guy. Okay. He needs to make a well saving throw, please. Please hold.

Let me get a charm. Amazing. Do do do. It is not as, mind control y as it is in d and d, but it will certainly help us. D c 17.

Wow. Come on. Miss it. Miss it. No.

No. No. He didn't. He wrote real good. But, thankfully, he did not quit succeed.

And if not, which means what? Because that would have been bad. Success, he's just unaffected, but he doesn't even realize he was trying to be charmed. On a crit success, he's not affected, and he knows someone tried to charm him. So here he is some some idiot playing with an instrument in the background.

So yes. Very good. Yep. Very, very good. I'm sitting here just not appreciating him his talk towards us.

With only three of them, I'm about ready to pull my great x out, wrap it around his neck until he wants to talk. I see. And, normally, I would agree with you. But I just there's something funky going on. Mhmm.

Negotiations are failing. They they are not failing. You're just dealing with That's what Carson's thinking. Well, fair enough. Yeah.

But wait a minute. You you're not just dealing with a, a hostile witness is what's happening. Yeah. He's like, leave us alone. You're asking for more information.

He's like, what part of leave us alone did you not understand? And that's pretty much what's happening. I guess in a roundabout way, I I'd like to get to the pet like, who's behind it and where do we find them? Okay. So why don't we go ahead and like you've you've already done a you you've already, you know, tried to get your point across a few times.

Why don't we go and do a skill role here? What I'm gonna need from you is a diplomacy role. Gosh. Well, I don't even know if I have diplomacy. Deception.

Diplomacy. I do have an okay one. I'm trained. Gather information or make an impression. Just go ahead and yeah.

I I'd say just go ahead and click on just the just diplomacy, like the the header. Do a strength diplomacy. That. Okay. Do I add anything to it?

I mean, I'm Firebrand, so don't I get like a a bonus of some sort? That will affect the, that will affect the the target number. Wow. Freaking. Go ahead.

Oh, yeah. Oh, nice. Okay. I'm taking it. So yeah.

So you go back and forth with him and he kind of like Azure Azure, you know, trying to get get things a little bit, little bit more congenial. You know, you start laying on the charm and and that kind of thing. And given that you are given that you have the reputation that you do with the goblins, you know, you're able to you're able to kinda get him to be a little bit more amenable. The general gist of what you get, and I'm just gonna give you a few things and then we can basically dig in deeper if, you know, if to to whatever what else you wanna know. But the general gist of what you get is that him and the goblins that were attacking you guys were under the control of a different goblin tribe.

And then, and that goblin tribe was named is the Firewalker tribe. Oh. They it's, this is effectively like they were, in in in they they were effectively like war slaves. And they yeah. And they had a and there was some sort of magical control that the Firewalker tribe had on them, and that broke about a day and a half ago.

And since then, him and the rest of the goblins that were under the control of this magical thing, have basically gone back to the base camp in the burning woods because they don't really have anywhere else to go. And they themselves are, actually part of a number of different goblin tribes. So this is kind of like A hodgepodge of goblins? Right. But we still don't know how many.

We just see the three right there, but there the camp looks like there's a little bit more. The the camp looks like it would support a lot more than what you see and what you see. There were a lot more. They're dead now. There's a lot of them dead.

Alright. There's a lot of them left. See, but I I guess for me, and I I would try to convince you know, going out on a limb because they're dead if they do anything stupid Mhmm. Is to let them go if they point us in the direction of the the firebrand goblin tribe. And I would tell them that very nicely.

Or better yet, El Ward speaks up. I can't imagine. You take very kindly to being controlled like that. We seek them. You could seek revenge as well.

I turn around and wink. He responds, responds and says, well, me and my people have seen a little bit too much of war. We just wish we wish for peace. Again, this is strange. Fair enough.

And as he's talking, you do see, like basically there are after after a little bit and kinda as you guys have have been talking, you do notice that the, that the camp starts to populate a little bit more. Oh. The, so like there there were there are a number of different goblins that that, you know, come in from the woods and that kind of thing. He also, he he looks behind him and says this is this is what's left of us minus whatever the, whatever's left of the, of the shock troops that were sent to your village. They have yet two returned.

And you look back in there about forty, fifty goblins. Mhmm. We're technically outnumbered. Yeah. Mhmm.

But, you know, they didn't really press that advantage. They did not? Fair fair enough. We also only wish peace. Unfortunately, I don't think we'll find it with these fire walkers, still out there.

If you could kindly tell us where we could find them, we will be on our way. Yes. And let it be let let it be known, I am no coward. But No one suggested such a thing. These, these have chosen me to be their leader, and it would be a very improper thing for me to disappear on them when they need when they when they need support the most.

And but where the fire walkers are, they can be found, you you know that weird that that weird cave where, where they, had, where where that where that temple is? If you go if you go into that cave, you go out the southern exit, it will take you to a different land. And that is the land where the firewalkers live. Oh my gosh. We gotta go the other way.

Let's see. Do you know the name of their leader or one of their leaders? Well, that's the odd thing about the firewalkers. They do not have a goblin leader. They have a group of ugly long shank women that tell them what to do.

Argsgant? Yes. They Do you happen to know any of their names? Yes. That is I think they called one of them Velcro.

Velcro. Thank you. Velcro? Yeah. I'll throw it up on the, on the chat.

Oh, with a v. Velcro. Yeah. Do I have your do I have your word that we will have peace with your people? We do not wish any we do not wish any trouble.

If anything, I would seek to make an alliance. We can protect the South. You can protect the North. Kinda look over at Karsten, look back, and a shrug. I think for anything formal, we would need to speak with our leader.

But the four of us, wanna find the source of this thing. Diplomatic emissary. Mhmm. So the answer to your question is yes. We can make an alliance.

It would be best if you don't go in those tunnels or to the city because people might not understand. We will talk to our leadership, and then we will head in the other direction. Yes. The that cave you spoke of is being well guarded. Your people would do well to stay away from there for now.

Noted. We need to send word back to him to let him know for sure that an agreement is struck. I thought we had to go back there anyway to go to the other direction unless I was wrong. Right? We do, but Okay.

Once we leave, how's this guy know that there's any assurance of Right. Right. He we need to send somebody back to communicate to him and Oh, I see. So he's going to want to come this way. Formality.

One of your, paladin orders maybe. That would work. Yeah. Yeah. That that makes sense.

Plus, it would probably be a good idea to not to make sure that the paladin order knows that the goblins are nonthreatening at that point. Right? Correct. And I and I would. The only concern I have is the giant horse like freaking, scorpions.

Yeah. Yeah. That would be my only concern. Yeah. That's fair.

Probably let them know about that. Yeah. I'm I'm assuming, Chris, that none of these goblins have those blue markings we saw. Do not. No.

I that's what I thought, but I just wanted to make sure. Yep. And the markings the markings themselves were not blue. They were red. But yes.

That's right. Because they went faster. That's the yes. Yes. Yep.

I remember now. But yes. What I remember it was blue. I don't know. Anyway, you're talking about the The Elven skull had a blue glow to it, but you weren't there for that.

So Oh, wow. Alright. Whatevs. He I think we should, we should go back, talk with, our leader. But some sort of word words just sound good.

You know? We we want some sort of, I would think, documentation. You know? So it's like nothing else but a truce. Also, he's he he at this point, he realizes I haven't I haven't, I don't believe that I've properly introduced myself.

No. I mean, it's We have we have failed the same courtesy. And you recognize one of us clearly and I motion over to Carston. Yes. He is famous amongst our people as a worthy foe.

I am known as Grimfang. And these on either side of me are, are Gromlak and Vrekar. We are the elite of of the of the forces here. Mhmm. And I'm of the, I'm the of the tribe of the Yellow Tooth.

They are not I don't know where they're from. But The bugbears, you're not sure where the bugbears are from? Is that what I'm Never came up. Okay. I'm just making sure that I'm understanding.

I mean Yes. Visual cues would probably be there, but Right. Right. Right. No.

He he basically gestures to the bug to the bugbears, to Gromlock and Vrakar. And he, he says, now now Firebrand we know, but who are the rest of you? Gonna smile a little bit that. I am Alwar. Well met.

Looks at, looks at the other two of you with, inquisitive eyes. I would say I'm Cahir. I don't know if they have seen my brother. That's my thought. Oh, they they have seen your brother.

They don't know him. They don't they don't they probably have some random nickname for him as well, but, but they don't know his name. Probably not appropriate to apologize for killing so many of their foes or their friends. Yeah. Bring it up.

Stop bringing it up. Please don't go there. Not bringing it up. If I would have known, I would have I've been slicing their head. So But we didn't know.

Now we know. Why? I would I would have yeah. I would have beheaded two of you guys had I known it was. It's too and and to be fair, no need to fear feel guilt about this because it was either their head or your their head or your head.

So Very much out of the way. Yes. Yeah. Self defense. Happy to meet a kind goblin.

Well, one who wants to talk before sticking me with their Yeah. I'm still baffled by that. There are many of us there are many of us from all different kinds of tribes. Although, I think that I've seen a fair amount I've seen more, more carnage than most, which makes me more likely to not want to see more if I don't have to. Are all of these in your charge?

And I kinda point towards the village of the Yellowfang tribe. Oh, no. We have those from the Yellowfang tribe. We have those from, from the, the Icewind tribe. We have and he rattles off like two or three other tribes.

He says we were all taken by the, by raids from the fire walkers. They, they seem to have the warring, the the the warring tribes of the goblins is something that just part of who we are. But the Firewalkers decided to take it a step further from warring over territory to taking peoples and subjugating them. That is not the goblin way. So these are But not all your people, and yet you take charge of them, look after protect them.

That is noble. Yes. Well, to be to be honest, we don't really have tribes to go back to. So if we do not band together, then it will be destroyed. But it's out of necessity that we that that we band together.

We kinda look around at the orc and the human and kinda nod. I'd be like, I I think I understand. We're in a similar position. Our lands were destroyed by the fire. Yes.

We are what's left. That is a hard tale. I would like to hear more about that in the future, to see how you survived such a disastrous thing. My friends will tell you, there are a few things I enjoy in life more than telling a good story. I hope I have time and frankly live long enough to tell it.

I will look forward to that. But because yes. If you have time now, I'm I'm all ears. But it seems like you are in a bit of a rush. Indeed.

You can tell your, you can tell your superiors, that we do have skilled labor, or we do have skills and and things that we can offer as part of the alliance. But we do wish to be, we do wish to be separate, as I imagine your people would wish as well given how we were introduced. Same here, smirks. But we are willing to work towards bridging that gap that was created in our introduction. Well, let us speak to our people, and then let's start that repair process, and we'll kinda move forward.

And after we figure out this I mean, I would agree with Elwar. We I would love to come back and have a conversation about all of the other things. We will look forward to your arrival, and, we will, or we will look forward to your return. And if there's anybody else that comes, we will be cautious, but, endeavor to make sure that we're not causing any more rifts between our peoples. If you do have somebody that does come, he basically pulls out like a what looks to be like a tattered, a tattered piece of fabric.

Have them bring this. This will let us know that they are a friend. Yeah. When you look at the, when when you look at the piece of fabric, you see basically it's like a, it's it's basically a regular, a regular piece of, like, off white fabric that has a yellow jagged design on it that looks almost as if it were a mouth. Oh, makes sense.

I'll grab it. Yeah. Very slowly. I already run up and No. I'm not run up.

I'm just walking up slowly. And I'll just grab it from him. Alright. And and he said and he says, he when when you take it, he says, I thank you for not letting prejudice get the best of you, especially considering how there were, how our peoples were, battling each other not more than two days ago. Takes a great person to be able to take those, take those hurts and those those traumatic experiences and choose and choosing to be, gracious, and to speak.

So I thank you for Right. What you've done. I'll bow my head and respect. And then the last thing I would ask him if if there's anyone that's hurt in the village or in his people, if they would. And I would at least try to heal some of them.

Yeah. There are definitely some wounded goblins around. You can take some time to, either lay on hands or use your or or use your medicine skill, and basically, you know, kinda help help out a little bit. They are They would use my medicine skill would probably be faster. Unless it was something real serious, then I would just use my lay on hands for the Okay.

Purpose of So a while back. Yeah. So I said so I'll say, like, you probably have, like, two peep two goblins that are in really rough shape that may that maybe require a leon hands, but outside of that you you know, you're able to take a little bit of time to kinda help bind up wounds and make things a little bit, more comfortable for them. They the goblins themselves, when you first walk up are more are more reactive and scared, because of who you are. Yeah.

But, once you start once you start like you know bandaging them and and healing them and that sort of thing, then more and more goblins kind of flock to you to with their own, with their own with their own, like, wounds and and that sort of stuff to be able to receive some healing as well. Part of me wonders, if depending on the length of time on, like, on scanning, if some of those goblins I mean, I don't know what they eat, so I'm just guessing, and I'm not trying to be a dang. But if, you know, those giant giant scorpions we just killed would be great food for the hurtful people. Oh, they will they will totally eat that. Okay.

You know? Good good source of protein. Yeah. Okay. I didn't know if we were here for a minute if it would be hooved everyone else to help them get that food and bring it back.

Or if that was not that's not good. I don't know. Or to go I or nothing. I don't know. They go get it.

You can totally do that. You can spend you can spend the rare part of, like, an hour or two just kinda helping out inside the village. But more than that, you feel like we'll be like, there's still need, but more than that, you feel like you might be pressing your luck. Yeah. Yeah.

And the and the rest of the group can, like, kinda at least direct them to where the, direct them to where the, where the insects are. Yeah. Okay. And just as Azure yeah. And as you're going through the the village and just chatting with the with the goblins and that kind of stuff, You you discover that, like, basically the scouting group that you that found you basically ran straight back to the village, and they had an emergency evacuation, which is why there was nobody left in in the village.

But, you were yeah. And basically, the the purpose of Grimfang and, Grom, Grolmok and Vrekar, were basically to, delay you, in case you were go in case you were going to destroy you you were going to destroy the goblin camp, to kinda save the save the wounded. So I'm pretty impressed. Like, I'm still baffled, just FYI. Like, I'm trying to figure out how they are the way they are.

So Exhaustion do strange things. I guess so. Or I just praise Wrathilian and go from there. Yep. Yeah.

And I mean, for the most part, like, these these goblins are more I mean, they're not they're not, like, selfless normal normal people. Like, they're they're still definitely goblins. They're still, like Yeah. You know, trying to, you know, they they they have a different they have a different, like, social order in the goblin tribes. It's like whoever is the most powerful is the person that Yep.

Is the person that leads and that kind of thing. So, it's definitely more of like a warrior culture that that you're dealing with here, but, this is also kind of like, troops that have come home from war kind of thing. It's like they've seen a lot. They've lived through a lot, and they and they don't seek blood even though they're still, like, very much warriors and that kind of thing. Right.

Kinda like the, you know, the the the like somebody who joins the army's gun goes like, I'm gonna I'm gonna kill me some terrorists, you know. And gets out there and actually gets into it and then comes back and and it's just like, woah, that was a lot. Maybe maybe maybe that was maybe that was too much and that kind of thing. So it's it's that kind of thing, going on here. I won't go so far to say actual PTSD, but maybe some of them.

It's but it is definitely kind of one of those things where they the the war that they have seen has forced their edges to be softened. It's not that they're actually, like, I don't know if I'm describing it right, but, you know, they're still warriors. They're still tough. They're still, like, you know, that kind of thing, but they also have seen a lot of stuff. And once you once you've been able to help help out with that and and that kind of thing, then they will, you know, they'll give you, they'll send you off, give you instructions on the quickest route to the cave, as you guys were just kinda like zigzagging your way through the forest.

So they'll give you the proper instructions on how to get to the cave quickest and, ask that the just remind you that the emissary should have the, should have that, have that flag to prove that they're that they're a friend. And there you go. You have officially had your first encounter with the goblins of the Burned woods. Excellent. As we are going back, I would still be trying to process that and trying to be, like, externally processing.

Like, that doesn't make any sense. I mean, it makes sense, but it don't make sense. So I don't know if anyone else has any other comments I, I am concerned. I think Grim Fing is basically on the up and up, but for all Mach and Vreker, I can see those two working for a coup d'etat. Yeah.

I totally can agree. I hope not, though. Because I've I've been a fan of that Velcro. And I guess, we we're making our way back to the city council to report probably the right thing to do. Yep.

Yep. I'm sure sure. Subway Jared? Yep. Subway Jared Yep.

Is in jail. Right. Here we go. Alright. Well, if that's if that's what you guys what if if you guys are are good, we can go ahead and move on to you making it back to the town.

So you make it back to the town where the temple is. And, basically, are able to call a, a quick city council meeting. You see, the the the regular people, Jared is there, Angel, Cahir's sister is there, as well as, as well as, Thalar, a elven, an elven ranger, and Thalor who represents the solar sentinels, on the city council. So you pull them together and they say, and Jared speaks and says, what news do you have of the goblin raiders? Alright.

Look at LR. Got it. He wants to talk or if he wants me to talk. This is you, buddy. Well, so how we expected.

Kinda look back in person. And then I would continue and and say, we found the hodgepodge of goblins. They they were not confrontational, but they could have been had we not asked not had we not approached it the situation with caution as we did, to find out that in the oh, shoot. What's the burning what what's the next place we're going? I don't think we have a name for it.

Yeah. It's Maybe other path. The wrong path that is. The the fire walkers. We found out that the fire walkers, a a sect of goblins that are controlled, right, if I get this wrong, just taller, by, some hags have basically been witching other goblins to do their bidding, and these were a hodgepodge of those goblins that have escaped, that truly wish us no harm, have called for an alliance in the South to make sure that things don't come through and would like to have an alliance with us, which we felt was true, and so they will not come this way nor will we go back that way, unless we need to.

And so at that point, Thalor Thalor interrupts and says, so let me get this straight. You found the goblin raiders and you didn't kill them. Oh, we did not. Yes. But I'm not sure, if you heard about all of our discoveries in the cavern down there.

It was clear to us that there was some kind of mind control, magic of some kind at work, before we even actually, we never mentioned that to the goblins. But they had told us that they were controlled by magic and enslaved to fight. So now, given those circumstances, we did not attack them. There were quite quite a few of them. They could have ambushed us had they wanted to.

They chose to talk. Are you sure this isn't some sort of goblin trick? No. Guards should remain at the cavern entrance, and caution should be taken, certainly. But Yes.

But I believe, Grimfang, his name was, was being truthful. A pretty ragtag group of refugees. There's no reason for them to really seek war if they don't have to. They're not gonna survive it. Yep.

And they Thallor Thallor looks to, you know, just kind of he he he looks like he's going to be insubordinate about this whole situation. But as he starts to open his mouth, Angel reaches across the the table, touches his arm, and says, Balor, I believe that what we had hoped and prayed for has actually arrived, although it might not be in the form that you would have liked. We've been looking for allies. We've been looking for survivors for from the flaming retribution. We have them.

If we just choose to put aside our prejudice, we can see, we we can ally with these goblins and maybe learn something that would be useful for our community. And Beller looks at her and kinda, it looks like he still doesn't believe it, but you know, he keeps his mouth shut. And he's like, fine. But if this goes sideways, it's not my fault. The other request that we have had to show is Velcro.

Right? Or is that the weird witch hag? The weird witch hag is Velcro. Oh. The, it's the name of the goblin Yeah.

Right here in that way. Is Grim, Grimfang, and I'll put it in there. Grimfang. To to show the sign of the alliance while we head to look for the fire walkers is this red egg, and I would like three of the order to head to the South to find him to give him our word of peace. Okay.

And as we go, they go. And they are to not attack unless they are attacked. Alright. Jared, looks at, you know, Jared basically kind of looks at the rest of the group. Angel nods, Baelar nods, Balor again looks kinda Tessie, but he also nods.

And Jared says, all right, it's decided. We will have a tentative alliance with these goblins. But we need to make sure that we are not putting ourselves in a compromised position. I would agree. Yep.

Okay. I can hear you, Jason. Alright. I don't know what the deal was, but my flat half hour, I've been able to make audio has not been working or something. I mean, think of it this way, Taylor.

All they're asking from us is to not go through the cave and attack them, which we don't want to do. We don't have the numbers. And to not let the goblins through the other side of the cavern, which we don't want to do because then they'd have access to the town. We don't have to do anything we weren't gonna do anyway. And if they choose to break their word and attack us, well, they were gonna do that anyway.

We lose nothing. True. I can't I cannot go I can't go against that line of reasoning. Although trusting a goblin, I never thought I'd see the day. Would agree with you.

You can join the club. We also thought it was strange as we were having a conversation, but it seems sincere. I've never met such a well spoken goblin. Maybe I would their crime isn't as dumb as we thought. Maybe That is absolutely true.

We're never able to communicate. I mean, all I did was speak in Amish. You guys wouldn't think I was very smart either. Fair enough. Alright.

We have we have a quorum. We have decided that we will ally with the goblins, and we will send an emissary to speak to them. We'd also let them know about the giant scorpion weird thingy. So Oh, yeah. They they are aware of those.

Those are actually those are actually native to the region. So, you've you you yourself and and the and and the villagers have fought these things in the past. So I just want you to know I'm traumatized by them. I mean, Charles They are traumatizing. Have too.

Don't don't tell me that because that's that makes me wanna use them more. I know. They're traumatizing. Jeez. Oh, please.

So there you go. Alright. So, yeah. So Thalor, basically, he will the the solar sentinels will be, taking, will be taking care of the emissary sort of situation. He will choose one of his people to go out and and, handle the, the negotiations, or at least handle the first contact of the negotiations.

As things get a little bit more serious, they might they will probably bring in, they'll probably bring in, like, Jared or the city council and that kind of thing. Retroactively, I do think that there are some things that you might have wanted to ask Grim Fang about. Had you remembered that you had some of these items? Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. We have some stores in Goblin. Yes. You do.

The answer is yes. Yeah. I mean, we have an hour or two there. So yeah. Yeah.

Exactly. And I didn't think to remind you when you were actually there, so we'll just pretend like you were that that you're actually there now and and get those things. So the first the the two items Yep. I'll work just for us to have a flashback. Oh, wait.

Okay. Continue. Thanks. Sorry. So the two items that you that you were, that you were that you were struggling to find a interpretation for, one was some blood stained goblin runes, that were scrolled on the wall.

And Alwar, I believe, basically copied them down. Mhmm. And let's see if this works. Alright. Think Alright.

Are you seeing the prayers. Bloodstained goblin runes? Oh, yes. Mhmm. The Okay.

Maker of ages will return return us to the time before flame it will bring darkness once more and make the wrong things right. Excellent. How is that possible? Creepy at all. Right?

Mhmm. And the and the second thing was a cryptic prayer school. Scroll, not skull. And that, prayer scroll was written in both infernal and goblin. You were able to find a goblin that could read both in there.

And see if this, so, one line in the prayer scroll stands out, that says, at the broken tower of Kofilar, we shall serve him in the shadows beneath. He waits to walk the world again. Yeah. So I'm gonna go ahead and grant Do you guys still hear me? Yes.

Yeah. Wow. Okay. I'm gonna go ahead and grant you access to all of the, journal entries for the clues here. So you've got them.

Alright. So that was something that you did, that was something that you, were able to discover from the goblin camp. And also, as you were leaving, and again, this was something that I was intending on letting you guys know, but I kinda slipped my mind in the midst of everything. But as you were leaving, Grim, Grim Thing, warns you of the dangers of the swamp. He lets you know that there are more than just goblins there.

There are, there are enemies of there are enemies, that are evil frogmen, I think is what he calls them. As well as a number of different magical creatures, monsters, carnivorous plants, and undead roam that region. K. So he he warns you of of all of the dangers of of the swamp. It's not just Yeah.

A walk in the a walk in the park. We're not at a state park here. Right? Let's not simply walk in a mortar. Right.

And it's Alright. So plants, got it, zombies, undead, frogmen, and goblins, and hags. Oh my. And hags. Yep.

All kinds of things. Yeah. Yeah. It's like Australia. Everything wants to kill you.

I like that. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah.

Excellent. Sounds like fun. Alright. Well Alright. So you are yeah.

So you've you have that information. Now you can you can choose to, yeah. You have you have a few different a few different options. You still have the you still have to find more of the chronal prisms. So, there is still kind of that other leg of of of storyline, which is going and finding, finding the chronoprisms either in, in either the, either the Evershift Caverns or the Twilights the Twilight Spire.

And there's also this swamp that has many dangers, with hags and goblins and zombies. Oh, my. So which one do? I really have all preference. As much as I wanna get those chronal prisms to repair the temple, I still like the goblin threat is pretty high.

Mhmm. Yeah. Alright. I think the swamp is the more immediate concern. Okay.

I would agree. So you head into the swamp. Are you going to be leaving right away? You you basically spent a majority of the day in the burned wood at this point. So it's it's approaching it's approaching evening.

So, you could start fresh tomorrow or spend a day gather supplies or I think we should spend a day and gather supplies. Yeah. I think if if it's getting close to evening, we can stay the night and take off in the morning. Yeah. Would agree.

Okay. Sounds good to me. Alright. So you guys go back to your go back to your, your individual bunks, individual beds, and go, go sleepy dine. You wake up the next morning refreshed and ready to go.

So everybody, go ahead and, find your toggle effects, option on your on your hud, which is the person that looks like he's shining. You click on that. Oh, no. Sorry. Wrong thing.

Extras. Click on extras, the the Qbert boxes. And then there's a rest for the night option if you click on it. Yes. Yes.

Yes. Yes. Yes. Right next to the hand on your on your HUD extras. Oh, yeah.

You click on that and then click on rest for the night. It'll make all of the appropriate things happen. So all your spell slots and everything. Oh. We'll get some healing.

All kinds of good stuff. Alright. The next morning, you head down to the temple and through the Goblin Tunnels. You may get to the second exit, the southern exit in the Goblin Tunnels. So we'll just go ahead and get you down to the second exit.

And that we're just gonna touch on on the goblin on the Goblin Tunnel map, but just kinda wanted to let you kinda see where that is, where that blue light is in the South in the South. Oh, yep. Western. That's that's the, yep, That's the section that goes into the swamp. So we'll get back, into it.

So that's that's basically kind of what you see when you when you look out. There's this there's this, boardwalk, this moss covered boardwalk, that is basically sitting above a bog. And you are and you are, basically just kind of walking. You exit the the cave mouth onto that bog. Now there are a few things that you notice almost immediately.

It is hot here. Really hot. Like, we're talking this ain't this ain't Texas hot hot. This is like Louisiana hot. Like, you know, just hot and muggy and just all kinds of nasty.

The, the steam that's coming out coming out from under, coming off of the off of the, water, is, you know, the the heat itself is radiating from the water itself. If you reach down to touch the water, water's boiling hot. So you you know, you take, you know, if you if you actually put your hand in the water, you would be you would be taking, you'd be taking damage. It is that hot. The, the boardwalk itself, appears to be is is man built, but or or sentient creature built, and it looks like it's relatively new, but it's kind of hard to tell, given given kind of how quickly like wood and and that sort of stuff rots when it's under like extreme heat.

So, you know, could have been made very recently, could have been made like five, ten years ago. It's hard to tell, but you suspect, especially those of you who are trained in crafting, you suspect that this that it's more weather, it's more weather worn than and and new. So it's something that's been built very recently, you would think. Are those boats there? Or is that just the picture?

The boats are actually there In in at the entrance. They're not like boats all over the place, but those boats, when you enter into the swamp, those boats are actually present. I gotta go potty, just so you know. Okay. Cool.

Cool. Cool. Well, I, I think it makes sense that wherever they are, it's probably down the river. Gotta point down. Does the water go both ways?

Actually, that's a good question. As we come out of this cave, is it just going one direction? Are we on, like, a lake or a pond? Or Yeah. So this is this is legitimately like a bog or a swamp.

So, like, there's What is the water? Pretty stagnant. Yeah. And there's a lot of it. And just kind of as you're as you're looking out, there are sections of the bog that you're, you know, just where you're initially at.

There's section of the bog that have like these huge, like, craters in them. And then there are other parts of the bog that, are just kind of like, like shin like shin deep kind of thing. So it's like the the surface itself appears to be like pockmarked with craters. Okay. Gotcha.

So does that Oh, and you and, you know, as as you're also as you're looking around, you do see a lot of, like, more, like, more angular shaped, boulders that are just kind of lying about. Okay. So it it it sounds like it it would seem that these boats were just here to get people across this crater. It's not really like it's they're about I don't know. Does that sound like a long distance kind of a thing?

Just gotta get to shore? Okay. Right. Gotcha. The boardwalk actually continues as well.

Like, it's like a it's like a it's like a board like, you know, when you're when you're on a when you're on a board, what are they called? Is it like a boardwalk trail? Like, when you're out when you're out, hiking and they've got these sections where it's just like boards and that kind of stuff. It's it's that kind of thing. So, like, you really kinda have a few different options here.

You've got the boats that you can jump on and and, kinda take off with, but you can also just follow the boardwalk because it it does it does travel as well. Okay. Can we see tracks on the other side of the shoreline or anything? Yeah. Go ahead and roll a roll a perception.

The shoreline isn't like too far away, but it is far enough away that you wanna have a a decent wall for that. It does look like there is a a mooring place on the on the edge of the on the edge of the, on the far edge of the, bank. So, you don't see tracks per se, but you do see, like a flattened out area where it's like, you know, a boat would have been launched into it. Outside of that, the vegetation here is pretty, is pretty robust. I mean it's kind of like more of like a jungle vegetation, the plants are huge, they appear to be thriving here even though, the water itself is scorching hot.

You would think that they would that these plants would just kind of wilter, will wilt, but they appear to be, they appear to be thriving in these conditions, which is kind of interesting. Also looking about, like you do see it's the this forest is also very, or this jungle swamp thing is very much alive. So in the distance, like you see movement, there are animals, you know, about, in the far distance you see, you actually do see, some shuffling, some shuffling humanoid creatures that you would take as like, you know, zombies and that kind of thing. Not anywhere near you or anything, but like basically it's just kind of like just part of the overall atmosphere of the place, you know, you see zombies in the distance, you see giant animals, hanging around, and that kind of a thing. Okay.

Well, sure. Boardwalk, I guess. Like people first? Sure. Yeah.

Sure. I'll follow right after November. Alright. So we're just going on the boardwalk then for now? Yep.

Real slowly. I'm guessing I'm the next latest. I will keep an eye out as we're walking for any, wildlife that is relatively close to us. Frogs, small animals, things like that. Okay.

Right. And I'm going to remember an ability that I forgot about when we were in the woods. That would've maybe come in handy. Oh, you you have I talk to I talk to animals, don't you? Yep.

Just all the time. I just permanently talk to the animals. Well, maybe they can tell us some stuff. Alright. Hopefully.

Alright. What's your what's your marching order here? No. Sounds like me and Samir upfront. Yep.

Sounds good. I will agree with you. Okay. So how were can you give me a perception rule? And Samir, can you give me a perception rule?

Oh, show. Oop. Hot roll. The question mark. Yay.

Oh, so do I. Sorry, guys. Oh, you alright? I had the flu like two weeks ago and I'm still hacking up along. Oh, yeah.

So, alright. So you both, okay. So as you start walking down the boardwalk, we will We will both go blind. You will not go blind, in fact. That is the exact opposite of the thing that you will do.

You both suddenly have a moment of prescience. You both kind of see different things at the same time. Sameer, you see the water starts to the the the water, there's becomes like a square and just in and you step out of the way just in time for a large gelatinous cube Oh, boy. To, pop out of the water and it it and attempt to attack you. But you evade, you evade it at the last moment.

At that same time, Ower, you see two, dragon like creatures Coming at you from the opposite direction, trying to, trying to basically if effectively it looks like these things are are working together. So it's kind of like a pincer move, like these dragons creatures are, swimming up the water and and basically kinda leaping out of the water to attack, about the same time that this cube basically jumps in front of where you guys are going and is starting to and sits on top of the boardwalk, and the boardwalk itself starts to disintegrate under its under its body. With that, all like in Do not want. Do not want. That is where Shamir goes.

Oh, wonderful. Do not want. And this guy's actually over here. That is slightly better. Slightly better, but still.

Still still do not want. Alright. So let's roll some initiative, shall we? Yeah. That cube is giant.

Oh, that's where I got that from. Okay. Sick. Very hot. You're not blast.

Oh, and actually, we both Thankfully, the large ooze is last. Both our and Samir will use your perception rules instead of Sure. What you did rule. It's somewhat reasonable. The only thing I would say to that is I get plus two two initiative that wouldn't be on the perception rule for perception.

You still did better. Okay. Sick. Sick. Sick.

You guys you guys yeah. No. Absolutely. You guys both did, and, like, I can even add that in here. Did it real good.

Yeah. You guys both rolled national twenties on your percentages. So Nice. Hence why you didn't get any sort of surprise round at all Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Or any sort of surprise at all. You guys just solved the things. Yep. Yep.

Yep. Alright. So let's go ahead and begin. Yeah. Alright.

Albert, you are up. Alright. Cool. Cool. Cool.

Cool. And by that, I mean, not at all cool. Oh, wow. Hang on. I got a ton of speech again.

That's way too loud. Yeah. I need to more reasonable. I need to refit reconfigure that so it doesn't come out as loud. It's a very lively tune for the certain situation.

Right? You know what that cube is? Then you should be taking out the cube. I I I have we met? Our doesn't take out much of anything.

Right. Our makes it so that here it can take things out. Can I see oh, hey? I can yeah. Placed on foot first.

I can see what that would look like. Oh, interesting. Alright. What about, what about this? Sorry.

I'm just taking a quick look at my options here. There you go. 15 foot phone. Underway. There we go.

There we go. Oh, that's also pretty good. Alright. We're gonna try that because, code. And we're in a good position, and that's not gonna come up for you much.

So step one, we say the words warlock, and we are gonna go ahead and, do the courageous anthem, except it should be oh, higher. There we go. Add. There we go. Alright.

Bam. Oh, not a great oh, that's a failure. That's alright. Well, it's gonna be a a normal oh, yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. I will actually because I don't roll a lot of d 20, so I may as well. That is a good call. That's a weird thing to hero point. But Oh, there you go.

Oh. But, you know. Alright. Cool. So that is going to be a long lasting one except, that's not reflecting in the thing.

The actually, kept just the original roll for the duration on those. I'll just change it. It's four rounds. Right? Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then I'm going to cast dizzying colors, and I can place this 15 foot cone like so, and it will hit both of the darnacle beds. So, like, whereas this is all where, you know, kinda sees the the dragon swimming up the the thing, and he's like, now he's there, so he turns around to tell everybody that he sees the cube.

And he's like, oh, and he just instinctively just, you know, does some magic on his loot, blast the colors out, and as he does so, just just just that, just rainbow magic comes out from the center of him and hits the two dragons, as well as the the standard, courageous anthem. K. And we'll I have to use on the will save automatically do it. Did it automatically think oh. What?

Wait. What? Both critically succeeded. With a What? Woah.

They say that? Math. But will it's a yeah. So will save d c nineteen and twenty does not get you a critical success. So Yeah.

That's that's correct. They just succeeded. They did not critically succeed. Okay. Yeah.

I'm like, that math does the math. Yeah. They are both dazzled for one round then. Oh, success. Oh.

Better than nothing. Yes. Not sure how to get rid of that cone I placed on the battlefield, Chris. That's easy enough. Okay.

If you, if you do the measuring measurement tools, if you just click on that, you can, just Oh, okay. Click on it and delete it. But I got it. No worries. So we have two dazzle dragons.

A duo of dazzle dragons. Alright. So this one It almost appears like they have bright glowing lights at the end of their neck instead of heads. Right. I'm just glad that I blow my second level spell on these guys if they both succeeded.

Right. It's tough. K. So this dragon is going to lob a, he's going to, basically hawk a giant loogie. There there's some caustic mucus that erupts out of its throat and hits, and hits on the far end of the boardwalk, hitting our Karsten and Cahir.

I'm going to need reflex saves from all of you. Nice. Nice. That's that's pretty good. Yeah.

Oh, now you're rolling. I'm gonna reroll mine so you Okay. You don't even know how hard it's gonna hit. Let it hit. No.

I got a I got a nine, buddy. I see that. So let's just redo that. Oh. That c much better.

Much better. Much better. That moved it from a critical failure to a, to an actual success. So we'll take it. Yeah.

So Still take 40 points of damage. Lord. Everybody still everybody takes half 12 damage. So six damage. Got it.

It does it for us. Right? Nothing else happens because you guys all succeeded, which is very sad. Oh, holy problem. Oh, Clark, I think you have to click that half.

Yeah. Oh, after all. Okay. Thank you. Wasn't quite sure.

And then, and then and then the, the river drake, whips its tail at Cahir. So whips it from that far? Yeah. Yep. Got that reach.

Reaching. Successed, Did success. Deals 12 points of damage to Kihir. Karsten, you do, you can choose to use your retributive strike as you as your reaction. You can use your champions reaction at this point.

What this does for what this does for kit here specifically is obviously you're not within striking range, so you can't attack it, but, it's got a second half. Let's do the AC, right? No. The plus two to the AC is lay on hands. The rest of you have strike is I believe it's a, damage reduction.

That's The enemy damage to your ally both both are in your champions aura. You protect your ally and strike your enemy. Ally gains resistance to all damage against triggering damage triggering damage equal to two plus your level if the enemy is within reach like a melee strike against it. Right. So basically, if you use your retributive strike here, you're not gonna be able to attack it, but you're gonna be giving Tahir damage reduction five, for the for the rest of the round.

Yeah. That's really good. Yeah. K. I just did that.

I like that. Alright. Bye bye. So we'll go ahead and drop the champions resistance on Cahir, then do the damage and let's you should only be taking seven damage to here when I do this. Yep.

Yep. Nice job. Nice work. We're going to work together. Yep.

So, yeah, that like, this sort of stuff, Clark, this is like the champion's, like, bread and butter, like, super awesome stuff that he does. Like, the barbarian smashes things in the face really, really hard. The champion just makes it really really hard for anybody to take damage, you know. That's where that's why I like lay on hands in combat gives plus two to AC and then the retro view of strike gives damage resistance. That's that's kinda like that's the stuff to keep your eye out for.

Okay. Just side note. Trying to tell you how awesome your character is. That's pretty good. Alright.

Tamir, you're up. Alright. I don't know what that jelly thing is. That's weird. I've never seen one.

No. The gelatinous, Whatever it is. Gas is kinda The gelatinous cube is in fact another one of those D and D monsters that I've never actually seen in real life. Yeah. I've I've I've been over a couple.

Well, I mean, he was the one that But yeah. But but it is a classic D and D monster. It's one of those things that, like, everybody's first in gelatinous cube, not this guy. So So I don't I'm not I'm not activating the reach on this, so I don't Okay. Think I need to take the extra action.

There's two actions to do the spell anyway. Right? Right. So Right. It needs a fortitude save, I guess.

The gelateness cube? Yes. I think I've got it targeted correctly. Oh, you got the frostbite? Mhmm.

It seems a logical thing to do. What the? Yeah. It correctly succeeded. Woah.

Yeah. June. So it's not gonna take any damage then, I'm assuming. Right? Right.

Yeah. Alright. Like a critical success is literally the only way that it's, that it's not gonna take damage. Although, you may feel like your turn has been wasted. However, this does tell you guys all something about the gelatinous cube.

I I don't know if you guys can see the actual role itself, but Nope. Okay. But to give a 31, the older big numbers. Yeah. Right.

Yeah. It says yeah. Right. Five plus 12, so that means 19. Right?

Uh-huh. Yeah. So that's yeah. So that's that's the thing that's the thing that you learn is this thing has a really good fort safe. So Oh.

It's just not a wasted turn. I should have I can do the shield. Right? It's just one action. I will do the shield.

Yep. I would also I would also like to remind you, just in case, that, most monsters and creatures in pathfinder do not have attacks of opportunity. Mhmm. So if you wanted to not be right next to the gelatinous cube, that is something that you could do and not, and and not be in in a and not have a chance of it attacking you. So, that is also something.

They're saying run past the cube potentially. Well, you could, but you'd be hopping off of the boardwalk and into the salting water. That's kinda what I'm looking at. So I'm But where you are but where you are right now, if you do if you do not move, the only person that will be able to get to it without jumping to the scalding water is you. So Mhmm.

Mhmm. We can't walk past each other? You can walk through each other, but if you are, like, right in if you are, like, right in front of the cube and you're on the boardwalk, like, I mean, here, you could jump into the water and get around it. But that is involving hot water. Yeah.

That's not what I said. I'm on this little twig here on this one little twig piece, balancing with a great x. Doing great. You do great. But know that so I mean that just from a tactical perspective, like you being a not not a melee combatant ending right in front of the thing, maybe not the best idea in the world.

Or maybe it's the greatest idea in the world. Maybe maybe you've got something worked out. I don't know. No. I don't have crap worked out.

Anyway, is the shield up by the The shield is currently up. Yeah. Okay. Alright. If you wanna stand by it, you're you're good.

No problem. There are plenty of other bad guys to to hit. So it's not like you're it's not like you're staying in the way of the only bad guy. So No. Yeah.

At this point, we have no idea what the generalist cube does besides dissolve people. Right. Which We would need to find out. Right? Right.

Somebody needs to die. So why not me? Alright. Yeah. I think I'm good.

Okay. Okay. Here. You were up. Alrighty.

Go here. Bang. Boom. I ring. Oh, nice.

Oh my god. On my end. Yes. Okay. It sounds so disappointed.

Where's this at now? That is amazing. Smashed. Oh my god. Oh, wow.

That is amazing. It's a dragon. So, I mean, it's got, like, a few hit points, but that's fantastic. But that's It is still a lot. 40 hit points.

Barely. Try again. Wow. Oh my god. Oh my gosh.

All my damage. Yeah. That is awesome. Great. Another another hit, I do not understand how you can hit as often as you do, man.

That's just Yes. Nobody quits to all the time. All the frames are right. Yeah. Yeah.

Accident. Accident. Wow. It's what we call pure talent. Yeah.

And he only crits these things on a 20. So yeah. Oh my gosh. Alright. The the the River Drake that was that was creeping up on on our, just got completely decimated.

Oh, I have to take the little guys. Jeez. Carson, you're up. I am. I don't really know where you want me to go, I guess.

Where do you want to go? I don't really know. Like, what's his face is? He's good over there. Guess I'm gonna go there.

Water? Jump into the scalding water? I don't wanna go in the scalding water. Oh, can I is there a little edge right there? No.

Stand on my shoulders. Yeah. You there's no way to get vigilant in this cube, right now. Unfortunately, I guess I'll go I guess I'm gonna go right movement. Right?

Yeah. I gotta do I gotta move him back. Yeah. Yeah. He was back there.

Yeah. He was right there. Yep. Yep. That should get you.

Yeah. 25, you could have attempted to tumble through. But Oh, that's true. Here we go. You with 20, you don't even have a chance.

Yeah. Yeah. Alright. I will whack him Alright. With my, my super hit.

Your Titan swing? Yeah. My Titan swing will be the last of my, unarmed nope. Field elemental blast. I guess that's it.

That sucks. Oh, wait. Time out. Here we go. I am there we go.

And there we go. Oh. I'm gonna use my thingy. Last one. Point?

Yeah. I'm gonna use my thingy. There. Oh. Yep.

I don't see all that. Alright. Bam. You run up to it and and have a, have a corona light empowered swing. Please roll a, please roll a backlash.

So roll a d 20. You're looking for above a five. Oh my gosh. Okay. So the backlash, it's it's not terrible for for this for this backlash for the first it gets worse as time goes on.

But, you have a strained metabolism, which makes you in feebled one and clumsy one until you take a bite of food, which requires two interact actions in order to do that. K. Did he kick back five feet? We're always forgetting to do that. Oh, yeah.

And he gets pushed back five feet. Are you moving me five feet? Not you. The the monster. You you hit it so Oh, yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Heavily that it pushes it back.

That's right. Alright. Now it's the user's turn. That's so cute. Sameer, I need you to make your reflex save.

Uh-huh. You should be able to. Right? No. I shouldn't be able to do that.

Why? Does that. Oh, wow. Do you have another hero point? Oh, I've got lots of hero points.

I would use one. Yeah. That's that's what I want. Use. Does it?

Yeah. Is that a critical fail? Most likely. Yes. Yes.

There's no way that that isn't a critical fail. 25. Okay. Alright. So you do succeed.

Let's see here. That fails to save is pulled into the monster's body. You did not fail your save. So you did not get pulled into the monster's body. It's probably for the best.

Yeah. Kinda sad but, I mean, I did fail. Pretty hardcore. Okay. So you do take you do you do take two points of acid damage.

Do I need to And the ooze basically the ooze basically just moves forward and tries to tries to like pull you into its body, but you're able to evade it, enough so it can't so it can't actually do that. It just touches me, it doesn't pull me in. Right. But it is going to strike you with a cube face though. With cube face?

Mhmm. Cube face. I'm gonna I'm gonna look like a cube? No. So Mhmm.

Oh, it hits me at twenty four. Yeah. You do have the opportunity to use your, use your, special ability, the eerie flicker at this point. It is going to hit you unless you do that. Okay.

I will do it. It'll be fun. Let's do it. How do what happened? I hit the button.

Okay. Yeah. It it doesn't automatically grant it, but basically what eerie flicker does is give you concealed, it makes you concealed for around. Oh, I have to only have to roll to see if it happens even? No.

You just do it. I have to roll to see if, you you overpass. I have to roll to see if I am able to actually hit you from which I don't. Oh, nice. So, very nice.

Yeah. So the pseudopod basically, comes out and it attacks you and then it just passes through your body as you phase shift and then it pulls its, pulls its arm back out. Completely misses you. Sorcerer tank for the win. Oh, hey.

I gotta do my thing, right? Backlash. Yep. Oh, yep. Yeah.

Roll a d 20. A d 20? Yep. Yeah. Okay.

D 20. Looking for a five or higher. I think with the very flicker, it's high. It's a bigger one, isn't it? Oh, is it?

No. Backlash is bad if you fail it, but I can get that way. It seems The flat check is is five. So for your first one, it's 5. Yay.

And you Oh, that's right. Don't don't get it. Success slash for you. Alright. Outward, you're up.

Alright. Oh, well. Okay. That's good to know. I think that's the plan.

I don't wanna use another leveled spell, I think. I don't have a ton of those, and this we're just getting started. So let's do a couple things. I'm not entirely in the way. Someone can be next to me and they can move past me.

Is this square right to my south, is that a standable square? That is a standable square. Okay. Alright. Alright.

Then I'm not feeling like I need to move. So what I'm a do is I'm going to recall knowledge on this queue because I don't know what the shit, that thing's all about. Okay. So far, it moves. Yeah.

Yeah. It It acidifies you. It tries to eat people. Yeah. So I'm gonna That's all I got so far.

War this thing for knowledge. So versus its specific lore or whatever. Set this to, flying to g m roll. Bam. I tried to recall some knowledge.

And I want to know, I don't know. I guess any resistances or immunities. Okay. You are able to recall that these sorts of the these sorts of creatures are resistant to electricity damage. Oh, excellent.

The very thing I was just about to would probably still am going to do. Right. Because I don't have a whole lot of everything better to do. Well, yeah. I think we're just gonna do it.

We will electric arc both of these guys. Alright. Wow. Mhmm. Terrible.

He doesn't need resistance. I, like, scooted my feet across the carpet and, like, static shocked him. Alright. Four damage. He critically failed.

Well, that's something. The only took the damage. Nice. Alright. Cool.

Good good turd. Yeah. That's me. Alright. We got a for Drake.

That would be nice to remember. Okay. This River Drake is going to move up to Carson. Pardon? No.

I'm not here anymore. And he's going to draconic frenzy. Oh. Which means, He's a barbarian. Kind of.

I mean, it's it's pretty it's it's he's going to bite you, and then he's going to hit you with his tail twice, at least attempt to. We he's trying. Mhmm. We'll do one of those things. It I mean, how much is that?

That's two actions. Yeah. Yeah. But he does he does he does in fact bite you. So deals 18 points of damage as he takes a chunk out of your armor.

Ouch. And no secondary effects. Phew. It's good. Samir, you're up.

Look at that. I don't know. The ice Samir, you could choose to try and tumble through if you wanted. Through what? Yeah.

Get onto the other side? I don't know what that laugh was all about, though. Didn't sound like a great idea. Yeah. Just rolling through the city You know, I don't know what his acrobatics is.

If he's a good acrobatics if if he's good at acrobatics, it's a great idea. Let's see. Pretty good. Interesting. Okay.

Yeah. Why not? Let's let's do that. That'll be fun. Skills.

Acrobats. Tumble through. Oh. Oh. We'll tumble through.

Our fun fellow. Alright. Tumble. Oh, man. I thought that was gonna be a two.

Mhmm. It's the enemy's reflex, do you see? Oh, yeah. No problem. Let's go.

On the other side. That'll confuse it. Yeah. You, some somehow you leap over the giant over the giant, square of acidic mucus and land on the other side. Splendid.

Now you have two actions to spend. I've got I've got two actions left. Uh-huh. Oh, okay. I was just hoping to pull up something to read, but, I guess I'm not reading.

You can read that. I think, and then it allows me to close to okay. I don't think I like either of those. Okay. Sorry.

Just trying to get things right here. I'll go ahead and do the blazing bolt. Two things right to the computer. Okay. This is a little bit different, I guess.

So we'll do that. And we are attacking. So we're attacking. I attack at a 10. You hit.

Eight plus 10. Wow. I hit. Yep. Oh, look at that.

Roll that damage. Roll damage. There's some decent rolls in that. Nice. It's sizzling.

Mhmm. Mhmm. Was it just the use that you were attacking? I did target both of them. I used the spells if I were going to attack both.

K. So I don't know how to do this. Two action blazing bolt does? Yeah. Yep.

Yeah. Each action for the bolt targets a different character. Yep. Okay. Well, it looks like from 18 Excellent.

Three. Yeah. They'll hit both. Yep. Okay.

So damage damage. Excellent. 16 plus three. He's barely hurt. Hurt?

Good. Yes. The, the the the large ooze is is is a pretty tough cookie. Darniggle bad. See better days though.

He ain't feeling good. Yes. That's true. Alright. And, Kahir, you're up.

Now you have your choice. Right. Okay. First thing's gonna go. Oh, go ahead, Jason.

Chris, I was supposed to do my wild magic stuff, whatever that is. Oh, yeah. So at least since this is the first combat of the of the game, of the day, your wild magic stuff doesn't really apply because you remember you got to have any spell slots used. Yep. Yeah.

You didn't have any empty spell slot effect. So Is that gonna take effect, like, next round or not this encounter at all? Not this encounter. Yeah. It'll be the next encounter.

Okay. Sounds good. Get them. Get them. Trust me.

Mean that the first thing go ahead. No. Go ahead. I was just gonna say, but that does mean, Jason, that the first encounter of the day, you wanna blow one spell slot of every every of every, rank of spell you have. So that way you're never going to after that, you're never gonna have a situation where you're not gonna be able to replenish at least one spell.

Mhmm. Oh, I'm gonna keep in mind. Alright. Here, are you that's the critical. No.

Nice shit. Oh. What what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what Oh, nice. Nice. Nice.

Came up to the cube to attack it, Yeah. Because we're He's pushed back five feet. Would that be possible to reroll? Reroll what? I still took half damage.

The damage? No. The only rerolls are on the d 20 is not on the damage. Yeah. Unless you have some special ability that does that.

I don't think so. I mean, I have that reroll thing, but I think it's only on that d 20. Yeah. It does push it back five feet, but it can't push it back five feet because Samir is there. So I'm not sure how that works.

I'll probably just Did he get his, flanking bonus? He did. Good. Yep. Yep.

Oh, boy. Did he Yes. Minus minus two. Yeah. Oh, incredible.

Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Can we take half from that? She took half damage because he's resistant to slicing Being tracked.

And piercing. Took half damage. So it's good that you're critical because you doubled the damage. Right. And he then halved.

Give me one second here. I'm gonna undo this. I guess I guess he is. Oh, and still seeing better days. Yeah.

Mhmm. Yeah. He's it is still up and he's still up and running, but, it's definitely, not, like a lot of the a lot of the mucus and stuff is starting to kind of fall away from the cube. It's starting to lose its shape. And Carsten, you're up.

I'm up. Get him. Get him. Well, I know. I think you've seen better days.

Carsten has as well. Yeah. I didn't say. I think he's had about 42 points of damage there. Oh, is he?

No. This ooze is. Oh, I'm not on the ooze. No. You're not.

No. I was talking to Cahir. Here we go. I'm gonna do a super strike and 16. Oh my gosh.

Here we go. I think I have one more. Wow. I think you do have a hero point. Last one.

Dumb. Not better. That's crit. Plus the extra 10, not a not a crit. Did you roll the critical?

No. Oh, you said the damage. Oh. Instead of the critical damage. Yeah.

Sorry. Go ahead and roll the crit damage. Oh, nice. That's better. Oh my gosh.

Yeah. Here. Oh, I forgot to roll my crit damage. And I went from fives to eights. Oh.

Right. Nicely damage. How how is this gonna kill them? Fives will kill them. Well, that would be worse.

And then I can move. Funny. There. Sweet. Alright.

Now we wait. I'm still, I'm still trying to tank the damage over here on this cube. That was that was my goal. So let's see how much I can do. Uh-huh.

This guy is actually going to go after Tahir. If he's got a prank, it's probably Well, it definitely ate a brain at one point. That's cool. It does a terrible reason. Cahir, I would like you to, roll that.

Okay. Alright. So you do succeed. And it's very sad. You do take six points of acid damage, as it tries to surge in and surround you, but you're able to fight it off with your giant ax that looks like it probably could use them.

It your ax is still very functional, but, it's definitely the the the wood of the haft is is starting to starting to melt, or decay rather. Howard, you're up. Alrighty. Wait. Wait.

Wait. What? It's kinda I have one more thing. I have one more action. He's going to he's going to attack.

It's going to attack in this. He had no more actions. There we go. It's going to attack to here, but miss him completely. Alright.

Now I worry you're up. Alright. Excellent. I will I, don't know. I'm pretty useless versus this thing.

I guess we'll electrocard it again. Sure. Why not? What would the boat do? Better.

Nice. Alright. Well, doesn't crit fail this time. Just regular fails. Yep.

That's fine. Uh-huh. Does some amount of damage. Wow. Yes.

Okay. And then He's not feeling good. Like, if you shot your bow, would it just engulf the arrow? I mean Maybe. Yes.

I could try, but, you know what? Sure. We'll see what happens. That's probably Which is it? Yeah.

Took the credit I'm not sure what else to do. So we'll we'll shoot it. We've not done this enough. Strike. Strike.

I did not strike. You did stretch. Or did I? You hit. Yeah.

Oh, I've just saw the four on the die and was like, okay. Alright. Yeah. There's no way. Right?

This thing this thing is a giant is a giant blob. It doesn't have where you can AC. So Yeah. Yeah. For sure.

Alright. I'll do some damage. Pew. Alright. Cool.

That's, that's me. K. Sameer, you're up. Let's let's do this one. This will be fun.

Yeah. It didn't there. There. This is 19 on the reflex. Alright.

Hail. Mhmm. That's interesting. It has everything. Is it immune to the sonic as well?

No. A lot of stuff. It's just the electric, but, you know It nullified the damage from the electric. Pretty much. Yeah.

Yeah. The way that resistance works in this game is it's you automatically it in in some systems it like halves damage if you've got resistance. In this system, it actually has a rank associated with that resistance, and it just always just knocks that amount of amount of hit points off every time. So if since you rolled a six in electric and it has resistance to electric and you did four damage with the sonic and the electric, you can ascertain exactly how much electric resistance it's got. I figured it had a plus five to the electric.

Right. So I don't know how I got a six. Well, I guess I don't know what the six is, but I don't know where that one is from. Yeah. You did six electricity damage.

I think it's I think that it's, like, the the magic is a plus one for for your electricity. So you rolled a five and it's plus one electricity, and then you rolled a three on Sonic. So that looks like what happened. Alright. So that was two actions.

What's your, what's your third? I taunted. Okay. You are faceless. You hideous.

You're you're pretty high intimidation for Yeah. Someone in the background. Yeah. No. Yeah.

Where is that here? Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.

Perform. Nope. What is that? I think it's in in demoralize. Yeah.

I have intimidation. Can I just roll intimidation by itself? Well, demoralize has specific things going on there. So Yeah. I want to demoralize it?

Yeah. I I would do the demoralize action. Oh, okay. Demoralize it is. You fluffy fart knocker.

I don't know what that means, but Okay. And that's going against its LDC, I believe. It means it did fail, or you succeeded rather. Not critically succeed, but you frightened it. You frightened the ooze.

Mhmm. Kinda weird. Oh. Yeah. Agree.

Alright. Okay. Here, you're up. Get them. Alright.

It's checks in DC just went down by one. Is that what I'm seeing? Mhmm. Yeah. Frightened basically gives you and gives the whoever's frightened a negative one on on everything.

That's fantastic. Man, there's that critical hit. How did it critical with a 10? It's gotta say it really has does not have good AC? It does not have good armor glass at all.

About a 10 AC. So anytime you get more than, you know, 10 points above that. Go bigger. So you lay into it again, but it it resists, or it doesn't resist. But, your your ax doesn't do as much damage as what you would expect.

But you need to add the guest door. Please. Do I need to roll the d 20 now for the Titan swing or after I try to hit again? Go ahead and roll it now. Oh my gosh.

Oh, you do actually you actually have a string metabolism now. Right. Me too. You join me. So you are in feebled one and clumsy one until you take a bite of food.

Okay. Now you can swing again at him. Oh, not in tightness wing one. You still hit. Oh, it's like you need to use a hero points with this thing.

Yeah. Let's go. Let's go. Oh, well. That's the worst.

You actually you actually only did 11 points damage because you still had Titan Swing turned on. But Yeah. Yeah. But let me let's reconfirm here real quick before I Should have only taken, like, five points of damage. K.

It takes it takes 11 points damage, and it and it does die. Cool. How do you want it how do you want to have killed this? I guess it my ax will get stuck in there and then somehow pull out its brain as I'm, like, pulling it out. Or pull out whatever keeps it alive.

I don't know. Right. And it pops like a water balloon. Alright. Cool.

Cool. Cool. Well, that is Food. The lobster food. Alright.

So there are a couple of things here. First off, you do get you do get x p's. Yeah. Congratulations. Hey.

And then there are a few things that you pick up, from that that basically just kind of pop into, that when, when the, when the gelatinous cube pops, there are a couple things that are, in in the key in the cube that have not been fully digested Oh. Just yet. Excellent. And those are in the chat there. There's a portion There.

A potion of cold retaliation lesser, a staff of air, aether marbles lesser Mhmm. And 50 gold pieces. I'm not too cold. Those gold. What the aether marble?

Oh, wow. Cold retaliation. We're good for our melees. Oh, tell me this is is this oh, no. Oh, wait.

Alright. I gotta go. Have a good night. Alright. Bye bye.

As well. Have a good night, Chris. That was fun. Thank you. Mister Henderson's leaving.

I didn't sleep. Good night. Alright. Have a good night, dude. We're already a little bit late.

Thank you. I'll see you. Oh, man. That staff of air is really nice. Mhmm.

Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Staff of air.

Yeah. Yeah. Mhmm. Oh, well, aether marbles. Oh, okay.

Cool. So how does how does, something like this where it's, you know, like, it's got spells on it that you would cast? Is that Yeah. It references charges, but it doesn't say how many charges it has or how they refill. I think that staffs in general have a set number of charges.

Let me Yeah. Give me a second. Maybe I can Oh, that's right. Craft. Okay.

Staff gauge charges when someone prepares for the day. Prepare to sniff and spread charges. Okay. You can only catch the spell you have in your spell list. Oh, you have to have the spelling in your list in order to do it?

Yeah. So you don't have to know the spell, but it has to be on your list. So it has to be an arcane spell for you, for example. Oh, I see. Or or whatever your your, origin is because it's not necessarily arcane for sorcerer.

His is his is arcane. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Mhmm. You use your stuff for it. Okay. Preparing a staff.

Do that staff gains a number of charges equal to the rank of your highest spouse slot. Oh, that's cool. So they, like, scale. That is neat. So for us, it would have two, two charges.

One for first and one for cantrip? Because that's what's on this particular staff? I think No. Cantrip, if you just use it Exactly. And then the first level spells would take, one charge each.

Right. So you could use, you know, one of each a day or one twice or whatever. Yep. Oh, so it's not like, you use the spell and it's gone from the staff. You would have to, like, recreate it to get the spell back on it.
