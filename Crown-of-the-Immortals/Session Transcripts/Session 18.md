You. You can roll from one. Yeah. So if you if you just go to your crafting, and you're not looking at recall knowledge repair craft or any of that, just click on the crafting, header, that should roll it. That's that's very different.

Okay. Alright. So I'm not putting any modifiers or anything else in here. We're just doing it normal. Right?

Right. Oh, I I got a nine. Okay. Wait. Wait.

You you need to use your thingy. Zero point. Got it. Oh, he would've gotten I think I got 19. Where is my button to reroll?

Yeah. I don't know. If you right click on the back. Right click it. Right.

There you are. Reroll using zero point. Even better. Yep. It is.

It's always better. Yeah. If you're using the 20 it will always be better, unless you happen to roll an 18 because you're just clicking. And are searching for a 20 or something. Alright.

So you had a 21 to craft the vessel. You are able to you're able to create a submersible, and apply, and apply the fire resistance potion as kind of like a it it was we we worked into kind of like a fire resistant car. And so that was that was how you were able to, get the submersible to, be fire resistant. What you have is, effectively a wood, sub. And I hope we used white oak for it.

For that role? Maybe? Maybe it's made out of yew wood. I wouldn't need that either. So you guys have a submarine now.

Yay. Submarine. So who's driving this sucker? I mean, what do you what skills do you need to drive it? It's going to be, so I would allow either a straight either straight agility, a reflex save, or or crafting.

And no. I'm sorry. Not straight agility. Either an acrobatics, a crafting, or a reflex safe. I have a plus seven to my acrobatics.

Dude, or crafting. Technically, any of us probably could do that. So who wants to drive a submarine? Go ahead, Clark. Alright.

What do you mean? I don't care. I will drive a submarine or I will this one. That. Don't bother me.

I'll do whatever. Alright. Alright. Guess I'm driving. Yeah.

Yeah. So, Clark, I'm going to need okay. So you guys are going to be creating a distraction to get the buying shark's attention Mhmm. Elsewhere. You're going to be trying to, drive this submersible, behind them while they're distracted and into the temple's entrance.

Is that correct? Yep. Alright. So, sounds like Ramsey, do your magic. Mhmm.

Yep. Sec. I do my magics. I cast a second level illusory object. Kill.

So, yeah, within 500 feet. So I can put it a decent way away from the sub. Wow. That's crazy. Yeah.

Nice job. You get the gold star for today. Well, we'll see if it works. It doesn't you get fired for today. Oh, I think we all get fired.

What is that? Will we have a boiling party? This is the question. Right? Right?

Yummy meats. Super Mhmm. Alright. So you, so okay. And, Clark, I will need a, a sub piloting tech.

So either Blue. Blue. Crafting, agility, or no. Crafting. Did you test that skill?

Or we he did. Ramsey, did you give us a plus one? I mean, yeah. I can do that too. It's just a cam trip.

So Yes. You should. Uh-huh. Yep. I sure can.

Bam. Right. And I added that. Here we go. Boom.

Hey. It's pretty good. That's not bad. Mm-mm. That's very good.

I'll take it. I used that one a little bit earlier. That's, like, six times better than what I rolled. Oh, I mean, I'm gonna take it for now, but realize that statistically speeding will not roll like that. Oh.

Right. So you get you get down, into the, into the water. How were you cast your illusionary charm to produce a dead body? The brine sharks. We forgot to check if Smog was still alive.

Who? Smog the dragon. I hope. He's probably dead. Awesome.

The the brine sharks, which is what the o p's look like Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. I do remember. Immediately take the bait, especially with your, Ramsey, can you roll a performance Absolutely.

Just to, you know, make it more analyzing. You better perform well. Yep. Yep. Yep.

Yep. Yep. Yep. Skills. Reformance.

Where are you? There you are. Perform. Interesting. I guess I don't know why this is coming up.

But, sure, I guess this is acting. Acting works. Alright. Yeah. So they Oh, you're asking.

Pretty good. Yeah. Okay. That's really good. So, yeah, the the brine sharks that you are attempting to distract to make the hole to get into the temple, do in fact take the bait.

Oh. And they go after, they go after your illusion. Yeah. Yeah. You are able to slip by the fine sharks and enter into the entrance of The cave?

The entrance of the temple. Excellent. You when you get into the into the temple, Karsten, you specifically, notice that this temple is still underwater. So there's, you haven't gotten into any area where you where there's breathable air at this point. Mhmm.

But what you do see is a long chamber, that has a number of colored glyphs that are flashing at regular intervals. As you pull as you pull into the, into the temple entrance. Your submersible is not huge, but it is unwieldy in this area. I mean, you're effectively in a, in a extra large canoe effect at this point. But you do see a number of different glyphs, in through the hallway, that that, again, appear to be, flashing at, different intervals.

What do you do? I will communicate that I see some flashing lights on the or flashing glyphs and that we could should go that way to we should shimmy that way to go see what they are or if we can read them. They're okay. So for the rest of you, when when he points that out, you kinda look at it. The flashing glyphs are, are appearing along the corridor.

Okay. And yeah. So and there's not really a lot of this isn't like the temple that you were at, the Temple Of Shanuanua, where there were a bunch of different options of places to go. It's very clearly just like A corridor? One corridor to proceed forward.

Gotcha. And we can't fit, and our our submarine can't fit? You can fit. There's just kind of, you know, it's unusual glyphs that are flashing along the along the length of the corridor. Doesn't look, doesn't look great.

Or did it looks suspicious. That's what he's saying. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Which is why I mentioned it. I don't think I have, Samir, do you have any Detect Magic? I do have Detect Magic. Oh, you do?

Sick. I thought I did. Not. But I had that. Maybe.

Or maybe Samir does. I do. Yep. I can I can Well, then you do it? I thought I had it too, but maybe I really don't.

Testing detect imagine x. Just to see what we're working with out there is Hold me. Magical. Alright. So now pull this.

This is Patrick. Because it's an emanation? No. Okay. Man.

But, yeah, if if it had a range, it would actually double the range, but an emanation doesn't have a range. Mhmm. K. Right. So so I do detect magic, and you definitely do detect magic on the glyphs.

Mhmm. Just trying to I don't need it before that. I said, so this is this is unclear wording to me. Maybe I'm being maybe I'm not understanding it. But does it allow you to determine what type of magic it is as well?

It says you receive information no information beyond the presence or absence of magic. Yep. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

It was the little it was little thing about the detect illusion magic. I was like, it says it. You know? Okay. Good.

Good. Good. So what you are able to determine is that those magic those glyphs themselves are indeed magical glyphs. They are when they when they flash, there's a giant flare of magic. And when they fade, the the magic the magic itself dissipates.

So it's just kind of like a like, twinkle lights. Twinkle lights that do something or twinkle lights that don't do anything? Oh, I know. They're twinkling. They're twinkling.

I'm aware. Are they are they twinkling different colors? Did you say? Or are they all the same color? They're all the same color.

Albert, can you roll a performance check? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well, I'm not gonna roll. Thinking.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So as I as Al were, like, sees the, the the lights blinking, I was gonna take out my, my little, whatever it is, my small little guitar and start, my loot, start scrolling along, through whatever pattern I'm seeing. I'm like, I mean, we are the temple of the music god.

So, is this a beat? You do in you do indeed discover that it is a beat. Mhmm. There is a rhythm. So Feel on it.

If yeah. So if you time things just right, you feel like there's a there's a path to get through the corridor while those while those, glyphs are not alight. So it's kind of like it's kind of like if you perform the right dance moves, you you should be able to get through there. Okay. It will be a little bit more complicated being that you are in a submarine.

Right now, baby. Here we go. But you can effectively dance your way across the corridor is is what you think is supposed to be happening there. Okay. Awesome.

Well, you're the one driving, so that can be a problem. Oh, man. I'm kind of very white. I'm kind of instructing cars to them. Like, okay.

This is the beat. You know? And I'm, like, playing it out. I'm like, alright. On this, go.

Alright. So I'm going to need I'm gonna need Oh, swap it on one and threes. It's two and fours, not one and threes. Come on. You're right.

Okay. Okay. So I'm gonna need a, performance check from, from, our for his instruction. Sure. Sure.

Should actually be a two. Alright. That that that's pretty good. Okay. Excellent.

So going so, Carson, you will get, let's see here. Because you are in a submarine, you are clumsy too. However, due to Alwar's instruction, you gain a plus two to your, to your driving check. And, yeah, I'm I'm assuming that you are you are still inspired as well. So, you get a plus one from that.

So in total, you'll get a plus three to your driving the submarine check. I think it went down. What? My acrobatics was at seven, and now it's at five. Because you're clumsy too.

Yep. Why am I clumsy? That's right. You're because you're dancing with a submarine. Oh, that's just silly.

Oh, I can't use this sir. Oh, oh, sorry. Just a minute. Okay. Two Maybe.

Oh, man. Taking a second. Oh, there we go. Add oh, mate. One more.

One more. One more. This is this is this is just a special oh, there we go. I get it. I did it.

I did it. Okay. Here we go. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Oh, here we go. Red team. Alright. Here we go.

I'm dancing tonight. We're good. Not bad. My armor. So you with with how where's, instruction, you are in fact able to maneuver it, maneuver the sub, through the corridor.

In my head canon, the the song that was playing was we all live in a yellow submarine. Yeah. Yeah. That works. Brilliant.

So you're able to you're able to make it make it through. There were a few really close calls, but, you were able to save yourself at the very last minute. As you get at the end of the corridor Hey. Don't tell me I gotta go get a snack. Okay.

The suspense. I mean, what do you mean? Say it. All this. Excuse me.

I need class. I got that right, didn't I? Alright. Ready. Mac was calling my name before we headed into the Temple Of Doom.

There's a couple of songs and wonderfulness. Dancing like a yahoo or a yahoo depending on your interpretation. Alright. So for the next part, I'm gonna need your guys' assistance. I'm already dancing.

I know. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So give me one second here to, prep things.

Mhmm. Grab those things. You should all be receiving quotes here Mhmm. Pretty soon if you haven't already gotten one. And it should make sense once, once I get that once I'm able to get that to everybody.

I apparently might have all of my Alright. You get to the end of the corridor, and, the and you do indeed at the end of the corridor, you see when you look up that there is a there is a small air pocket followed by a ledge. You are able to get your submersible all the way up into that air pocket. And when you break when you break the water, you see a, you see a room. It it is, dome it is a dome of mirrored water, floating lights and and floating lights.

There are a number of different columns. This this temple, much like the Temple Of Shanonua, looks like a more of like a Middle Eastern style temple, domed ceilings and the like. And that's basically kinda what you see. You see, like, a mirrored glass ceiling dome, and a number of different columns that are basically just supporting that dome, within there. And the ground is is, solid is solid marble.

If you wish to get out of the boat, you can do that, or you can ground. Yeah. Heck yeah. I'm I'm definitely getting out. Alright.

Checking this place out. I'm standing in this boat, just so you know. Just staying in the boat. Okay. No.

I'm getting out. Oh, okay. I, stay in the boat if you want to. Be the gateway driver. I immediately test the acoustics of the room.

Yep. I'm under firmware. Like like, just let out, like, a sustained pitch. Yep. As you do, you you hit the ground, you let out that that note the note reverberates throughout the room.

This is definitely a, the the acoustics in this in this dome are point are on point. Yeah. Yeah. Awesome. Right right after that right after that note that you that you, cast out, you are taken up in a vision.

Whoo. And this is the part that I'm gonna need your help with. I'm going to be describing your vision, but I'm going to be giving you the opportunity I'm gonna be giving you the opportunity to read out the quote that I gave you in, in the chat. Oh, I know. So for you, Alwar, you find yourself, in a similar chamber to this one.

The air is thick with salt and metal as you as you, clad in robes, etched with shimmering etched with a shimmering script, stand at the base of the temple's such central pillar. Your voice hummed at the final notes of the lino, a harmony so perfect it made the air vibrate. As, you drive your blade into the stone dais, obsidian weapon wrapped in orichalcum wire or an orichalcum wire and humming with stored resonance. You murmur, here's your quote. Excellent.

So I I I got a picture of, like, our muttering this out loud as he kind of comes out of his vision. Says, let the truth wait for the world to be ready. He's kind of stared down at his empty hand where the sword just wasn't his vision. Yeah. Perfect.

And and, and a memory of the blade vanishing into the stone pillar, and sealing, and sealing with it the memory of, of your sacrifice. Alright. So yeah. So yeah. You and this this, this vision that you have is it's not so much it's not so much something that has happened to somebody else that you're remembering.

You know that this is this is your memory. This is something that's specific to you. Oh, okay. As you stare as you stare at your hands where the sword once was. Okay.

I mean, it was a long time, I guess. I might have forgotten some things. Rest rest of you hear him murmuring something to himself. Yeah. Yeah.

So the room was like this one? It was like this one, but it was not this one. So this one Okay. Distinctly not this one. Okay.

Yeah. The the central pillar that you remembered in your vision is not present here. Okay. Who else wants to get out of the who who else wants to get out of the submarine? I'm getting out of the submarine.

Yeah. Alright. I wanna get out. Yeah. Scott, you're first.

I'll hold it up. I'm staring at the plane. Okay. So, yeah, you you look out. You see, the you know, Albert kinda looking at his hands a little bit, just kind of confused, kinda talking to himself a little bit.

And you step from the, from the submarine onto the onto the stone, onto the marble ground. And immediately, you find yourself, you find yourself in a chamber filled with carved solar motifs. You see a bronze pillar in front of you, and you remove your orichalcum circlet from your brow, the crown of rulership, and set it upon the pedestal of molten brass. You whisper the whisper I gave you. We were kings once.

Kings must burn away before light can rise again. As you say that, the circlet sinks into the metal. The flame within dimmed. You stood for a long time, not as a king, but as a sentinel, and turned your back on the past. This is a vision I'm having too, though, or is this real?

This is a vision. It it's this is a vision that you're having as well. Again, this is something like, you know, you don't recognize like, you recognize that place, but you recognize it from it's kind of like a deja vu sort of thing. It's like, I know this this is my memory, but I have no memory of this memory kind of thing. Mhmm.

Carson. Yes. Leaving the leaving the, leaving the submarine, you oh, just really quick. I'm sorry. Scott, what is what is Cahir's immediate response to what just happened to him?

What's his reaction? Yeah. I think he'd be stuttered a little bit and kind of just, like, wondering what that meant, maybe. Yeah. So, yeah, you so, Carson, you're getting out and you're like, you're basically you're kinda seeing what happened with our you know, he's kinda looking at he's kinda looking at his hands, contemplating things.

And here, basically, just kinda breezes and looks confused a little bit what right when he right when he gets off of the, right when he gets off the submarine. And if I'm describing, you know, what what you guys are doing incorrectly, please do let me know because we can like, really, it's your character's response. You can you can respond any way you want. But, but, Carson, you you step onto the, arbol as well, and you find yourself standing, in a a dais. Not a dais so much as a balcony.

I don't even know what a dais is. Oh, good. You're on a balcony. That's Thank you. I've never even heard of that term.

I I will not use I will not use the word dais to confuse you. The balcony. I learned new words. A balcony of of a temple. You see the rolling the rolling sand dunes in the distance.

You turn a step into the temple itself. And as you do, lightning splits across the sky beyond the cracked ceiling of the hall. Your gauntlets etched with runes that once bent the desert wind to your will lay across the lap of a statue, shaped shaped in your image. Good. Your, your quote, please.

I broke armies with this, but we break nothing today. You press your hands into the statue's chest, whispering a single line of the Lenot that bound the artifact to in into stasis. The wind fell still, unnaturally still. And, Sameer, are you, are you the gateway driver? Up to this point, I guess I am.

I am I'm I'm just I didn't end the detect magic thing, so I don't know how long that lasts or if it would still be going, but I would be, like, I'd be looking. I'm watching with that lens. Yeah. You you definitely do see magic happening, in this place. It's almost like, it like, as as you see each of your friends step into this this place, you see a flash of some sort of magic.

Although it doesn't seem to be something that you like, it's not a common it's not like, oh, that's magic. It's like, woah. What's that? You know? Okay.

Sort of situation. Harsten, do you have any immediate reactions to your vision? Yeah. I'm stunned because I don't understand the totality of what I'm looking at or saying or why I'm pressing my hand into the chest. You know?

Does that make sense? Like, I'm like, I'm trying to figure out real quick, like, what is really going on with the small pieces. So I'm kinda very confused, cautiously confused, but excited at the same time, like, all rolled into one. Yeah. Absolutely.

Mhmm. Does that make sense? Yeah. No. That makes that makes perfect sense.

So so, like, an immediate or a visible reaction would be kind of, like, would you be stunned, or would you be, like, being really excited? Or I think I would be, like, really kinda stunned excited because I'm not understanding what everything means, but it seems cool. Does that make sense? But I am stunned. That for sure.

Okay. And then what is this? Yeah. So you like, again, Sameer, kind of what you're seeing is you're you're you have, you know, a couple of different reactions, but they they none of nobody seems to be, like, in pain. There's a little bit of confusion.

There's a little bit of, like, what's going on? And, you know, you see Karsten and you and he's he's got a he's got a confused flash. He's got a confused smile on his face. Like, you know, well, this could be cool, but I don't know what it is kinda thing. Yeah.

Mhmm. Mhmm. That's fascinating. Just, Arwal, what did you do? I I didn't do anything yet or again or I don't know.

Play another note. Play another one? Okay. Yeah. And I'll, yeah.

Yeah. Sure. We'll, we'll, like, start playing a little a little ditty. Alright. Did it walk back to Diane?

Sorry. Oh, no. I wasn't gonna get there. Yeah. The acoustics in here are amazing.

But other than just having the best the best natural amplifier that you could possibly ever want, nothing of note specifically happens. K. And Okay. Samir does not notice any additional magic. Okay.

Right? K. Yeah. I mean, like, pop out and assuming we are looking to explore a little bit more. Okay.

So you you jump onto the floor as well. And as you actually enter the room itself, you likewise have, been picking up in a vision. You stand before the temple's mirrored pool. You held you you hold a small obsidian mirror framed in decorated archalcum filigree, Its surface already dimming. You whisper to it, not in words, but in truths.

Who they were, what they lost, what must be forgotten. The mirror shimmered, then darkened, as if swallowed as if swallowing the memories whole. We place it beneath the water. And here's your quote. Let none see until the world can understand.

And with that, as you are all, as you are all brought together, you realize that all four of you have been here before, That's right. But you have not been here before. You worked together to seal a portion of the Leno in this very temple. But that was long ago, before you were born, before the blessed realm existed, the ancient, in an ancient time, that time has forgotten. Cool.

Cool. Cool. She's playing tricks on us. That temple goddess. Guys, I think I might be older than I think.

The what? I forgot it might be older than I think. I did too. I forgot how old I'm supposed to be. Keeps staring at me.

He's not old. Not not that old, but I have forgotten. I was supposed to be kinda up there Okay. By human standards. Hey.

You're an elf, aren't you? Half. You're half elf. So I I was gonna watch somebody else kind of, like, fade into their their their vision as they step out. It's it's weird.

Yeah. So I I I I guess you all saw that. It was the same thing? Did he have a a sword or something else? I did not see a sword.

Okay. Me. Yeah. Saw me too, but I had a sword. I did not have a sword.

Okay. Are we supposed to explain our visions to each other? Like, help me do whatever you want with what you've been given here. Yeah. Okay.

I didn't I didn't know where to go with that. I mean, I would repeat or describe what I saw. And, Chris, you will have to if people need details, I don't remember them. Yep. So so the subject of each one of your each one of your visions is some sort of object that belonged to you in the past.

Or the objects that you had were a pair of gauntlets. Oh, yeah. Do any of our crafters know what orichalcum is? Well, so that that's that's a good question. I would say that if some if anybody who has a crafting skill, or I would even let this fall under Bartic knowledge.

If you want to roll that skill, then you can, if you get a 20 or above, you know what oraclecum is. Excellent. I will definitely give that a shot. And, oh, hey. Holy crap.

Do I get a bonus? You do not get a bonus, but, you I'm rerolling mine. No. What are we rolling for? No something.

Knowing anything. If you re if you have or if you have want to know what oraclecum is, which is the metal that is repeatedly pulling up in your, Visions. Visions, then you can pull up your crafting to do that. Every like, this metal is in everyone's vision. Right?

Right. To here, you could also use your allure plane of metal as well. And if you'd use your allure plane of metal, I would I would say that you would, you your your your your numb your target number is, a 17 or above because it's specifically about metal. So you'd have a better chance at that. Makes sense.

Self close. Point. Use a hero point. Self close. No.

Okay. Why? It's 09:00. Use a hero point. Alright.

So for those of you that hit the target number, you know or Telkom is a extremely rare metal. It's usually of a orangish gold color. It is, also known as sunsteel. Oh. And it is something that is, believed to be a, divine metal of, of Raythellion.

Oh. For those of you that know what Orichalcum is, you have seen or you have seen Orichalcum, here and there. You know? Like, there's there are elements of, like, oraclecum that have been a part of the busted realm. Like, they've, you know, they put it on they put it on things for decoration and that kind of stuff from time to time.

However, you have never seen anything as pure and as vibrant as the oraclecum that you saw in your vision. It's like Mhmm. It's like there's apparently, there's oraclecum and then there's oraclecum. And the items that you had in your visions were of the latter. So it makes you wonder as to whether or not you ever actually did know what orichalcum was because these are very different sorts of things.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So this is a different orichalcum than we're used to because it's pure. Right.

So the stuff that you've seen, it's it's an orangish metal, but, they're it's kind of like the difference between real gold and fool's gold kind of thing. It's like, well, you know, that they called it orichalcum, but was it really? I don't know. I don't know. Yep.

Oh, okay. But I even but even still, it's so rare of a metal that the stuff that you have seen, you you've only seen rarely in in, very rich places. Yep. I mean, do they mine it? How do you get it?

There are oracle campaigns that have existed in the past. There's no nobody's just happened across the a chunk of it in a very long time. So traditionally, unless you're given given it by a deity somehow, you can find it in the natural world, but it's very difficult. Very rare. Yes.

Yeah. Gotcha. Okay. So yeah. So Karsten does a little bit of, does a little bit of verbal processing, kind of giving giving this giving the download of kind of what he saw, in his vision.

Anybody else have anything that they want to? Yeah. For sure. I'll I'll kind of recount mine as well. Look.

I don't I don't know what this means. I are we all reincarnated? Did we all come back? I mean, we were chosen clearly. Like, I let, like, the white out from our, abilities.

Right. Right. Well, maybe the answers would be here somewhere. I would share mine too. Chris, what was my object?

I've forgotten. You had a you had a Oratelkam crown. Okay. So that makes sense. And we would all share our parts or whatever and what we were given.

Mhmm. Yeah. Definitely. Quotes and things. Yep.

Yeah. Had a black obsidian glass mirror. Pretty freaking sweet looking. Anyway, names and faces seen in it disappeared, forgotten, and then set it down in water, and away it goes. Kirsten, what was your object again?

Gauntlets. But I have no idea what they do. You had an impression from the, from your vision, that they had something to do with controlling the wind. Oh, I can control fire, and now I can control the wind. Well, I mean, the gauntlets can I can't?

Okay. I would explain that to or reiterate that to here. Can we tell how long this thing has been in the water? Is there any way to get this temple floating? This temple appears to not have been in the water very long at all.

Okay. It's, there's very, very little, water, water damage to it. It looks like it it looks like it was a desert temple at some point, but, again, you know, it just kind of, like, appears to be magically preserved. How big is the space that we're standing in? The space that you're standing in right now is the it's solid 60 foot diameter, circle with a domed top.

There is a, there is a oh, come on. There is a there's a exit to the on the opposite side of the room, where your sub basically kinda popped up, there's a stairway that goes up to this this room. Then at the far edge of the room, there is a, a ornately decorated door, that is closed. I'm not. Okay.

Okay. Did anyone see anything that looks familiar here? No. Yeah. Okay.

Me either. Is there, like, paintings on the walls? Like, are those There there are. Or matching No. Is there is what I meant to say?

There there are definitely murals around, mostly, related to the god Cadence, so specifically around music, around, composition, and and those sorts of things. This is a temple of the god of music, so, it would be unfitting for there not to be, things on there. But there's nothing that specifically references you if that's what you're looking for. Right. Right.

Correct. We all had an initial vision when we stepped on the marble, but we come out of them kind of shortly. Right? Right. Right.

So you have the vision. Once it's once it's passed, you're back in the present. Each one of those visions does feel like a memory, though. And like I said, after everybody had stepped on there, you had this realization that you, as a group, have been in this temple before. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. So not just have we been here, but we remember all being here. Right. Excellent.

Excellent. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.

Cool. Cool. Alright. Well, maybe we'll remember more. That's alright.

Someone mentioned in the back of the head. Mentioned they were singing or humming or something in their vision. Right, Chris? That's Someone had a bit of piano, you said? Yeah.

Well, actually, all four of you had a bit of it. Oh, interesting. Okay. But I don't none of you yeah. But but none of you actually remember you remember saying it, but you don't remember the words.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Okay. Gotcha. Okay. Cool. Cool.

Cool. Cool. But yeah. Like, basically, effectively, what, these visions show you sacrificing something of great value and using a line of the, you know, to, to to seal it, for for a time in the future Yep. When it's needed again.

K. Resting. Alright. Alright. Well, I think we should keep going.

So nothing else to do. Right, Chris? Obviously, very weird. But, I'm Right. Right.

Yep. Nothing else to do except reflect on the weirdness of what just happened. So Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

Like, we can't figure out what those things or where those things are. Oh, man. No. Doesn't look familiar to me at the moment. Feel like a real.

You you remember you remember where you placed them, or you remember what you placed them on, and none of those things are here. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Cool.

Cool. Yeah. Yeah. Let's, let's go to the door. Yep.

Yep. I I think so. You go to the door, and open it. Beyond that door, you see a another room. As you open the door, the the torches on the sconces all around the room just start magically lighting.

Okay. It's a stone, it's a stone room not nearly as, ornate as the room that you came out of with all of the tapestries and murals and the marble floor and the glass ceiling. You know? You walk into this room, and it's more of a a, more of a more of a, monk's cell sort of feel to it, A place where you can it's it's almost the other side of of creativity, whereas the room before you was about the performance and about, you know, all of the all of the, all of the external expressions of of the creativity of song. This room is about, this room is about that place where you where a creative person has nothing but themselves and and the paper that they're writing on, to produce the to produce the the music for those grand performances.

So, it's a very different style of room, but they feel similar and close. Mhmm. At the center of the room, you do see a a desk, and at that desk sits a, what appears to be a, blonde haired, appears to be a blonde haired, half elf in his, in his human equivalents of thirties or forties. He's writing down something or he's working on a composition at the desk, and he looks up and says, oh, you're back. I must I must say it took a little bit longer than I expected.

Me too. What is this guy again? He's a blonde half elf. Sitting in this room? Allegedly.

No. Allegedly. So elf's projecting himself into this room. So what brings you here? Well, I've been, working on this composition, and he, all he shuffles through some papers, pulls out, like, yeah.

I think this is I think this is my best one. And he hands it out and he hands it over to you to take a look at it. Oh, eagerly. You know what I'm gonna say? I am inept.

So We, do we get any feelings as we kinda enter and see him? Your general feelings in this room are that of peace and serenity. Do we think do I think he's like a divine being? All indications would point to that being the case, considering the location and where you're at and that kind of thing. And while he's alone under the water?

Yeah. You don't often see a bunch of half elves just hanging out in in a temp in a temple underneath the water. How many are there? Is there just there more than one? Just one.

Just one. Okay. Okay. You okay. This and this room is about it's about 40 it's about, you know, 30 by 40.

So it's a pretty large room, but there is just the one desk in the center. It does have a, it does have, he wasn't just sitting there in the dark while, you know, working on this. Like, there at the desk, there is, a, a lantern and a few candles that he appeared to be working by. And when we came in, he said, I'm glad you're back. Yeah.

He said, welcome back. Took you longer to get here than I expected. And then he handed a piece of sheet music over to, over to Outward. You take a look at this sheet music, and this is one of the, like, this is a masterpiece is is what it is. Like, it's not, you know, it's not quite to the level of of, you know, the song of creation, the piece of the song of creation that you saw.

But as far as, like, works of what appears to be immortal, like, this is, like, top tier, talent here. While while he's kind of doing doing that, I mean, I would ask the question. Could you please elaborate on your statement? Well, when last we met, you were, well, you were sealing up sealing a portion of the, of the, song, of the song of creation, at least if that if you are who I think you are, have the same feel about you, but your looks are slightly different. Yeah.

You're talking about all four of us. When is that time period? All of those things. All four of you have been here. Yeah.

The impression. Yeah. I got that impression. That's the thing I'm gonna say. And we don't remember that.

Well, correction. We started to remember that, when we got here, but not until then. That yes. I imagine that is somewhat confusing. I guess you're not as far along as you could be.

Well I I kind of, like, shakily handed the piece of paper back to him. My hand, like, visibly trembling. Sir, I I suspect I might know who you are. Am I correct? And I kind of, like, start to kneel.

At that, he he he does he does stop you, and he says Okay. No. No. No. No.

I am not I am not Cadence. K. Okay. I I'm his, what's the word? Assistant.

Harold okay. Is a representation of his will. He who knows his his inner, his his inner thoughts, the the way he communicates directly to the to the world, but I am not him. Okay. Alright.

Well My my name is Aubadeo. Did you say Aubadeo? Chris. Yes. Are we crossing the streams?

We may or may not be cross country. There's Excellent. Excellent. There could be correlation. Alright.

Alright. Necessarily have to be the case. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. I just gotta sit there as I hand it back to him and say, well, I, I have a new answer for when someone asks me where I will see myself in ten years. Right back here. Where do you see yourself?

Right back here. K. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah.

I need help. I don't know what else to say other than I don't know what to say. Why am I coming back again? What's going on? Where are those gauntlets?

You know, all of those things in a very polite way. He asking all those things in a very polite way. Yeah. Like a reverent, like, you know, like like, he is someone special, and I recognize that even though I'm still ignorant. Well, he, if if all of your parting questions, he he basically well, first off, he, you know, introduces himself.

He says, while I am while while I am his herald, I'm definitely I definitely do not have his his mind, but I do, he does speak to me. I speak for him. I have waited a long time for you to return as there needed to be someone standing guard over this, over this piece of the lanol. And as, my, benefactor was to keep guard of it guard on it, it I was honor bound to stay. As As far as your questions around your, your items, they are in the room beyond, as well as the, the the bars of the of the that you used those items to seal.

Oh. In order to get there, however, I recognize you as who you are. You must prove that you are who you are to the, to the great magics that seal the Leno, or it will Mhmm. For it will not open for anybody except for you. That's encouraging.

Okay. The way that you can, way that you can use or the way that you can prove your your identity is to, speak a truth explaining why you must reclaim the Leno. Oh. And or the it's it's Yano, isn't it? It's not Lenon.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's like the the the Spanish.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yano.

Roughly. Don't worry. I'm sure I'm not pronouncing it right either, but Oh, is it yeah. Yeah. Poor Clark, he had all these weird words thrown at him.

He's right now. That's why I don't say him anymore. It's just, like, whatever. You just make the best out of everything. I make the best.

I really try. So, yes, you must you must speak truth or, you must speak a a truth explaining why you must let reclaim the and do so, in a way that only you, the previous you, would would know. So I'm I'm trying to he like, he he explains it better than I do. But effectively, like, you're, you have to have some sort of passphrase that that you say that is a representative of why you need why you need the, you know, now based off of the, based off of who you were in your previous life. So, basically, the vision, you have to take part of that vision to be able to, you know, explain your need.

That makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. And if it is helpful, I will pass those visions out, the full write up of the visions out. Do you want it in Discord or in the chat?

Whatever. I'll throw them up in Discord in the story beats section. Uh-huh. You said story beats? Yep.

Okay. Okay. Okay. I need to listen across the screen. It doesn't make any sense to me.

I don't know what to do with the wind. Where, is it we must prove ourselves? At the, at the door itself. Ah, I see. Can we just prove ourselves just getting down here?

That's FYI. Anybody anybody with anybody with some gumption can have made it this far. No. I think your overestimating those crazy sharks. Yeah.

That's funny. I I I I think that you might be over complicating what what's being asked. Almost certainly. So alright. Alwar will will walk up to the door, and I'm kind of, like, as I'm going, I'm he's humming to himself, the the song, that that Argyle showed him just a little bit ago.

And I kind of I kind of reach the door, and, I kind of mimic putting my hand up to it as if, you know, I was still holding a blade, And kind of like if I kinda slowly draw back, till say, I I don't know if the world is ready, but I know that it needs it. We we need the song to repair the time turner. I don't know what it means for the world to be ready, but I believe that I am. And with that, a glowing sigil that looks like a sword appears on the door. Right.

Kinda look back a little excited. Alright. Who's next? I have no idea how you got your answer. Meryl walk up to the door, which has been forgotten and lost is to be restored.

Excuse me. And with that, a, what looks to be a sigil of a or a, what looks to be a picture of a mirror, appears at as a glyph on the door as well. I guess I will walk up to the door and say, I broke armies with this. We break nothing today. The I pressed my hand or maybe not.

I just So, you you're you're you are almost there. Just to like, basically, you that's that's definitely mostly what what we're looking for, but you need to explain your need with those with those words. Mhmm. So, like, as Sameer said, you know, the the, you know, the light or what was it? The That was what they lost.

And though it's been forgotten, it needs to be restored. Right. And The original phrase was who they were, what they lost, and what me what must be forgotten. So kinda taking the inverse of those statements. Exactly.

Yeah. So I'm gonna need help because that makes no sense to me in my project. Okay. Okay. Well, I don't I don't want to I I don't wanna You're not alone, Mark.

Yeah. So okay. So for for, for Karsten with what he has, like, so in in his vision, the winds the the winds die down, and he says, we're you know, we will break nothing today. I broke armies with this, but we'll break nothing today. You could say something like, the world is the world is broken, and we need and we need to and this song will repair it or, you know, something like that.

Like, you you could basically just flip it around to, like, we are broken. We need to fix it rather than where I I was breaking stuff with this. Now I'm now I'm going to now we're we're not going to break anything. Does that make sense? It does make sense.

Where I get confused is I don't understand the purpose of the gauntlets other than they are associated with some kind of wind and they do something. So I I feel like I'm missing a bunch of information, which is why I just think I'm struggling a lot with this. Okay. Well, I mean well, I mean, none of these none of these magic items really are represented are are really something that anybody really understands what what they do. Okay.

So, what the what the gauntlet to do doesn't matter in the context of what they do right now. Yeah. Yep. Something like, you know, about the king, about the people. So each person is their, you know, place of, like, I think it was, like, a royal priestess kinda thing or, you know, I guess, I'm off.

No. I I don't think I don't think that's I don't think that's wrong. Like, I mean, from what I hear about what you're wanting to say is it's it's more along the lines of, like Power to the people. Time for, yeah, it's time for the kings to rise again, you know, or or something like that, you know, or something, you know, something to that effect. How would it you know?

And so that, so, basically, you know, the, you know, your your royal priesthood comment or, you know, what, you know, what what have you, when you say when you say that, it, the the crown appears on the door as well. And Hey. I'm gonna give it a second try. Okay. You can do it, Clark.

I believe in you. Yeah. Thanks. I broke armies with these gauntlets, but today, I bring unity and peace. Here we go.

Alright. I will take that. So, yeah, you with that, you see a sigil of or not sigil, but, like, a a carving picture of two gauntlets appear on the door. And then the door cracks open, and you hear a scraping noise of stone against stone as they as they open inward to reveal a, to reveal a Treasure room. Treasure room.

Oh. Or a vault. I don't know. You see in that room, a statue, the man sitting with two gauntlets on his lap. You see a, you see a basin full of water, that has a mirrored surface on it.

You see a stone pedestal that has, that has a lot more weather weather worn look about it than anything else that you see in this temple. It looks like it's been really heavily worn. The the column itself is about is about three and a half feet tall. And then you also see a, a brass column that is about five feet tall that stands, that stands to the, off to the side. All three or all four of these things, the statue, the basin, on a pedestal, a stone pillar or stone, yeah, stone pillar, and a brass column.

They all, are four corners of a square. And inside the square, floating in the air with a ray of light that is, that is pointed directly at it, you see a, a scroll. Yep. Without hesitation. Giddy and excited.

I run up to that sucker. As you run into the, into the square Yeah. Yeah. You are immediately pushed back as if you hit a wall. Yeah.

Yeah. And fly back to the the opposing wall, hitting it pretty hard. You do take damage with it, but, not enough to kill you. So, like For sure. You just get really excited, get run it, and just Hell, yeah.

Make the shade off of the thing. Yep. No. I don't know if they will you, but Nope. Not close.

Okay. So maybe it doesn't work. I maybe, I don't know. Okay. I guess we're not done being tested yet.

How? Maybe you should say please. I will, yeah. I think I'm gonna go you said all of the things from our visions are essentially here. Right?

The the pillar and the whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Alright. Cool. So I'm gonna go to the, The sword. Yeah. Wherever the sword was.

Was it a pillar? Dias? Hang on. I'm reading this again. It was.

The stone dice. There's that word again. Yep. Yep. Yep.

The base of the pillar. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Do you go to the pillar, and don't get ricocheted off like you did with the river. Just go and let them know. Excellent. You know?

Take a stroll over to the water basin. Alright. Likewise, you are, you walk up to the basin, to no ill effect. Looking into the basin, the the basin itself has a has a mirrored surface. So you aren't able to see, what's underneath the water that that it that it that it has.

And yeah. Well, you walk up to the pillar, hour, and, again, you're not rejected, but, you know, there's the the pillar is, is there in front of you. I'll reach inside the water basin if I can reach inside the water. You do a you do a polar plunge with your no. So you get pulled into the no.

Wait. Wrong wrong, wrong mythos here. You reach into the basin, your hand hits the water, and you feel a slight resistance. But you push a little bit harder, and you're able to break the surface with very little effort. As you do, the water clears.

And at the bottom of it, you see an obsidian mirror with the finest orichalcum, frame that you could ever that you've ever seen. You grab it, I'm assuming. Yes. Pull it out. There.

Yep. So you grab it and you pull it out. And with that, you feel, you feel the the magic in the room. It lessens slightly as you reclaim your mirror. Can you, reach into that pillar there?

Sure. Gonna try. I'll kinda do the same thing, not reach in, but, like, grab as if I'm grabbing a blade and pulling it out. Alright. I'm gonna be my best, Robin Williams as, as Peter Pan, believing with all my might.

You yes. Yes. As your as your hand as your hand approaches the pillar, the the it just starts to crumble away until there's a hilt, that is right in front of you. You grab the hilt and pull out a obsidian bladed sword with or with an wrapped in oraclekhum wire. Excellent.

And, again, Sameer, the magic in the room lessens from that. I would be tempted to say that as we collect these artifacts, the, the smack that you just took seems to be maybe not so, potent. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

That that yep. It's a guess. It's a guess. I wouldn't go jogging for it again just yet, though. Oh, yeah.

Alright. Scott Clark? Yes. Alright. I'm assuming you guys are gonna do similar things.

Yes. Okay. So we'll just go ahead and start with Kahir. You walk up to the, to the brass to the brass, column and, place your hands over the top of it, like, as if you had as you placed the crown down on it. And, the, and the crown, basically, it melted into the into the brass pillar, and now it unmelts into a crown, and you are able to pick it up off of the off of the pillar.

And, Carson, as you step up to the statue of a sitting man who, in your vision, was you, but now you look at it, it doesn't look like you at all. It is a man of some kind, but, we're certain that it was a statue of you. But it doesn't look to be like it doesn't look to be a statue of you in this, in in this room. But the gauntlets are there. And as you pick them up, a gust of wind fills the, fills the room, and the, and the, you know, the scroll drops to the ground.

And, Sameer, the magic is gone other than the magic and the artifacts that you just picked up. Uh-huh. Right. Right. Mhmm.

And with that, it is just about time to call it a night. Oh. So, we will go ahead and call it here Alright. And pick up in pick up in the, Suken Temple in two weeks' time. Woo.

Sick sick. Curious to figure out what these gauntlets do. Yep. Yep. Low energy.

Also curious to figure out who I was in another life. Great. Also curious to see, if we're going to meet any other familiar faces. Oh, boy. Yeah.

I could see that going well. Maybe Or not. Maybe in in a in a elven ranger or, or a human ranger or Yeah. Yeah. Yep.

Or a human paladin or Yeah. I'm only set that I didn't have the four I I didn't have the the forethought to, message Michelle earlier and be like, hey. Do you mind jumping on a call? Oh, yeah. That would've been awesome.

Yeah. That would've been sweet. I know. I just missed opportunities. I was just, like, I mean, I'm not interested.

By the way. It doesn't have to be missed. That is sweet. Yeah. Yeah.

Very cool.
