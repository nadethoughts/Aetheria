Go into so if you go into the hand yeah. Like Jason said, on on the character, little HUD thing down there. Yeah. Click on the the hand. Under there, you'll see survival.

And if you click on if you just click survival, then it will, and it will just do a straight survival rule. If you click on any of the things underneath it, then those will will or those specific activities. How did the clerk roll? It looks to be private, like, his private. Oh, I rolled amazing.

Starting the night strong. Right. Just like standard operating procedure. Clark did do a secret role, which is I don't know why I did unless you did it. Yeah.

I did not force a secret role on this. But, Then why did I go to a secret role? No. It's not lying. It's how.

Oh, I is there two different Oh, okay. There's two different. Carson is sensing his directions. I think terrible as well. Okay.

Are we all checking survival? Good job. We should. Not everybody has made a role, but, for those of you that did, I would tell you that, Karsten I'll do that. You you definitely recognize, you recognize that range.

You don't recognize that place in the range, but you recognize the mountain range. In Cahir, you also recognize that mountain range. And it definitely is, go into the actual map itself. There's yeah. You go go to the map.

If you go to the West, you see a specific mountain range in the West that, How do I get to the map? In the on the landing page, there is a map. Map. Sorry. Click on map.

Usually, it doesn't work for me because it's paused. Okay. Here we go. Okay. So, there's mountain range to the to the west, that has a little bit of a peninsula behind it.

That is that that is that mountain range. You're not quite sure if it's in the Northern Mountain Range or if it's in the Southern Mountain Range, but it definitely looks like it like a patch out of that. Can you put your cursor on it, Chris, so I can see what you're talking about? Over here. Okay.

Over here. So it's basically somewhere sucker. Yeah. Yeah. And it should be noted that on the other side of that mountain range, this peninsula area, this is actually the Elven Kingdom.

Oh. So Elves, elves elven elves exist outside of that kingdom, but that is that's prime that's kind of, like, the primary location of where, of where most of the elves in the world live. Okay. Let's charge in there. There's only one way in and one way out.

Take it. Where where are you? On the map. Scott's looking at the one Scott's looking at the gap. Mountain Pass.

Yeah. Uh-huh. Looking at the gap and thinking that, yo, we can just I mean, 100 hit. Yeah. Gandalf always wants to go around.

I wanna go right through. Yeah. Screw Rohan. Mhmm. Sorry.

An Isengard. No. That's fine. Jerk Saruman hiding out his tower there. Yep.

Alright. Cool. So that was that's kinda that's what you get out of that's what you get out of that. And so with that, I'm gonna go ahead and pull you back into the Goblin Tunnels. Good job, guys.

That was that was very fruitful. Did we kill all the stuff that was around us? Oh, yeah. I think we killed everything in that particular room. Yeah.

We did make it we did make it through that. So go ahead and let me let me see here real quick. Wanna check some stuff. Because I'm not feeling good. Our and here, rule perception checks.

Reception. So basically you see the little, the little mask in, in that, in the box to the left, you click on that. That'll just roll a secret perception check, which will be the very clear blue mask. Yep. The light blue one or the white blue looking thing there.

The dark blue itself, which is the opposite of what we want. Yes. That one. And that is specifically our and Kahir. So Mhmm.

Karsten and Samir, you guys both don't have a high enough perception to get get the check at this point. Oh, that's silly. So that's like that little eyeball? Yeah. The little blue eyeball.

Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Okay. Yeah.

Yeah. Okay. Private. Alright. Good.

So as you're as you guys are just catching your breath and getting getting getting things kinda figured out The spooky music here. You notice that, you notice there's an alcove to the east. And in that alcove, there appears to be, a silhouetted door. It's not it's not an actual door. It just kinda looks like, hey.

That outline in the jacket rocket. Hey. It looks like it could be a door. I, I think there's something over here, guys. Woah.

Go, check it out. Okay. Can we do any healing beforehand? I don't think I'll do it. That's that is a very good question.

That is such a good question. Come here, Carson. I thought you were healed. Why Why do I keep doing stuff, Chris, on accident? I've got, like, effect cover, date cover, and Marshall's Okay.

Aura. Sorry. Well, the Marshall's aura is not is not a you thing. That's a outward thing. That's coming from me.

Alright. So understand. Did you get it? That was fact. Alright.

I'm gonna rev it up again. Okay. And, Clark, go ahead and click on lay on hands healing in the chat, then roll healing. Oh, I'm sorry. That's fine.

Cool. Cool. There you go. Now rev it up and do it again. Just one more should be good.

Alright. 12. Nice. K. Here, are you coming?

Or not here. Sameer. Okay. So Oh, yeah. I guess.

I would like to just take a moment to ask what, what exploration activities people are, performing at this point. So right now, I've got how were you are actively searching. Mhmm. Cahir have you as scouting. I've got Karsten as defending.

Yep. And I've got Samir doing nothing. What? Your I know. Right?

Your, your options are avoiding notice, which is sneaking, covering tracks Mhmm. Defending, detecting magic. I think that's what you were doing before. Yeah. That was the yeah.

Follow the expert, hustle, investigate, repeat a spell, scout, search, track. You wanna continue detecting magic, or do you wanna do something I'll do the magic for now. I don't Okay. I I don't see reason to do the other ones. Okay.

My kids are crazy. Okay. So you guys walk up to the the door. You start, kind of feeling around it, looking for traps and the like. And to your surprise, the door just kind of upon your touch and, you know, your light prodding just kinda opens.

Uh-oh. That's a good sign. I would like to take a step back. Reflexively take a step back. Oh, my shield is raised.

Yes. Your shield is raised because you are defending, so you're still good. Go ahead. No problems there, Clark. The door opens, and you do see some mechanisms that that are in the that are in the, in the jam of the door.

But those mechanisms all seem to be are not sprung. But based off of what you can see, specifically, our, this is this door was meant to be a secret door from the outside in, not the inside out. So it's just a real quick it's just a real quick light push, and you can get out. No problem. But if you were trying to come in from the other side, you would have had to figure out how this mechanism itself worked.

Gotcha. Okay. Alright. So as long as you don't close the door Right. You're good.

But if you close it, you're gonna be, you know, you're gonna be having to try and figure out how to get back out. Okay. I'll kind of take a look at the mechanism for a second. It does it look like it's going to close on its own, or are we going to have to close it? It looks like it will actually try to, try to close after a little bit, But it should be something that you can, like, wedge a stone into and be able to kind of have a little bit of a little bit of a doorstop situation.

Okay. Cool. You are not concerned. Excellent. Excellent.

I'm sure he's just speaking about it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I will do that.

I will get a door rock and, try to jam that thing up from closing. For now Alright. This thing closes on us, we might have a hard time to get back through if we need to quick. So you go through and you find a stone that actually looks like it was kinda designed to be the stopping stone here. Oh.

And plug it in, and you are good to go. Excellent. Alright. Ramsey, can you have our make another perception check? Oh.

Damn. I think that's a good one. Alright. Alright. You again, in this, in this you you walk through the door, you get you get into the into the next room.

And this room is, dark, or it's, rough stone. At the far end of the room, you see the glimmer of a, of an eerie green light, coming coming into the, into the room itself. This room is in pretty it is or would be pretty dark if you guys didn't have your light spell turned on. Right. This definitely looks like the cave that you got like, you know, same sort of cave area that you were recently in before you walked into the the man made section.

K. You do notice as you're taking everything in, you do notice, like, one of the walls to the north about here. Or maybe oh, switch cursor type, out here. Oh, okay. There is, a alcove that appears to be carved into the wall, and it catches your attention.

Okay. I'm gonna go check that out. Okay. I think I see something. I think this is the the the lake we were at before.

I'll just kinda walk past everybody and go check it out. Right. So going into the room, you do see, like, a few layered steps as you go down. So it's like you're you're going you know, it's not like just a direct, crooked 40 degree angle, but you've got a step that you step down into and then another giant step. And when you make it over there, there there's not really a lot of additional, not really a lot of additional paraphernalia around here, other than, like, a few stalactites and stalagmites hanging around, which is kinda why that alcove caught your attention because it appears to be carved out of there.

You start you you start going around there and, like, start pressing around on the top. It's completely empty. There's a little bit of there's no dust on the on the shelf itself. The shelf isn't actually holding anything. You start pressing around on the on the top, and you kinda get, like, a popping mechanism that comes up.

And inside that that mechanism, you see a a scroll that is inside the, that's inside the there's a little bowl. So a piece of shale pops up and then there's a little bowl and inside that bowl is a scroll that is written or that that's rolled up in there. Okay. Excellent. I'll take the scroll and have a look see.

Alright. Great to see you. Well, the I I have I I do I do not believe that I've got an item for it. I was intent on having an item for it, but And then there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. And then the first scroll Yeah.

Seal The, trumpet. So so The white horse. Yeah. So I don't so I don't have an item for it yet, but I will get one into the VTT. But what I do have in here is that, so you see a scroll, you open it up, and you see what's inside of it.

And, quest and it it's let me see what languages you know. It has two different languages in it, and neither of them you recognize. Alright. It is it is written in a, in a sloppy, jerky hand. Okay.

I gotta turn it a little bit. Oh, nope. Gotta pass it behind me. Hey. Wanna read this?

Let me look at it. Here's my email. You take a look at it, and you do not recognize that language at all. Well, I take it back. You do recognize that language.

You've seen that language written a few different times throughout the tunnels themselves, but it's not something that you yourself can read. Not me. Pass it down. Hey. And have a few.

Pick one down, pass it around. Okay. So you you pass it around to everybody. Everybody is trying to take a look at it, and you are for sure you you for sure know that you don't that none of you recognize this language. It's not draconic.

It's not It has a yeah. So the the language that you don't recognize that's in there has a very has a very, a very fell here feel to it. Seems like it's a very dark language. And then the other one that you do recognize, you know, is probably has to do with, something that, was, probably has something to do with, what was, the the creatures that that have been in that been living in this space. It appears to be written by one of them.

Okay. Alright. Maybe someone in the village can help, but for now, talk it away. Right. Nothing Well, nothing magical about it.

Right? Nothing magical. And yeah. I mean, it it basically there's nothing magical about it specifically. I would say that, Carson, you specifically get a little bit more of the heebie jeebies from it than the rest of the group.

But, definitely doesn't have any, well Do I get I'm just let me As as I'm running my detect magic, I'm not picking anything up. This is what I'm saying. Yeah. So no. And that's and that's kinda that's kinda where why I'm starting to walk it back a little bit what I was saying.

So Sameer, your detect magic will tell you that there's definitely some sort of divination magic, surrounding this scroll. The scroll itself is not magical, but it's but it definitely has like like, divination magic has been used around this this scroll. I guess, that's the best way to put it. Okay. And, and Carson, I'm sorry.

What what was the what was the question? I was gonna ask if it's more divine than anything. Yeah. And, yeah, that is that is absolutely true. Like, you you're definitely getting a lot more of a, you know, this is, you know, there's something dark, there's something bad, with to do with this with this scroll.

It's new. It's not a it's not a Raytheli unit. Definitely, definitely got some bad juju. And as you guys get yeah. And and as you guys get through get to the end of the, room, you definitely do look out and you do see that it you're you're back at the you're back at the link where the hag was that you fought.

Well, while we're here, did we this over here up to our north is still black on the map. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do we wanna check that out before, headed back?

Is there any way to it all looks like it's a NASA stone wall. I don't know. Yeah. We can, we can come around. Navigate around the backside of it?

Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Back through the lake again. Okay. I imagine. Yep. Chris, I'll be down.

I was supposed to look out here at the doorway, but, yeah. I'll I'll I'll run that one. Alright. So Chris, I need to be come not encumbered anymore, and I don't know how to do that inventory. Well, I think that the easiest way to do that would be to, max bulk 10.

It'd be to start dropping some stuff here. Yeah. I'm happy to do that. I wasn't thinking that I was encumbered for some reason because I don't know how to tell if you're over, like, how far you're over and all that stuff. If well, let's see here.

Really, the the easiest way to do that is from your character sheet. And if you are, let Yep. Let's actually take a look at the okay. So if you I think that actually if you go to where your character, at that that character hub hug HUD in the, lower right hand corner. If you go to where the backpack is, open the inventory, there there's an option in there that says change carry type, and you can basically, click on the box and then mark some of the things as dropped.

That should that should lower your encumbrance, Like, the leather armors that you have. It's probably the thing that's I'll work on that. Okay. Well, you are having having dropped the I'm good now. Yeah.

Sorry. What was your question, Jason? I'm not seeing what you're talking about there in terms of this backpack. So in the, in the HUD, you in the upper in one of the, one of the tab sections here, we've got, a little sword, a little backpack, a little, a little wand, a little hand. Okay.

So if you click on the backpack, that opens up your inventory. And then in that inventory, there's a little there's something that looks like either, like, a mouse or it's supposed to look like a box. But it's like a square. It's just a square with couple of rectangles on it. That's that will change your carry type.

And if you click on that, you there's a dropped option, and you can and you can just press the dropped option. And it won't remove it from your inventory, but it'll remove it from your bulk. But you don't have access to it because you dropped it. So, I specifically made it so that, you know, I I we've we've been perpetually going through and dropping things here. So, so I basically just been, so I I I I basically just made it so that when things are under the dropped state, they no longer count towards you.

Okay. Okay. So alright. So you guys head over there. And what you see when you walk up is, just a long corridor.

Okay. Let's check it out. Yep. So we proceed. Alright.

Who is anybody tracking? Nobody's tracking. Right? I wasn't this time. No.

I did I did earlier, but I haven't been. Yep. Unless that's search, or is it a separate one? I forgot. No.

It's it's a separate one. So okay. But we do have scouting. So, Scott, why don't you go ahead and roll a perception as you proceed in as you proceed down the down the tunnel? I think I see.

Alright. So so you, definitely you do definitely do notice that there are, samples of goblins throughout this in throughout this, tunnel, but they definitely appear to have left in a hurry. Like, you see a random goblinoid knife that that ended up getting left. You see, you know, paw prints of of a, of a goblin of a goblin dog that that's running off as well. So you don't feel like you're going to be running into any situations where, anything's gonna be lurking around the corners in this, in this tunnel.

And the tunnel just proceeds all the way through to that to that open, to that open space that you were at before. So you might be looking at that. You might be looking at, like, this space here and saying, oh, that's a that's a hard stop. That's not this is actually it goes underneath the corridor that you were. Mhmm.

Yep. Alright. Cool. So this tone just goes straight through. Cool.

Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Alright.

Well, in that case, I believe the only places we have yet to be are down here, to the Southwest, which I believe was outside or it sounded like it was outside. And then this kind of room up in the Northwest, we started to go there and then double backed. So I think let's go check this thing out up to the Northwest. That was good to meet. It's mostly clear.

Chris, if we run into anything, let us know. But I'm just gonna grab and drag and drop myself all the way over there. I will yep. I I will tell you that it is free and clear. So you are good.

Can can we take a quick, a quick bio break? Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Sure.

Alright. Cool. Thanks. I can get snacks and another drink. Another drink.

Mhmm. I mean, just a Mountain Dew. Not a, you know, drink tea. Mountain Dew. Sweet nature of the gods.

It's a little late for Mountain Dew. Oh, it's not? Never. No. Not for me, man.

I don't think it's all affect me anymore, to be honest with you. You're drinking it for the I don't know what. The the pure flavor. Yeah. Yeah.

Basically. The destruction of your teeth. Oh. Basically. I I take it back.

I take that back. And it is Mountain Dew zero, Clark, so it's not a pure nectar. I'm back. I'm alright. I'm back in blank.

Clark, did you buy all that new AI technology? China? What? We're just new China provider of AI technology that's doing it on the cheap. Mhmm.

Mhmm. No. It sounds that bad. They were immediately attacked, though. I don't know if you saw that.

Well, that's what I know. Immediately, they were cyber attacked. Also, don't buy the China company. Buy Nvidia. Buy the dip.

Mhmm. That's what I was thinking today. I was like, this is a perfect opportunity to buy it for $15 cheaper. That's on sale. Oh, I heard, yeah, I heard Nvidia took a hard hit.

Yeah. Mhmm. Who did? Nvidia. Yeah.

Oh, yeah. I've been watching them. I have them on my stock watch. As you should. Like, right now, they've heard that?

Is that what you said? Oh, yeah. Negative $24. Oh. Mhmm.

Oh, did they split? Long time ago. Possibly. Oh, it says 24, and then it says 57. I'm back.

Is everybody else good to go? Or We're good. I got my pork there. Whole car. Your pork rinds, you look great.

Really, all you need is some good pork rinds. I'm trying to figure out how to adjust my my bulk here, but it's not it's not giving me anything, I need to do besides delete stuff. I can delete things. Let's see here. Not sure.

I do see your box in a few places, but Well, that's because you've got a bunch of stuff equipped. Mhmm. Oh, so you you have a bunch of things that are, like, really heavy. I do. Like these elven curved blades, these are like double blade scimitars.

I know they're beautiful. Aren't they? Yeah. You they are. Yeah.

You you did. But they're really heavy. So Oh my god. They're two veneers. They're two each.

Uh-huh. So, basically, what you're gonna need to do for or anything that's got a shirt on it, you just click on the shirt and then grab and then click on the dropped option in there. So the box or the shirt, either way. Okay? Alright.

Alright. Cool. Cool. Cool. So you get back over to that corridor and start start going down it, and it is, there's some stair steps that go down to a, a stone well, not a stone, but a thick wooden door at the bottom of the stairs.

Check it, Carson. So Carson, or not car Kahir, you were scouting. So, go ahead and roll a perception down there. Am I too close to the door? No.

You're fine. I don't wanna die. My mouth is broken. Oh, no. Why is this always I got a lot of privacy going on here.

Privacy issues. It like, anytime you like, if you're using the little eyeball for your perception checks, it does it does secret roles for me. So I see everything. So it's it's perfectly fine. So on the on the other side of the door, you hear, how would I describe this?

Mhmm. There are you hear a lot of squirming in the in the door. Like a damsel in distress squirming or like a No. Tortured? Your your character probably has gone fishing and that kind of thing.

More like, you know, there you you have a bundle of worms, and they're just kinda, like Swishing around. Crawling over each other. Yeah. Swishing around and crawling over each other and that kind of thing. Do you like snakes and such?

Oh, yeah. I don't like snakes. There mhmm. Your character is fine now. Yeah.

Right. Yeah. So that's what you hear on the other side of the door. You do check the door. It doesn't appear to be locked, and there doesn't appear to be any, any traps or anything on there.

But there's definitely mean, a monster door that could bite your heads off? If it was a monster door that was gonna bite your head off, it would have already done it by now. Nice. Good point. Carson, I knew I nudged Carson like, dude, open the door.

I would say something chicken shit, and then I'd open the door. Okay. This is one of those opportunities. I don't know if you guys do have any, like, prep stuff that you can do. I would give you a round of prep if you are before you open the store if you want to.

If you don't need it, then no big deal. But My shield's raised. I'm prepped. For me. Right.

The only thing I've got, requires me to, like, you know, be relatively loud. So Fair enough. I'm a pass. Okay. But it's only one action anyway.

So Right. Right. If you don't have anything, that's perfectly fine. You guys are relatively low level. So it's I do have something.

I'm gonna take one of my arrows, and I'm gonna dip my arrow with that lethargy poison I found earlier. Oh, okay. Lethargy poison. Use, What did that do? Uses lethargy poison.

Oh, okay. Cool. Alright. Sick. I guess I just used the thing and it's on my arrow now.

There's it's not in game though. So I figured out if I if wanna use it. Yep. Alright. Cool.

Okay. Well, here we go then. You open the door, and what is greeting and what greets you in the room beyond? You see I see that. I I know.

I know. I'm I'm getting there. You see a, some bloody marks on the side of the wall of, you know, of some weird handwriting. But in the middle of the room, you actually see a giant mass of leeches. Oh.

One might even call it a swarm of brood leeches. Yeah. Let's roll let's roll some initiative, shall we? Yeah. Wow.

Oh. We just shut the door and go back the other way. I thought you again. If you so desire, you can shut the door and walk the other way. I rolled pretty high that time.

Where's the initiative again? Where's the door? No doubt. Well, it's either on the, either on the, the carousel or in the, the contact carousel. There's a little die on on your character there.

Or if you go to the close right here. You know, we can do some good rolling now. I'm stupid. I'm sorry. Oh, you're not stupid.

So the comic carousel at the top, can can you see that? Mhmm. Oh, it's right on my character. Right? There it is.

That's where I was just See, you're not stupid. That's a good initiative. Oh, yeah. That's fantastic. Regardless, I think you should go last.

I don't even mean going last. Right. Let's begin, shall we? And Cahir, I guess, closes the door and walks the other way. Is that that way you guys decided?

I don't even know really that long. I'm sorry. What's the scenario here? Why is it so large? She like it takes up four squares.

It what what you're dealing with right now is not a single enemy. It is what it it is a swarm. So it's basically this congealing mass of leeches that are just hanging out in the center. They are each other's warmth. Right.

In the rest of the in the rest of the room, you have a few you've got a few tables over here, one here, a couple over here, a stool over here. You have some bloody writing on the wall, but the rest of the room is pretty empty. And then just in the center of the room, you have this large broiling mass of leeches. I mean, I'd like to go swing at it, but I'm scared. Oh.

Mhmm. Mhmm. I don't like these leathery things. Should I make my turn after Carson's? You can if you if you want to.

I just wonder what it'll react if I hit it. You know, it'll take me and kill me. You you honestly don't know what its abilities are, but you've never seen a you've never seen a creature that has immediate, like, reaction if you attack it. And, there are some spells in the game and some abilities that do, do, like, retaliatory things. But, this is not like, I I wouldn't worry about it at this level.

Alright. Let's go up here. I would like Chris to address a couple of things. Yes. First, how do I do my wild magic thing?

Okay. You do need to do your wild magic thing. There it is. So your wild surge or your wellspring surge, I think is what you call. That's what they call.

Yeah. So go ahead and roll, d four. And if it's a one or two, it's a level one spell. If it's two or three, it's level two spell or a three or four, it's level two spell. So one and two.

So level one spell. Yes? Yep. So you get a level one spell for the next two, for the next, I think, three turns to spend. I think it's just weird.

Alright. This guy, here runs up to the, to the massive leeches, and what's he gonna do? He's gonna try to tighten swing as soon as he remembers how to turn that on. Alright. Enraged.

The easiest thing to do with that is where you see the little sword is, like the little action thing. Yep. You go and check the checkbox, then swing with your axe. K. Big money and big money.

Oops. Got a target first. Oh, man. How come you hit so hard? Okay.

You hit it with you you take a mighty swing with your with your axe. Go ahead and roll damage. The Titan swing on, so it should roll too. Right? Oh.

Big sauce. For 22 points of damage. Oh, it's pretty good. I'll die. Oh, he didn't take it all, though.

Yeah. So it apparently has some resistances. So you swing in and, like, take and basically chop a a good chunk of the leeches in half in one swing, and then the and then the mass just kinda congeals back together and just starts attacking or just continuing to do its thing. I'm feeling that it's attacking. I'm done.

It is attacking. Yes. Yes. It is. Wish me luck, boy, as I turn around.

This thing's bigger than I've it looks 15 feet away. It was a good move. It was a good move. It did the right thing. Did it move back five feet, or is that just doesn't even matter?

Just something that big. It didn't move at all, buddy. It didn't move at all, but it is going to move. Oh. It says the Titan swing target is pushed back five feet.

Oh, okay. Well, I guess it got pushed back five feet, and then Then it moves. It moves over you. Woah. And it is going to perform its blood draining bites, and it'll do twice.

That is not encouraging. No. Did I just say that out loud? You did. Go away.

See here. Just making sure. Yeah. So it doesn't have an attack. What it has is blood draining bites.

So any enemy in this warm in this warm space takes two d six bleed and is exposed to brood leech swarm venom. Oh. So it's going to target and target, Cahir. It's going to initiate the bleed. You might die, buddy.

Goodbye. Very encouraging. Now it's going to yes. There we go. So now Cahir has a bleed, has a bleed damage.

Oh, okay. And that's all it's going to do. That's all. Sameer, you're up. I was thinking about this.

Lovely, you know, whatever this is. Attack with fire. Yeah. Do it. Do you want to?

Maybe I ought not to. Why? It's it's my last level two spell. Well So it looks like, the leak here is surrounding me, killing me slowly. Yeah.

She's just killing me killing you gently. That's all. Yeah. So I think I'll we'll do a little we'll do a little lightning. Do a little lightning.

K. Because they gotta they gotta do this. That'd be Reflex save. From the thunder strike. Nice.

Alright. He fails or they fail. Yay. Oh, is it damage? I think it's supposed to be sonic damage, right, on that?

Looks like electricity and sonic. Yeah. And they'll do it automatically. You don't have to change any of the damage types. It just was throwing acid in there.

So It it's not damage on it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

The the you don't have the you don't have the always in the damage dialogue, there's this additional damage option that you can turn on, and it always starts it off as acid. If you don't have that turned on, it's not gonna do any acid damage. Gotcha. Okay. No worries about that.

That's that's pretty good roll there with that three or the 10 and the three is good for the four. That's not bad. Alright. So failure takes full damage. Okay.

Unfortunately, they are not wearing metal, so they're not clumsy, but they do still take the full damage that you dish out. That's where you want some damage. That's pretty fantastic. Yeah. It's not bad from a from a b 12 and a b four.

That's that's pretty good. That's fantastic. Yeah. I mean, it's not it's not gonna compare to Cahir. I mean, let's be realistic.

Oh, nobody really compares to Cahir. You're also not getting the blood sucked out of you at the moment, So you're doing far. Alright? That's true. Alright.

Al, where are you? We're up. Well, this thing is not doing well. So we're gonna forego the labor of making my thing lingering. We're just gonna use greatest anthem.

I'm a try this new macro. Yay. It did the thing. Sick. Alright.

Cool. So everyone has greatest anthem. You don't have to drag or do anything anymore because Chris is awesome and made a macro for me. Yay. I I I did not make the macro.

I just found the macro. Oh, but Either way That's amazing. And then I'm going to cast some electric arc at it. Right. Let's roll some reflex save here.

It did succeed. Alright. Yeah. It did. It takes three.

Alright. That's me. That's all three. Right. Oh, fuck it up, Tarsten.

Is it my turn? Yep. And I move five feet. Alright. And I swing.

How do I double swing? Double swing. And how does that work? Like, attack twice? Or No.

Two handed swing. Oh, well, you just drop your drop your, shield and change grip. Yeah. Can he tighten swing with ones with one hand? Oh, yeah.

He can totally tighten swing with one hand. Oh, okay. You wanna do that? Yeah. I wanna do that.

Okay. Please. But I don't know how to make sure it's a Titan swing. So I'll, so where the where the little sword actions thing is from the hut, if you look up at the top, there's a Titan swing checkbox. Just check it.

Oh, champions or oh, okay. Alright. Okay. I did that and now just hit Now just yeah. Just attack it with your, with Winter's Gone.

There we go. Okay. That's a two action attack. So Oh my goodness. That's that seems pretty good.

That's a wait. How about how is it about the action? Oh, it cost me two actions for that? Yeah. Yeah.

Titan swing cost an extra action. But Oh, okay. I forgot. Two dice, though. So when you critical hit, it's good.

Yeah. I did just critical. Right? So go ahead and roll damage. Right.

Alright. Hey. I'll take that. Holy cow. That's not usually what I get, but I'll take it.

You did fantastic. That's pretty fantastic. That is pretty fantastic. That that's starting to, you know, compete with what's going on. K.

Here. What you gotta do? Tighten something. Alright. So, Clark, how how does, how does Karsten destroy the, destroy the the leeches?

I would I would scream, get off my frat coat here. And I would kinda do, like, a I don't know. I would just try to I don't know if I can go, like, in between them and just kinda start whacking them or get a whole bunch of them with one big swing or the ones that are near them. You can do whatever you want there. So That's what I would do.

I would just kinda dive. Your special moment. Also something with Titan swings. Titan swings are, like, basically, there's a supernatural, like, power that enters you that causes that additional that additional dive damage. So, when you when you attack with the Titan Swing, you can come up with any special, like, you know, sun based flare of how it looks when you do it.

So Okay. Feel free. Okay. Feel free to to do whatever you want there to make your Titan swing as awesome as possible. Alright.

And so what's that? Well, you are, you are no longer You were bleeding. You were bleeding, but the moment that the leech has disappeared, they stopped sucking your blood. So you are no you are not bleeding. So That was if it would've come back to my turn, then I could've rolled on that thing?

Okay. I didn't mean to roll it. Oh, no. It's fine. I don't think you actually ended up taking any damage for it, did you?

Oh, you did. Well, undo that. There you go. It's just Back back to where you were. Alright.

So rose. Yeah. Yeah. Gotta kick the pile of leeches a little bit. They kinda jiggle as they skid across the room.

I don't know. Yeah. Just think of gummy worms. Yeah. It's kinda it's kinda like the, it's kinda like the the red and blue ones.

Sour gummies. Yeah. Really slimy and black. Slimy. That's satisfying.

Right. Yeah. Great stuff. So as everything just kind of dissipates and and and you kick the kick the leeches across the room, you see on the wall, there is, there's a message that's written. Kinda language a lot of us know?

No language. None of you know. Excellent. Yay. I'll take some time to, like, transcribe it.

Alright. Even though I can't read it, I can still, you know, copy it. That seems great. Alright. So you take a minute and and transcribe the runes as best you can, and there is yet one more door.

Uh-oh. I have my notes. This is Okay. One more door. This door, you don't need to listen at it.

You you hear, you heal hear a militant voice directing troops or directing directing troops, I guess. And do you also hear and it's a loud, rough, gruff voice, and then you hear something that sounds a little bit softer, issuing instructions, and then the loud the loud, gruff voice, you know, shouting out the shouting out the shouting out additional instructions. You can't really make out exactly what they're saying, but it's but the the gist of it is we're under attack. Be ready. There's some there's somebody on the other side of the door.

Oh, actually. The door itself is indeed locked. This one is. Like, we should knock. That's polite.

Right. I can try to pick it open or, Kihir, you can, knock real hard. Thinking we could put, like, an x through it. That's a good way to knock, like Yeah. Yeah.

You'd rather kick it down. Yep. This is just a wood door. Right? We're not, like, stone or metal or okay.

Exactly. Yeah. Go for it. Alright. But this time I am, because this is a thing I could do.

I will ready an action because I can use a one action thing with a ready action. And I'm gonna ready my courageous anthem or when the door opens. Okay. Because that is a prep thing I can do. I will not make noise until the action starts.

That sounds good to me. So I'm going to, request a role from UK here. That'd be fantastic because if we had to back another way into this chamber Yeah. That would be fantastic. Where there is one.

There may be. There could be. Given the layout of this map. But Yeah. It's really hard.

Either way, they're expecting us. Yeah. It'd just be fun to have one person pounding on the door while everybody else storms in on that side of them. Yes. Yes.

Yes. Indeed. Tell me what you need me to do. I am just Of course. I just submitted a request for an athletics check from Cahir.

You should see something in the chat that that is requesting a d c 17 athletics rule to break down the door. Oh, no. You should be able to do that. No problem. We should.

See d c 17, but let's just do it now. Oh. Alright. Wow. Do you hammer through the door?

That is bigger than 17 for sure. So you break down the door and you see four goblin warriors, a large bugbear, and a grotesque, and a grotesque, let me see if I can pull it up here. And a grotesque old woman. Oh. Yeah.

With a huge humpback. Is a grotesque. Mhmm. That's gotta be really Who they all appear to be deferring to. I, okay.

Feel bad for her. She's gotta be in a lot of pain. Probably. Not as much as she's about to leave. Alright.

So let's go ahead and roll some, roll some initiative, shall we? And Scott, I will go ahead and let you use your athletics check as your initiative for this. Yeah. So you don't have to roll your initiative. I'm just gonna use that instead.

Woah. Oh, wow. Wow. Wow. Wowie zowie.

That's fantastic. But if I don't wanna go first Oh, don't worry about that. You're not. It doesn't look like you are. You know?

That's pretty great. That's a turn where we're set up right that time. It's awesome. I don't think I did that. No.

I did. I'm I'm setting your I'm setting your guy up. You thought right. 27 athletics. So this is a this is a prime example of using a different skill for initiative.

Because Cahir used his athletics to start combat, he gets to use his his athletics as his initiative check. If you're doing something if you are actively doing something when combat breaks out, you get the opportunity to use that skill rather than using perception for initiatives if that skill check, rather than using perception for initiative in those sorts of areas. So that's why he was able to use his athletics because he basically created the combat using his athletics. Okay. Alright.

So I think we got Perfect. To enroll. Yeah. Yeah. We're still waiting on that.

Oh, sorry. I'll just go ahead and roll NPCs while he's doing his thing. Y'all roll pretty good. I already did. Yeah.

I rolled very well. Alright. Holy old heck. Okay. So, let's go ahead and Yeah.

Most of them better than me. Alright. Let's get started here. So, Alwar, you are up. Yep.

Yep. Yep. Yep. Alright. Let's see here.

We've got that goblin, that goblin, that goblin. Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool.

Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. First things first, I'm gonna do the, ready, create this anthem thing.

Let's try this new other macro out. We do have a plus one expert and a roll. Bam. It was a success. Composition last three rounds.

Did that apply? Yep. It looks like it applied. Yes. Sweet.

That is sick. That is so good. Okay. Alright. Cool.

Yeah. Now, I will take my three actions, and my first, fall within 30 feet. Boo hiss. So I can't do okay. I can't do all the things, which makes me sad, but I can do some of them.

I will let's see here. Yeah. You know what? That seems pretty freaking good. We're gonna cast my first second level spell.

Stand back. We've never done this before. Uh-oh. We're gonna cast calm. This is a 10 foot burst.

Oh, I see this does not function, but it's not the 10 foot I was expecting. Oh, that's a little sad. Burst is centered on you, isn't it? No. No.

No. It's not. But it's, it's it's just different than I expected, which is okay. No. Okay.

We will yeah. We're still gonna try it here because this is my best bet. So I'm gonna place it here so it's gonna affect the woman in the Haba Goblin. Mhmm. K.

And they need to make a wheel saving throw. Oh. It does create a way to see. Yeah. That seems pretty good.

Alright. Cool. Enough happens. That's the perfect waste of your second level spell. That happens.

That happens. For my third action, I'm going to use my short bow and, shoot at this little, goblin here, with a not poisoned arrow, notably. Okay. Actions. I've not used the new action thing to strike with yet.

Strike roll. Oh, I hit him. That's a hit. He fell down. Alright.

Roll the damages. Oh my god. Mhmm. Four four damages. Alright.

He takes a he takes a, an arrow in the shoulder, staggers back a little bit, composes himself, and gets ready for his next action. Alright. Now that's me. Right. Right here.

I always do this. I might as well keep doing it. Yeah. Just run out there and do something. Okay, man.

When when all you got is a when every all you got is a hammer, every problem is a nail. I start small, work my way up. Mhmm. Yep. Yep.

Fair enough. Focus on everything. Doing regular stuff here. Boo. They'll hit the They're they're just little goblins, man.

Yeah. No. That's unfortunate for them. It is. It is quite unfortunate for them.

Yeah. It is. Oh. Okay. You cleave one in Twain.

I'm assuming you're getting the other one. Yep. Do I use my second strike, map minus five? Yep. K.

Oh. Big money? Yeah. Yeah. Still hits.

Oh. Big money? Mhmm. Alright. Excellent.

So Cahir runs in, cleaves two goblins in two. Yep. Right now. Looks around and says, what's everybody else doing? Right.

Right. We're waiting for the old hag to respond. Well, she's gonna do that. Oh, yes. She's gonna do that.

K. She's going to go and say hello to our new little friend. She's going to strike out with strike out at you with a claw. It's the claw. Lock it with your back.

This is who will say it who will go. And she digs into your flesh doing seven doing 13 points of damage. Oh. And then she's going to, then she's going to use her b train touch. Oh.

Never mind. That requires you to not think she's an enemy, and you would probably do things. Right now. Wait a minute. Wait a minute here.

I may have completely misplayed this this bad guy, but that's okay. She's going to attack again. Mhmm. Mhmm. Because the other thing that she tried to do, she couldn't do.

And she's going to miss. But I would request that you, Scott, I am going to need you to, make a fortitude save. Okay. Claws must have something in them. Mhmm.

They do indeed. Big money. You do succeed. So you are in you are in the clear. So nothing bad happens other than getting mauled by, witch's nails.

The guy who was attacked by Alwar is gonna circle back around to do some a little bit of back tactics. He's not gonna attack Alwar, is he? No. He's going to attack Cahir. Oh.

He's going to be an opportunist like they have a tendency to be. Mhmm. They do. And he jabs him jabs him in the in the lower back doing five points of damage to him, and then he is going to, then he's going to retreat away. Run away.

Run away. He he saw what happened to his body. Right. That is it's not somebody you patty cake with. Then his friend takes a five foot step forward.

Mhmm. And then it's his turn. And he's going to do the same thing. Pack. This time, it's going this one is going to miss.

Then he's going to run back this way. But he cannot be focused on by ranged combatants. He's a little bit smarter than the rest of them. This guy is familiar. He'll move up.

Really, you're the best you're you're the best target, man. I'm sorry. No. I'm the only one in the room. I know.

I'm the only one who's had had a turn. Well, I guess Right. Alwar did, but I wasn't moving up there. Oh, I like that idea, Not so much. Right.

He's going to twin feint, which will put you off guard. He's going to attack with both of his daggers and miss with both of them even though you're off guard. Wow. Good job. Very sad.

That's impressive. And he's stuck at that point. He was really hoping for some for some awesome awesome half orc steak on his table, but It's not looking so good. That's not that's not going to be around. We got Sameer.

You were up. Sameer, come on in, brother. It seems like I probably ought to. Test out those hit points. Right?

Yeah. See how how many true. You did get four more. I know. Yeah.

We got decent amount. Yeah. Yeah. Did you actually put on that belt? I I I see where No.

You didn't put on the belt with good health. Oh, yeah? Yeah. You're One of the 13 things that I I forgot to put. Oh, yeah.

There you go. Yeah. I see it. If you want to put it on, I will allow it. Oh, oh, okay.

Oh, I okay. I I have it on warned, but it's must be it's a different warn setting I need to have it on. So Down worn belts. Now now you've got it. Yeah.

So anyway You got 40 hit points. Oh, that's, like, massive. Sure. Yeah. I see why I couldn't jump right here beside Cahir, get myself killed.

I'll see why you couldn't either. Yeah. Let's try let's try that. Blazing bolt. Yeah.

It's a little bit of a crazy one because it sounds Is that a two or a one? Action. I was thinking of two because it sounds like if I hit the one, then I could target the other. Is that true? Different two action.

A diff an additional rate, a different target. Yep. Right. So do I need to target both of them right now? Yeah.

And all you need to do to do that is hover over them and press t. And I think that you might need to shift. But Yep. Okay. I did it.

Here you go. Sweet. So blaze the bolt and then hit the attack. Right? Yep.

Or yeah. Hit the attack. Raise the attack. I was going for the hacky chick late at first, but I don't know if it will do that or what. I don't know how it does it anyway.

Okay. So you hit. Yeah. Now I roll damage or do I pull damage. Yeah.

Okay. Figure out which one you hit, but Yeah. I don't know. That's not bad. 15 points of damage is pretty good.

Yeah. Bugbear. Okay. Oh. You can play it to both of them.

That's interesting. It's no. That was me. I I did that. The hag actually, you the hag, you actually did miss.

Mhmm. But you did but you did for sure hit the hit the bugbear. Mhmm. So Okay. So it shot at both of them.

I missed the hag, hit the other one. And that would be all of my actions. That was a move and two attacks. Right. And there we are down to Karsten.

Hey. I'm gonna move right here. And Oh, yeah. Clark, just remember, I I just wanna check and make sure. Are you gonna be tightened swinging this time or, because if you're not, you just need to uncheck.

You are. Okay. Do it. Makes sense. Is he in a spot where he gets that additional bonus for tactical stuff or does he need to step down one more to get that?

He does. Yeah. Yeah. I was like, I hope so. He's good.

Okay. He's good because he's catty corner from to here. So Mhmm. Mhmm. Okay.

That's a hit. Uh-huh. That's a hit, boys. Uh-huh. Oh.

Big money. Sixes. That's 72 points of damage. Yeah. Uh-huh.

That's nothing to scoff at. He's not feeling good. Again, you have that again, you have that majestic corona effect, whatever it is, and you your, and your sword just, you know, slices through and maybe a ray of sun or something erupts. That's what I I it's really bad. Is, basically, like, the strength of the sun or light or fire.

Yeah. Kinda gets wielded as it lights through. Awesome. Alright. So you slice in and, like, a seed of the sun gets implanted in the wound and that explodes after you after your slice, which causes a big corona explosion of of light and causes extra damage.

Very pretty. Or something like that. And we are back to Alwar. Alrighty. Alwar will.

That guy's nearly dead. She did really well on her save. Yeah. You should take her out. Got a couple of guys not serious.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. I don't know what I'm thinking. I have to move up a little, which is fine. Yeah. I just don't think that's gonna work on her.

So we're gonna move up a bit. Perfect. And we're gonna target these two guys with all reliable electric arc. Oh. Oh, it's a good roll.

That's a beautiful roll. Let's see how they save. Hopefully, they don't. Oh, the big guy succeeded. That's alright.

Just barely. Alright. So off the goblet, we'll take it. One down. One three down.

Alright. That's me. That's all my actions. You still took damage though. Right?

Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yep. He took six. He is at death's door.

He's real close. Oh. Yeah. And, Kahir, speaking of at death's door, you're up. Not saying you are at death's door.

I'm saying that you are going to bring somebody to death's door, just to clarify. Let's just switch one first. I know. Start with the hag first. She seems I don't know.

Seems like she's got a little bit better, capacity to resist, being hit. Yeah. Yeah. We have lots and lots of hero points, Jason. Ah.

It's hero points. That's your point. Oh. Big Titan swing. Oh.

We needed one more. It'd be critical. Should we reroll it to try to get critical? No. Alright.

You swing into the large humpbacked lady. The Titan swing. Oh, wow. He man. Wow.

What does He man do? He, like, sticks his sword up, and it becomes light, and then By the power of Grayskull. Alright. So you you swing your axe into her. It lodges itself in her hump, and you have to kind of forcefully yank it out, but you're able to get it out of get it out of the, of the what appears to be some sort of maybe, bat deposits or something.

Jiggles a little bit as you pull it out. Who is this a little bit? Jiggles. Jiggles. Oh, jiggles.

So she's This is and you do have one action left. Yeah. Yep. She's gonna go next. She is.

Big money. Oh, all that. Alright. That is a hit. Better.

Big money. Oh. Couldn't do it, boys. Excellent. Oh, that's alright.

Okay. She go okay. She is going to use exhaling exhaling miasma. Oh, that's bad. Mhmm.

She's going to So I'm like her crush. Yeah. She basically just just breathes out really heavy and some noxious, some noxious fumes come out. So what I need is I need both bugbear. Yeah.

Sameer and, Kahir to make, giggling humors. No. It doesn't say on there what the save should be. No. I've I've got it.

I need you both to roll a fortune save. I've got it on there now. Oh, okay. Oh, it's 20. Nice job.

Back to normal. Alright. So Not true. Cahir, you did indeed save. Thinking I should probably use a hero point.

You can choose to use a hero point if you so desire. I've got a few, it looks like. How do I do that? If you, that's a good question. I would say just spend one of your hero points and then roll a fortitude save again, because there's not really a good way to do it from this specific, role request.

K. Or yeah. I I would say, just spend one of your hero points and then there's a little re Reroll button. That little recycle button. Yeah.

Just click the reroll button after. And then if you roll under a 10, then we'll add 10 to it. Little bit of mental math. Okay. So when I click on that reroll button, it gives me a reroll using hero point.

So Oh, awesome. Use that. I'm going to click on that button and hit the reroll button and see what does it do. Same thing. Oh my gosh.

Gosh. That is ass nine. You did You you did actually roll better though. Oh, yeah. Because you used to hear a point.

You still failed, but you did. But because you used the reroll, you rolled a three and then it added 10 to it. So it was a 13 plus whatever your four days. Mhmm. Which still wasn't good enough to hit that d c 20 fortitude safe.

So Right. Right. Unfortunately, you weren't able to you weren't able to get that. So you are rewarded with your effort with by being enfeebled one for the next day. Oh.

Serious. And then the hag is going to is gonna target, Cahir and claw him. Come on, Cahir. Oh. Oh, wow.

And hit him solidly Oh, out. For 26 damage. Woah. You you were off guard and clumsy. It was a critical hit.

And I'm gonna need you to make another fortitude save, please. Oh my gosh. Nice. Which from which you will pass. So because because you're a barbarian.

Barbarian's barbarian. Alright. But next up is I'm feeling good. Next up is this goblin that's been hiding in the corner. He's going to take his opportunity.

Oh. And he's gonna try and he's gonna try and finish Pekiro off. I'm not flanked there, am I? You are not, which is good because he misses you. Left.

And then he's going to run towards what looks to be an arrow slit. Oh, maybe it's good we didn't try to go the other way. Yep. Alright. It's the bugbear's turn.

That's what he's doing. Yeah. Hitting Sameer. Why not? Hey.

That's that's not what he's gonna be doing. He's gonna be double striking now. Close here. Strike. I mean, Send me to my grave.

Get hurt. Car Carson. Carson. I believe you have a reaction. Yay.

I do. Or or will. You will. Yeah. I believe you have a reaction.

Right? Yes. We take damage first. But yes. I'm dead then.

You are dead. Why are you dead? Well Oh, you're dead. You're not quite dead. Choose target.

Do I do it now? It says choose target. This is kinda cool. It says you're dead. Again.

The moon died. That is what it says, but it's not entirely accurate. Right. It's mostly dead. Alright.

It is felt accurate. So two things to the chest. So Clark, you do have this reactive strike. Are you going to choose to take it? Yes.

But I don't know where it is in my. If you scroll up, if you scroll up on the chat window, there's a little system message in there that says Carson may use retributive strike. Right. Re so just click on the yes. Choose target.

K. I did. Alright. And what's it tell you from there? It didn't tell me anything.

It went down to here. Okay. Or it says Is there any dialogue or anything that pops up? No. Okay.

Yeah. I'm not sure. I haven't really seen how that works on your side. So, but regardless I mean, I saw I saw it in chat Right. But it didn't I don't know where where what else it did.

Okay. So really all that you need to do, let me go ahead and I just click on them? So we'll throw ahead we'll go ahead and throw the repute of strike up here. Right. So I need to what you do is you target the the guy who triggered it.

So you'll try target the bug bear. Yeah. The ally gains resistance to damage against the triggering damage equal to two plus your level. If the enemy is within reach, make a melee strike against it. So your Retribution of Strike does two things.

One, you anybody within your the the person the target of the attack within the aura gets resistance equal to five for the attacks that you that you do the review to strike on. So we'll have to go back and make sure that here, that here takes the appropriate damage. He didn't take 12 damage twice. He took seven damage twice. Oh, I see.

Reading that. And you get to attack the bugbear. With my normal strike? Yes. Can I use a Titan swing?

Well, just a regular swing? You would just it's just like a it's just like an attack of opportunity. So you don't get use any special moves. It's just a strike. Okay.

So no Titan Swing, but still, you know, it's it's damage. So whoo. Looks like a hit. Hey. Not bad.

Pretty good. Nice. It's the best I can do. It's enough. Alright.

So let's do some let's do some let's do some retro stuff here. We're gonna undo the damage that Cahir took. Here, Cahir has okay. So here is at death's Door. Excellent.

It's got 11 hit points. 11 hit points minus twelve and ten with resistance five for each. That's what? 12? 12.

So he's still Hell yeah. So you so you still drop, but you drop by but you almost stayed. Oh, that's good because the other guy died. Right. But this is like, just just wanna point out that, wanna point out a couple of things here.

This is the same thing with, like, lay on hands. Lay on hands not only gives you additional hit points, but if you use it in combat, you get an AC bonus of plus two for a round. Also, retributive strike, again, you get, with with retributive strike, you get, you get damage resistance as you know, so if somebody's within your champions aura, which is like a 15 foot aura around you, like and somebody else attacks somebody who's, like, one one of your protected people or one of your party members, that and they're within that aura, you can just throw, you you can just throw, damage resistance to them. And if you're within striking distance, you can attack the person that that did the damage to. So these are you know, not only are they helpful in that they're healing you and that they're and that they're attacking bad guys, but also they're causing damage resistance and they're giving you AC bonuses and that kind of stuff.

So don't sleep on those guys. Those are, like, those things are really, really powerful. So that's one of the reasons why it's awesome to have it's awesome to have the champion out front, like, in in the mix because not only is he, like, taking potentially taking hits, but he's also, like, you know, granting, ready, you get a you you get damage resistance. Here, have some extra AC. Here, Here, I'm gonna heal you.

Here, I'm gonna do this. You know, it's just really, really awesome. So, just wanted to gush a little bit about your character class, Clark, because it is really freaking awesome. So For sure. Thank you.

Yeah. No problem. Just just in case you are feeling inadequate to the barbarian who can only do damage. Like Yeah. I was just you could do so much more.

Yeah. You could do so much more than just do damage. Right? So Right. Alright.

Cool. So, Sameer, you are up. Mhmm. No. That's unfortunate.

Oh. Says Says you're perfectly fine in all this. It it says that. It's a lie, but it says that. So Samir tried to be a target, and then it just failed miserably.

Blurry of I don't need it to be a reach spell. Going for the heck with that? Or Yeah. I got her pinged. She's pinged.

Okay. You got her laser? Yeah. So I was trying to see it says that it targets two creatures Mhmm. But I like, there's there's not two creatures here.

Can I take both attacks on the same creature? Just striking claws appears slash at two nearby foes making spells attack roll against each creature. That's its two attacks over it doesn't really like it. Healthy doesn't increase. No.

So it it's base it should really read it attacks up to two creatures within. Although, if you position yourself in in the right spot, you might be able to get both the goblin and the hag. The goblin's only 25 feet away from you. Yeah. It's just, Or 30 feet away from you.

But it says 10 feet from each other. So that was the thing. Two creatures no more than 10 feet away from you. Oh, yeah. You're right.

You're right. There was a way for you to move the goblin a little bit closer to the hag, then you'd be great. I know. Right? Push it up.

Yeah. I wonder. I like okay. So, Jason, I would I would rule it this way unless I see something that says differently. But hear me out here.

Reach spell. Mhmm. Next action you use is to cast a spell that that has a range increase the spell's range by 30 feet. As a standard increase, the spell ranges, if the spells if the if the spell normally has a range of touch, you extend the range to 30 feet. I would like, it's it's not exactly.

Yeah. I see what you're saying. Stay, like, you know, maybe instead of 10 feet away from each other, 20 feet away from each other is okay, you know, or 25 feet away from each other is okay. Yes. We're thinking Like, I'd I'd allow it.

I mean, it's it's probably a bit of a stretch on this, but Mhmm. If in this circumstance, I would totally, like, not work this way all the time, but I think that they allow it to work this way. Fair. Alrighty. We'll give it a go.

Alright. So I clicked on the goblin also. So I will roll my attack. I will roll a heck of a lot better than my beautiful three. It's good enough to hit both.

Good. That's fantastic. Damage. Oh, nice damage too. Oh.

Wow. 20. Did also Wow. Nice. Wow.

That is a vicious little spell. It is an amazing spell. Yeah. You also use blood magic, so we'll go ahead and add the blood magic thing to you. So Is that something I need to do when I'm doing that?

Yeah. So there's this effect draconic blood magic. Just drag it and pull it onto your thing. I I went ahead and did it Okay. This time.

But Okay. Effectively, what it does is every time you use one of your draconic heritage spells Mhmm. You get a plus one AC. Oh. So it probably isn't gonna matter in this one.

But But, yeah, it's nice. Point point You never know? The toxic damage is pretty nice, though. Yeah. Yeah.

Alright. So you so two what what are they? Ghostly draconic claws? Or It doesn't really specify, but yeah. Two two sets of claws just materialize, more or less and just rake.

Yeah. Just rake the creature right in there, whatever. So the goblin that was running away, just like two two sets of claws just come across and just, you know, just right from his head to his toes straight across the bottom. The hag is facing me, so that one probably caught her in the face. Alright.

She is actually still alive. Mhmm. She's a very strong lady. But she is a very strong lady. It's she's she is the boss monster here.

So she gotta be a little bit tough. But you you completely decimated that extra goblin. Perfect. Alright. Thanks.

And, Karsten, you are up. Yay. I'm going to walk. I'm gonna whacker with a Titan swing. You do have hero points?

Oh, yeah. I'm using a hero point. Where are they located? Is this a hero point? Nope.

If you if you you don't have to worry about moving them. Just if you right click on the strike that they missed. Yep. Yes. Oh.

That was better. Maybe. That is a good hit. So roll damage. Nice.

That's not bad. No. That's not bad at all. It's pretty solid. Should do it.

Should do it. Nice. Look at that. Woo hoo. How do you want to have killed the hag?

I want to use my, sword and cut her head off, and I go flying against the wall. You lob her disgusting head off of her, what counts as a neck, but it's mostly a hump. And it and it flies across the room and hits the stone hits the stone floor making a gushing, squelching sound. Yeah. Wonderful.

Alright. Okay. Oh, we have a downed Cahir. Right. Cahir is unconscious.

Again. I'm bleeding out. Bleeding out. Here, wake up. I am up.

I'm going to use can I, use my medical kit and my medical to bring him whenever the however that works? So back to the Yeah. You can you can treat wounds for sure. Treat wounds, crafting. Where are you?

I have a a medicine, stopped bleeding under first aid, untrained. I'm trying to find the where the heck is it? My skills. Sorry. No.

I've been Yeah. In the bottom, there's a in in the bottom, Basic actions, treat wounds. There well, there there's a There you go. You could do that. Stabilize and stop bleeding?

Or you could just heal him. Mhmm. You are. Also do it. Oh, okay.

Well But there but there is also a treat wounds option that you can administer that, the it's down in the macro section. It's a little plus sign. So either way Alright. Look. I can do both, though.

Right? Right. Alright. Administer first aid. Is that what you're talking about?

Oh, treat wounds. Never mind. Found it. Yeah. Treat wounds.

Right? Right. So, there, there's a there's a macro down there, like, he's little script macro treat wounds. Yes. Treat.

Oh. Hey. Pretty, pretty succeeded. Wow. That's better than a little bit better than my other one.

Awesome. Seventeenth for And then I Woah. Yeah. And then now I will do this. So so I think Cahir has a special ability that makes him heal more when you use first aid for him.

Gotcha. So Yeah. This is pretty good too. It is. Yep.

Yep. Alright. What do you what do you have? He needs a lot more than that. And I am going to, His his his max hit points are 59 if in case you're settled.

Then I'm gonna need all this path. It's 29. So I'm gonna need a few minutes. Where do I find a thing that says I do better? I think it's one of your feats.

Like, I think it's one of your, like, your skill feed over, There you go, buddy. That's two. Alright. While he's doing that, I'm gonna refocus Yep. And then take a look around this room.

Alright. Yep. Three. I will refocus as well. Sounds good.

There's four. That should be good. Right? I gotta apply them all the whole Oh, okay. Trying to find something.

I don't think I lost one. Matter. Good point. I don't think anybody else did. Yeah.

You did. You were the it. You took all of the the hurt. Yeah. Yeah.

You were indeed the you were indeed the focus of the battle, unfortunately. You are the biggest guy, so that makes sense. Yep. K. So you guys, Oh, I yeah.

After the first round of of healing focusing, I would be up, kinda wandering around. The goblin was headed for these little, triangular sections in the wall, which, made me think that he thought there was a way out. And I'd wanna look around just to see if there's more, fanciful writing on the walls. Okay. Give me give me one second.

You're good. But oh, let me see if this trying to get the loot out here. There do you guys have a loot thing showing up for you? I do not see it, but I keep hearing it anyway. Okay.

Yeah. I see it. Increase Carson's range. My what? Oh, yeah.

So I can run farther? I think I need some different armor. Would you like bigger armor? I know, and I cannot lie. But Nice.

I can't lie either. Or I gotta get rid of some stuff, which I'd like a bag of holdings. Excuse me. Alright, Steve Wilson. It's talking a little k.

But you guys are searching around. I need to go use the potty. K. Oh, we got twenty minutes, but I can't I gotta compete. Do you guys see the boss battle loot one in there?

Yes. Mhmm. I'm searching for you. Okay. Had to remember how to do the thing.

Alright. Uh-oh, Clark. Well, speaking of which Mhmm. Somebody was complaining about missing things or something. Right.

Right. Right. I should just somebody should just snag it and then just don't say anything about it. I don't get to joke. What what were we talking about?

The the spacious pouch type one is, this is this game's version of a bag of holding, which is what collects the game planing about. Oh. Cover. Yeah. Yeah.

I think three sessions he's mentioned at one point or the other. In the back of my head, I was just like, just wait. Right. Just wait. It's coming.

And a mystery cloak. Yes. Interesting. And then later on, you know, at some point, just be like, oh, hey. So I open this nice pouch.

Oh, yeah. So, like, there's there's a little there's a little thing in the middle of the room. It's a little black chest. You double click on it that that has all of the loot. How do you find the stats?

You you don't. Oh, there we go. Never mind. Nature of that cloak is, unclear. What's spacious?

It is what is Nothing. Nothing. There's a exact Why don't you tell voice, sir. Why don't you read the if you click on the little edit item thing, it'll give you a little a little say so or click on it, and it'll give you a little tell. Tell you what it does.

Cloth bag. I'm just like, oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.

I don't know, Clark. What's a spacious pouch? Looks like it holds a lot of stuff. Oh, yeah. It looks like it's a bag that holds things.

Oh my gosh. Yay. Look at that. What are the odds? Mhmm.

Up until this point, you guys weren't a high enough level in order to be able to get that magic item. So But Oh, this will make life so much easier. Does anyone want that or can I take that? Does anybody not want that? Right?

New York is one of us has it. I don't really care who. Right? I move at the base of snail if I don't have something to carry a bunch of my stuff. But I'm I'm welcome to carry other people's stuff too.

That's what'll happen. Yeah. And and considering and considering how high magic of a a unique system Pathfinder is, the likelihood that you'll be able to find another one of those and everybody will be able to run around with one at some point or another is pretty high. So Okay. Yeah.

Because then you can I can put a whole bunch of crap in it? Okay. In case you haven't noticed, Pathfinder is a little bit more magically based, a little bit more equipment based than, say, seven of those was. Yeah. A lot more.

Like, almost ridiculous. Like, I'm like, how do you hold all this stuff? Yeah. And among the among the other things, basically, what you find here is there are, just like the the leather and arm the or the armor and the equipment of the goblins and the bugbear. You also among among their possessions, you find three, things that are not standard issue.

One is the spacious pouch. The other is a potion of fire resistance. And then a third one is an unusual cloak, which you will need to take time to identify. What does the cloak look like? It could look great.

The cloak is a reddish color. It's, give me one second. Doesn't give me the information either. Nice. Alright.

So the cloak is Red. Think Stephen Strange. Let's see. Or Dracula. Am I the person most likely to be stared at on fire?

That's the question I'm asking myself right now. Good question. It's a red cape. It appears almost black while in the shadows with a lighter red, mandala pattern on on it that resembles a shuriken. Oh, that's interesting.

Okay. Okay. Cool. Cool. I mean, I could take a look at it and try to identify it, I suppose.

Yeah. I think, ultimately, that is something that will will grab and and take time, you know, elsewhere we spend thinking on it. Yeah. Well, it just takes it's just a, like a downtime action, right, to identify? Right.

Like, ten minutes? Right. Yeah. Yeah. So We could no harm taking ten minutes to try here.

Yeah. We probably have it because Clark just spent, you know, forty five or fifty minutes. Right. Right. So, like, yeah, we probably have time to look that over and Yep.

Yep. Yep. I can do my detect magic, and you can do your detect intelligence and Yeah. So your your detect magic for sure Yes. Will tell you that it is definitely magical.

Okay. I will take it and take a look at it. Alright. And let me see. Did you take the spacious pouch?

I'm pretty sure. You're trying. I don't know how. I'm I have to I have to accept your request. Oh, okay.

Take things. So Alright. I I went through and accepted them. So Kakeru got the potion of fire resistance. Carson got the spacious pouch, and Albert got the unusual cloak.

Once you have it in your inventory, Albert, you should be able to try to identify it from there. Yes. There we go. Occultism, identify magic. Can I, Yeah?

So if you go to the Oh, okay. Boop. I did this for my actions. It's not from the item. Oh, okay.

Can I do it from the item? Yeah. You can. Oh, that's cool. Yeah.

So if you go into your inventory and you go to where the unusual cloak is, you'll see a little, circle with a question mark that's black. You click on that. That should initiate the, initiate the request. Don't see that. Unless okay.

Okay. Hold on. Let me try it from this inventory rather than my character sheet inventory. Alright. I see, nope.

That just puts that in chat again. Yeah. I don't see anything. Interesting. Okay.

Well, maybe it's maybe it's just something that I've got on my end. Oh, okay. Thought that you'd have it on yours as well, but Gotcha. Do do I get to move stuff into the spacious pouch? Yeah.

You should be able to just pull stuff in there. K. Oh, no. It disappeared. Okay.

So your identify your identify, item check did indeed fail. Oh, cool. I swapped to, the the the me. Sameer? Yeah.

Sameer. Holy cow. Wow. That's amazing. Like, Sameer and Khaheer.

I'm like, it's not Khaheer. Khaheer. Yeah. He's not gonna be able to do that. Too many years.

Too many years. Yeah. Black's permission. Great title. You're supposed to be doers of the word, not hearers only people.

Chris, I don't I can't pull it into I'm coming. I'm coming, Omar. I'm coming. K. So we're we're conferring Let me see what I can see.

With the spacious pouch, you've got it. You are currently wearing it. Good. What are you trying to put in the spacious pouch? Pretty much everything.

Well, if you got it in there, you're not gonna have easy access to it. So if it's something that you're gonna need on the fly, then you're definitely not gonna want it in there. Yeah. Most of the stuff I do not need on the fly. I can pick through it.

Okay. I I mean, I can probably keep my backpack out, but, like, all my money, I don't know what I don't know what the deal is. I I just drug I just drug and dropped it. I'm working from your character sheet. Are you working from your character sheet?

No. That could be no. I'm working from your I think I think this is yeah. I think this is one of those examples where you actually have to use your character sheet. Oh, okay.

Well, then that will be different. But I think it's totally different. Okay. Alright. So, Sameer, if you want to identify it, go ahead and roll.

I wanna do crafting or arcane knowledge or Well, so here's so here's the thing. If you do have the crafting skill that allows you to identify items, the crafting, skill, what's it called? I have I think the have it. Elm alchemy. I have identified alchemy.

That doesn't seem like it's quite the right in the crafting. It doesn't it doesn't make sense. The crafting and the arcane are both plus seven. Yeah. So just go ahead and do arcane then.

Call knowledge or identify magic spell, just arcane. You could do yeah. You could do identify magic item if it's got on there or just do just a straight up arcane. I'll just do a straight up arcane. Not a bad roll.

Alright. Oh, I'll talk to you. It was a very good roll. And that very good roll actually will give you the information that you desire. The unusual cloak is what is known as a cape of justice.

Oh. Cape of justice. I went ahead and popped it out on the chat. You'll see a big large blurb about it. But I also did demystify it in your inventory, Ramsey, so you should be able to look at it there too.

I'm still at 20 running. Ah, auction worn by bounty hunters or priests. There. Yeah. There.

It is a pretty interesting little, little item there. Oh, interesting. Interesting. Yeah. Oh, dude.

That's that's just a lot to remember. I'm sorry. I keep on giving you guys more options. I'm having a hard enough time keeping on top of the options you got. Oh, Clark is officially unencumbered for the first time in forever.

Yeah. But my, I can only move 20. Well, that's because you're in full plate. Yeah. That's a tough.

But there are, like, I don't I don't know which skill it is. I think it's athletics, but there are skill feats that allow you to to remove or reduce your speed penalty, that you get from heavy armor. Perfect. I know I know that there's definitely one that allows you to reduce a, reduce check penalties in when you're sneaking and that kind of stuff. So, so something to just keep an eye out for in in skill feeds.

I don't know. What do you think, O. R? You want that? I mean, I don't really think I would want the cloak per se.

Oh, I mean It's usable by anybody, though. Like, it's not just Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

You don't have to be a magic person to use it. Correct. Not saying that it wouldn't make be in good use in the magic users, you know, magic magic user repertoire, but just wanted to make sure that it wasn't just like, well, it's gotta be one of you too. So Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good.

Slip it on and get a demonstration of how it works. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I can certainly take it.

I'm kind of I can't really take anything. Building to be, you know, sort of, support based. Mhmm. So the manacles could could do that. For sure.

I'm not sure how much, if Cahir or Karsten are interested in it. Not I don't know. Karsten would be uninterested for a chisel. Yeah. Could be fun for Kahir.

I didn't I didn't read a thing. So it's the it's basically a cape of justice. What it does is it gives you a plus one item bonus to demoralize creatures just because, and then, you also are able to, touching over here. Well, maybe not the manacles would be the other action would give one of the two of you a ranged option, which is not terrible. It's not a ton of damage, but it could be No.

Could be an introductory. Take and make one penalty. Yeah. So the so it has two actions available to it. One is color.

Basically basically, it allows you to throw force shurikens, at a range of 30 feet. So it give you a 30 feet long range attack. And then the second thing is more of a crowd control thing, which basically allows you to spend it to, encumber a somebody with, manacles, which reduces their movement speed by 15 feet. So they can't really move around as much. Like, if if you guys were going for the long range option, like, when considering it for because it gives you a ranged option, like, I don't think it would necessarily do much for you, Clark, because you already have that ranged option with the Yep.

With the, Kineticist. But, Scott, it could give you an additional ranged option. It also gives you a little bit of versatility in that you'd have a crowd control option available for you as well. Like, if you don't want somebody to be running away from you and you want easy access to them, you could always, like, blast them with the manacles and then and then attack them, you know, and that kind of thing. So not a bad option.

Maybe not something you'll do every single turn, but when it's useful, it's useful. Right. On the the shuriken's once per hour. The manacles are once per day. Mhmm.

Right. So Right. Yeah. But it's a low level magic item, which is why it's got those why it's got those limitations on. So Mhmm.

But still could be useful in the right situation. If a neat thing. And it automatically does give you that plus one for demoralizing. So if you're trying to intimidate somebody or anything, it can give you a plus one for that. So I'm fine if you wanna take it, Ramsey.

Or if you think I should take it, I'm fine to take it. It doesn't matter to me. But you don't have a ranged option. You having something much better than nothing. I usually just move two people to 35.

But That's true. Yep. But you will find yourself in the situation at some point or another where there are people that you wanna attack that you can't get to. Yeah. The the first thing that flies.

Right. High jump, long jump, tight or sweat. Well, that could work in a lot of situations, but not all situation. So I think you can have it because I don't wanna think about it at the moment. Sure.

Sure. Sure. It's 10:10 o'clock. So Alright. I'll I'll hang on to it for now.

I mean, we can always, you know Yeah. We can pass it around. Yep. Okay. Yep.

Nobody nobody's committing to this having to be part of your character's business with an Nope. Whatever. And if none of us really want it, we can always sell it. Yep. Mhmm.

Find something else. You know? Right. I really wanna throw spears, but I haven't figured out that. So Yeah.

Well, I will also oh, picking stuff. Gonna change shirt. Alright. The last thing that I wanna leave you guys with as you're going through the room picking up different items, finding figuring this stuff out, you do some of you or both of you or all of you or somebody happens across the arrow slits and looks outside. Okay.

And what you see is Not perfectly fine. Is this out the window. Which is a ball. And for, for Clark or Karsten and I think Samir as well. You guys were both doing, like, act out outside the outside the, town Mhmm.

Mhmm. Raids with goblins. Right? Yeah. Patrolling and yep.

Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So you two both recognize this as the Burned Woods. And I would say that even Auer and Kahir would have a little bit of an idea about what the Burned Woods look like because it's one of the major, landmarks close to your town.

But it's not close to your town. It's, like, two or three weeks away from your town. Alright. Oh, That's In which direction? Problematic.

Southwest. Okay. Southwest. And Toronto. Is that what we were trying to go find with my brother?

Oh, you're in we have to move the direction. Nope. Nope. That was the direction that you guys were headed to Uh-huh. Face the goblins because the goblins were coming from that general direction.

From Burnwood. Yeah. In Burnwood. Yeah. Interesting.

Okay. So there is, A teleportation going on. Yeah. Or some Weird. Something kind of wacky coming off the temple of time.

Right. Right. Yeah. Well, I did want to yeah. That that also I did wanna make sure that I I did do a little bit of a retcon a retcon, but it wasn't a serious retcon.

I just renamed the Temple Of Time. It's still something that you guys aren't probably gonna remember, which is fine. But it is now, the lua kini o kawa You're o ka manawa, which in the old which in the old language is Temple Of Time. Yeah. I'm alright.

I'm not expecting you to remember the name of that, but I I figured I should keep my I should keep my ancient name my ancient names, like, in the same general dialect. So so I changed it. Just just had a quick thought, Chris. Why don't we, just change the old ancient dialect to English? Yeah.

It's it's less it's less mysterious. Alright. Right? I'm sorry. For the same reason why for the same reason why one of my one of my GMs for one of my GMs for, his game that he ran had a book of angels names and only gave and only gave NPCs names of angels.

Really? Because it's weird and interesting and fun. That is true. So, our ancient language is Hawaiian? It is a cross pollination between Hawaiian and and, Samoan.

How did you say? Okay. It it's an islander dialect. For sure. Yep.

Okay. Try to be a jerk. That was a funny one. But it's a funny one. No.

Absolutely. Like, I like, everybody everybody uses Latin. Oh. Everybody uses Greek. Yep.

Everybody uses, like, some ancient version of a European language for their for their ancient languages. Everybody uses Nordic. I'm using Islander. So because I have to be unique. Gosh darn it.

You were born that way. Yeah. Maybe I was made that way by by solid by solidly being corrupted by my parents. Made me have to be more made me have to be weird. That's funny.

Yeah. Yeah. Awesome. So that's that's it. That's all I got, guys.

So just wanted to Oh, that's great. Make sure that you're gonna pull you back into the Goblin Tunnels because that's where you actually are. Yeah. Automatic. And is everybody everybody healed up and good at this point?

We should be. Yeah. Yeah. I just wanna make sure that we're that that we're able to hit the ground running next time we meet so we don't have to worry about healing anybody or anything since I still got everybody on the call. So alright.

We'll let you go. Thank you, everybody. Really appreciate you guys sticking around for post 10:00 activities. Thanks, Chris. It was good.

Yes. Have a fun time. Yes. Yes. Alright.

See you later. Thank you. Good night. Good night, guys. Have a good night.

It's a nice curve ball there, bud.
