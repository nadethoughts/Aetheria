so we'll go ahead and jump into
activate all right we'll pop you guys back into the um into the battle map
here so you got gar lunk the ranger to make himself scarce
as you had convinced him that you were going that you were his
deity and uh you were going to punish the um the witch and monk
for their in subordination i believe was was what you guys were talking about
yeah sounds all right yeah so he got great pleasure out of this
and decided to go the other direction um now you guys are in this place where
you are um on a cliff top
there are some there's a way for you to kind of step down
into like run down into it but it'll be slower or you can go over to the cliff face
around here and just drop down and if memory serves i think our had a
parachuting cannonball
um so not not quite feather fall uh but i have a scroll that will literally make
stairs or a ladder but probably stairs um so wherever we want that
we can probably get down there pretty quick
but i leave that up to the two gentlemen that are going to be you know getting into melee
but my kind of thought is so we don't have to sneak around a whole lot like we can just
pop it down like right here going straight down
just make a stairwell and y'all can just run on down and do what you do best
i mean that seems pretty uh
uh he saw it to me
all right well
so are ready want to get into position uh then we can uh
uh let me kick this off because they're currently still unaware of us
mm-hmm are currently still unaware that is true
this oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
what's our distance
that farm
what do you mean like how far are we from these people
am i like 30 feet above them am i
i just have no concept um you are about
uh you're i believe the drop is a 30 foot drop okay
okay i it's not a i believe it is a 30 foot drop um from from here um now from maybe with these lower
ones though it's obvious it's going to be about five five feet lower each each cleft you do so it's
it's okay 30 25 here
let me do the thing all right 25 here 15 here
and here and then five so 30 from here okay all righty
so this is primarily a scott and clark question um where do you want to attack from
the moment that these stairs appear we're going to start combat because
they're gonna notice that wait a minute
and you're going down does that count like the 30 feet is that one move then
well
um going going down um
it would um
depending on how you decide to do if you jump then you can move the full 30 feet without spending any movement
um going down the stairs you'll probably um it'll probably be i'd say
all things considered you know you're probably looking at 20 feet of actual like
movement spent uh to get down the stairs so you want to make sure that you're positioning yourself
appropriately yep yep yep and quick jump skill feet does not apply because we're falling right
right
i'm fine to walk down some stairs let's get it rocking um
um chris i would i need i need some help with this uh considering the terrain it just makes a whole
lot of sense for me to grab some of this loose rubble here and do a telekinetic you know
us even better with a little bit of violence there you know um
in an effort
um yeah it's just i don't know so i guess part of what i'm wondering is can can would it be like um
i've already just dropped something 30 feet
right in and of itself that's going to do an amount of damage is there a way to to calculate that
um or would you just stick with the the 2d6 from the spell
yeah so at least if you're using telekinetic projectiles
um we would just be sticking with the uh the damage that's that's given from the from the stone
uh or from the from the spell yeah yeah um and then if we did something differently
is does it make more sense to do something that's natural i'm going to invoke the laws of
of physics here as your friend or does it make sense to do it as a spell i guess is kind of what
i'm asking because i don't i don't know how you would potentially calculate the damage well according
to the according to the rules um you're probably not going to be able to um you're probably not
going to be able to like you know get some additional damage dice for um for lobbing stones from a great
height however if you have an idea of something that you want to do ditch it to me and i'll i'll see and
i'll see what i can do make sense yeah and so i guess largely what i'm what i'm thinking and and
this isn't like it wouldn't be an exact replica but like if i could take like this stone right there
um that's a fairly heavy stone and you know drop it from from this point over here or
faucet down onto our dear friend here or our dear lady friend over here it doesn't matter to me um
would that be a more so i'm asking if that's more effective as a way to do it could i do that
as an attack and i i guess is the question um i yeah so that would be more of an um an attack
yeah that would be that would be an attack um and especially if you're going with something that's
like um that's large like that i mean this is like a that's like a five foot
breath yeah it's probably a little bit more than i can manage um yeah i mean if you you would be
required to to have a little bit more strength to do it yeah than my plus zero yes yeah yeah so you
know obviously something that's appropriate to size i guess you know like that one is a right
there's um other ones in here that are a little bit smaller so as far as like what falling damage
does falling damage does one die six per ten foot traveled so okay even like even if you did hit
um you'd be doing about three d6 damage to whatever it was that you hit uh it's two two d6 on
uh the the spell so it's not yeah it's not um and more but right and you're to hit with that would
definitely be a dexterity um and even potentially a us potentially a strength just depending um
well actually it would be dexterity because range is always dexterity in this game um so you know you
probably don't have as good of a dexterity um as you do a charisma so it would be gaining
effectively plus two on dex instead of a plus four on charisma right so you'd effectively be gaining
potentially one more die of damage but you would be losing um
um but you'd be losing uh plus two or you'd be losing two on your hit on your to hit so it's kind of a
more like more less likely to hit more likely to um potentially more damage yeah
uh okay all right all right well
i love where your head's at uh anybody anybody else want to take a
out at some of these up and boulders on their head
um you would need a more dexterous group to want to actually set a blob and
rocks effectively yeah that's not our forte yep
yep i got other plans yeah okay um all right i i will probably stick with the um
yeah the telekinetic projectile um for the sake of actually being able to hit um
um in which place if i may i would try to do something of that um
to to make it seem like one of them was throwing it at the other one
okay let's see about maybe getting a little so are you guys planning on doing more espionage style
stuff it's that kind of sounds like what you're talking about jason
that's what i'm thinking about i'm imagining that you know might be able to
get something of that to to pull off um almost i guess is like an ambush attack or like whatever
just ahead of okay just to just to get something
no i i definitely uh i definitely like where your head's at and i definitely think that would be
cool i'm just trying to figure out as far as like um
yeah the logistics yeah because i mean right now i'm not making i'm not making you guys make
stealth rules because you're not actually in a place where you're where it it specifically matters
but the moment that you start actually sneaking around or up or getting up there or that kind
of stuff um i will be requiring stealth checks to um see if you're able to actually pull off your
shenanigans so um so if you're if you guys are wanting to do anything like quick acting or something like
that um i would be willing to kind of like since ramsey's plan is to build that stair
i would basically give everybody else in the in the group like two actions that they can use um
and then we would start initiative so if you want to use that as the telekinet telekinetic projectile
jason you took you can totally do that but if you also want to go and do your um your super secret
like you know try and get the goblins to start fighting each other and um potentially have them
do your work for you um then we can totally do that um just need to get people to start making some checks
and make that happen
um
all right so uh i don't know if you could do this again or not randy um what's that
how closely you could do it uh but but if um
what if i you know do a little telekinetic toss and
hit the the monk there as if it was coming from the the witch chick
um and that might start a little dialogue and so i'm wondering if if your guy could be
in our ranger character form-esque um to kind of encourage the hostilities
so jason i don't want to put a wrinkle in your plan but i am looking at the telekinetic projectile
and it's got a range of 30 feet yeah i'd have to use which means you need to be 30 feet away from
whoever it is you're attacking in order for that to happen so your positioning would need to be
very different than where you are right now right um still doable but i did did just want to point that
out yeah i was um planning to do the reach bell so that i could make it 60 feet
okay okay and i think i didn't really look i guess closely
i guess he's 65 feet away from where you currently are right so i would just need to inch closer a little bit
okay
so i'm so what's here and carson doing in the middle of this
because we're just kind of huddled up you know having a little convo here like what are we going
to do yeah i'm throwing out some suggestions you guys tell me what you what you want to do what you
really want to do 65 linear feet but you're about 30 feet up so oh is that how that's running right
now yeah okay yeah yeah yeah be a little bit you have to be a little bit closer yeah i would probably
need to position myself more like over here yeah you'd need to be um maximum uh 40 45 feet away from
um 45 feet away in order to be able to do that
yeah i can do and you would need to be at the edge as well um because you'd need to have line of sight
i mean maybe not exactly on the very edge but you'd need to be closer to the edge
have line of sight yeah yeah yeah so those those are my ponderings thoughts anybody other thoughts
i'm just getting behind carson ready to go down the steps okay yeah that just kind of seems like
that's what i'd be doing as well you you make the stairs ramsey uh or jason you throw a distraction
stairs get made and we go running down the stairs
the stairs are faster than jumping down the rocks and letting them shoot at us correct
yes faster but definitely safer
fall as fast as you're gonna get but it can't hurt right right you would be taking 3d6 damage
jumping versus um running down the stairs so yeah i'm assuming these people have powers as well
i imagine they got something
would expect
um i'm totally game for that it doesn't make a lick of difference to me how how we do it so
all right if you if you just put the stairs up and you know we're we're good for that
are you sure you don't want to do any any fancy footwork there jason
sound like at the beginnings of some sort of plan i don't want to i don't want to just
you i don't want to discourage creativity and it sounded like you had something going on
um so if you do want to throw it throw out the distraction um in order to be able to get into
position to be able to hit the monk um i would require a stealth check from you to be to be able
to move up without getting any uh without getting observed um and then once you succeed that stuff
check um and i'll even i'll even tell you what the uh what the dc for that you don't
gotta tell me about the dc it doesn't oh i i'm gonna i'm not gonna do it oh boy
i'll say it's not everyone in this group is stealthy like our last one
no no that's not that's not what i'm getting at at all
you can tell me it's a five i'm still gonna roll a two right right it doesn't it doesn't matter what
the dc check is in order to not be observed by anyone you would need to roll a 21 or above
on your stock check oh my god oh oh
that's that yeah i don't think i'm gonna roll a 21 just so you know
with my plus two i'm not yeah
that would start combat correct uh if you are observed that would initiate combat yes
i mean it might not initiate people attacking right away but it would definitely make me roll
make me have you guys roll initiative right yeah
so still jason totally doable and like i'm i'm giving you this complete information so you can
make an informed decision about what you'd want to do um the witch specifically looks like she's a
a little bit more observant than the monk um
her eyes are darting back and forth being a little bit more observant
um they do seem to be talking about um as you guys are kind of having this conversation the
uh the words of of the two kind of lift up above the uh above the cliff um and they're talking about
um they're talking about uh how their masters is is going to be completing the key um
within the next couple of hours they have all the ingredients that that are needed
so jason do you want to sneak
uh
no
i rolled a five oh look at that you will you rolled above of you above what you rolled above
the three i mean this is a great roll i failed by 10 points all right
so jason i will uh since you did make that stealth roll or since you
were making this stuff roll you can move to wherever you want um and then at that point
um i would like everybody to roll initiative so let's do that move to your position jason
right you want me to do that now
and then that's a great spot right then we'll go ahead and start combat
uh
there we go good old two good old faithful
there we go
how do i close my um
my uh character sheet it's not closing
did you pop it out uh no i did not pop it out but i will try
okay that works that's weird
say if you pop it out a lot of times the controls won't respond yeah no i did not pop it out that
time and they weren't responding so
i thought it was weird yeah
right um so samir moves up to get get into a good position to do some shenanigans and um
um when he when he when he does um
sorry guys the uh the monk um and the witch both say you know they both kind of look up in that general
direction um and the witch specifically says
she says um
she says hey
that's not gerlunk
and
you will begin the encounter
oh we are
what do you mean i'm not
all right uh she she points you out
um and she will go ahead and
um
my kids really sound like they're going to bed huh
i'm sure everybody can hear them
okay so she points at you with her finger um and a um a bolt of divine energy comes out of her
out of her pointer finger
divine wow
nice job jason i don't do much for divine
wow um
oh that's a
that's a big number
that's a crit
oh boy
um
you did my eerie flicker
you did your eerie flicker all right so that means that you are concealed
get him
oh yeah
yeah 34 that's huge
holy crap who did you hit you
yeah
good
okay gotta do a dc
five flat check to see if it actually does hit
yeah it does hit oh yeah
it does yeah
all right
she she done she done did done did gotcha
dealing 15 points
of oh wait wait
only 30 points of damage
doing 30 points
wow
of damage to you
um
okay and then she's gonna cast you dead
oh no mostly dead
jeez
applied
um all right so she uh
she does that
okay
here you're up next
am i allowed to allow
alwar to go in front of me
yeah you can you can um take yourself out of initiative order and place yourself right after alwar
that's what you want to do let's do that all right i'll work you're next all right sick uh we're gonna do the thing
um
i've been looking at this scroll of helpful steps in my hand so we're gonna use it uh two actions
uh burn that scroll so we're gonna make a set of stairs starting probably from this square right here i would imagine
and just going straight down boop boop boop boop boop boop boop
oh perfect that's gravy train um
yeah so yeah i kind of yeah perfect that's exactly what i was thinking
perfect looks great
there you
um
oh that's awesome
uh and then we're gonna say the words
abracadabra
barrageous anthems
uh okay that's plus one
oh yeah i'm gonna do it okay
additional plus one there okay
what is that
a roll
oh that is not a great
result uh but
okay all right that's fine i'll just have to do it again next round not a big deal
all right cool that's me
all right
here you're up apparently you're going first buddy sorry
is that truly only 30 feet for me to get down to her or 35 yeah that is that's what it says
that's what dumb stairs are for unless chris is lying to you and it's a trap
i am i am not i'm not being crap zero craps are being happening right now
i gotta remember how to play the game
i know right
you're fired so scott the trick is
big big axe and you swing it
well i was like where do i do that at i've forgotten all right
what if we try to hit them harder
that was so close what was that oh wow
oh what the frick that's that's pretty amazing i don't think i've ever seen you roll that low scott
yeah right so close to a 20.
do we re-roll with a hero point yes yes you do i got one more try here
that was terrible
i'm sorry that was my recommendation
there you go
i didn't roll two things um okay that's nice
the classification i think that was i think jason
rolled something as well while you were doing your reroll
i did yes sorry
so let's see here
that was my flat check uh on the backlash for the
you rolled a 12
i think i have to do that one time i use it
which uh modified to a 19 to hit
um and she has a 23 ac so you missed
even with your hero point
and do a hero point oh you didn't do a hero point you just swung again
all right i'll be right back yeah
all right so that's your three actions
yeah but i might use a hero point here
well you did roll it you still missed so
you wanna right whoa yeah yeah there's a chance that you'll hit if
like if you roll above a three he needs a 21 okay well i'll just take a hit or two from
both of them and die and then i'll go to bed so i'll but that'll be my turn
i that's not mcclellan
but yeah i can you want to use your hero point i mean you
every hour so yeah just use a hero point
no i should have used it like you said the first try
yeah you do also have a re-roll for
your class ability i think you've got or your your race racial ability so keep that in mind as
well i i keep on forgetting about that but you do have a re-roll i'm aware but if i re-roll it
i still am at the negative one right so yeah
yeah i'm good all right this guy runs up over to you
the little monk goblin
i'm gonna do a flurry of kicks
now i'm back he's going to
did he squish her uh no he missed ah so he's gonna swing ah
the roundhouse kicks you in the face
for six points of damage
and swing again
he's gonna roundhouse kick you in the face
for nine damage
and then he's going to do one more
how can he do four actions
because he used a flurry of kicks ability which cost him one action and allows him to attack twice
i thought he had to move to get well he did so he's only used two actions so far one to move
one to kick you twice oh wait it kicks twice with the flurry of kicks yes
and then he's going to use his last action to kick you a third time or at least attempt to and miss
yes um so he basically like
only missionaries
for those but
so he's like this this little goblin just kind of runs up to you and just
starts taekwondo in new in the face and he's just like kick kick kick kick
and karsten you are now up i'm up and i'm gonna hopefully be able to make it right to that guy
or not how do i move he is 35 feet away from you really
can i hit him right there
um well actually clark i have my skates of coolness so i think i can move five more feet
well i'm thinking memory serves you have
um
sudden charge you've got sudden charge um
so your sudden charge
allows you to dash twice
uh
and swing so you stride twice and attack for two actions
oh yeah
so you could just get down there and attack and those are two actions and you have a third action you
can spend doing something else all right well i'm gonna whack them right not with that i'm not
there we go maybe
uh and wait but or i can can i do all of my actions and do
um
a little double slice
yeah so double slice would be a different action the sudden charge would only allow you to strike
oh okay double slice will give you um we'll do the double attack for one action so you could run up
attack and then do a double slice um or your double size would be at the
second let's not do that we'll just we'll just do the regular one all right here we go
i'll take that it looks like a hit yay just damage
oh oh that is awful
all right and then i i'll attack again
okay um do you want to double slice with that one can i double slice with that it's a it's at a
negative five correct it would be um so when you do get the double slice um pop up just pick the
map negative five option but you can totally double slice with that oh well then totally gonna try that
open uh demo i'm clicking on it but how do i get it to um if you click on the play button next to
double slice or the use button that should pop up the dialogue it does but it oh first attack second
attack right yep winter dawn oh is that it oh oh yeah so i'm sorry the multiple attack will be at
bottom just put it at map make five and they'll do it shoot
look at me i'm clark i've got like i hit with both of my no it's good awesome i did it yeah you hit
with both of them yeah you rolled really well on that so go ahead and roll your damage
that one's much better
yeah all right you decimated you just made it for
the poor as it be any he he be gone that's right
all right all right samir you're up
my uh all right i'm exactly 30 feet from the chick there okay um and then of course that's just lateral
so horizontal so horizontal would add a bit more so hold um
oh you did um also heal one of your spell slots when we started combat
regain a spell slot
um that you had to that you had to spend by the end of the combat
yeah i'm trying to gosh i can't remember what that is now um
oh yeah that's the wellspring
so i guess my my point is you could use a level spell slot and not miss anything because you
you have refreshed one right um yeah um
i think it's no good kind of snow again it's no good
no no
um
fun um hmm not probably um
It's slashing, right?
It's slashing, yeah.
No idea.
Slashing.
I would say it does a lot of damage, but you got to hit first.
Hmm.
Yeah.
I would think he's going to die after her turn by one of your compatriots.
Yeah.
Right, yeah.
I'm really hoping.
I just, yeah, I'm looking at different things.
I think probably this is the way to do it.
Hello.
Thank you.
I'm going to do a thunderstripe.
I think.
Okay.
I want to see their reflex.
That's a crit failure.
That's harsh.
That was really bad.
All right.
Well, roll damage.
Roll damage.
He crit success against him, so that sounds about right.
It's fair.
It's fair.
Yeah, okay.
Right, yeah.
Roll a three on that D12.
Good job.
So, she takes 14 damage, but also, the more important thing about this is, um, what?
Does thunderstripe not have a critical failure's, um, thing?
No.
Is she wearing metal armor?
Let me see.
Yep.
All right.
Well, she's not clumsy one.
I, I thought a lot of the spells have, like, on a crit failure, this catastrophic thing isn't damage happens.
So, I was, I was just assuming that there was going to be something bad that happens here.
So, um, all right.
So, she takes 14 damage, uh, for her crit fail.
And, Samira, you still have one action.
What are you going to do with that?
Okay.
Um, I will, how do I, um, change direction here?
Um, I think that you press the X button and it should switch direction.
No?
No, it's not doing it.
Like, just tap it.
Don't press and hold it.
Just tap it and move it.
Still no?
It didn't do that.
Um, well, you can move that way.
Yeah.
Okay.
It did its thing, I guess.
All right.
Yep.
Oh, that's bad, I guess.
Can you move up behind, Carson?
Okay.
Um, now it is Minnagul's turn.
She is going to look at the big hulking guy that tried to attack her but failed.
But he looks dangerous.
Yeah, I'd say so.
Um.
Um.
Uh, she is going to reach out and touch him.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
She can touch us all, looks like.
Yeah.
I think she's going to do that 30-foot emanation.
Oh.
Oh.
Great.
Ah, the harms.
I'm immune.
I'm immune.
You're immune to harm?
Yep.
Really?
I mean, it's somewhere buried in my stuff.
But, you know, you might have to be able to check.
I don't specifically remember that.
Um, I'm going to need everybody to make a DC 24 basic fortitude save outside of Alwar,
because he's too far back.
So roll, just roll a fortitude save, right?
Yeah.
I might be using my hero point.
It's a thing, right?
Oh, I'm definitely using my hero point.
Yeah, you're looking for a DC 24.
Yeah, that's ridiculous, by the way.
Did I not do it right?
No, you did it right.
I would like to read.
How do I do that?
Oh, here we go.
Yep, yep.
Oh, I rolled a nine.
Look at that.
Okay.
So everybody failed.
Who wants to use their hero point?
I am.
Oh, come on.
I do, but I can't see mine.
Do you see mine in the chat?
I rolled a one.
Oh, yeah.
Here you had a 13 that you rolled.
It's actually under the spell.
If you look under the spell, you'll see your name and a little 13.
What a crock.
If you right click on that, you should be able to re-roll.
I'm pissed.
I might save that one now.
Okay.
Samir did succeed.
I can't figure out how to re-roll.
If you left click on your roll.
Well, he's used it in the.
Oh.
Oh.
Just this pop-up message.
If you click on the little castle next to your.
If you click on the little castle next to the 13.
Oh, there it is.
That'll give you a pop-up to be able to re-roll with using hero point.
Okay.
Okay.
So, Kahir passed and Samir passed.
Karsten did not pass.
All right.
Let's go ahead and roll some damage, shall we?
That's not that bad.
So, Kahir takes nine.
Samir takes nine.
Oh, yeah.
Or takes four.
I'm sorry.
How much?
Kahir takes four.
Oh.
And Karsten takes nine.
Oh.
So, she basically looks at you guys and just, you see, you see fright in her eyes.
And she, a huge blast of necrotic energy just emanates from her.
Giving all of you guys a, a bit of a, a bit of a kick of, um, it's kind of the evil heebie-jeebies.
Which makes you feel like you took some damage.
And then, um, Alwar, you are up.
Alwar is perfectly fine.
Yeah.
Good job.
She is not very hurt.
Uh, what do I do?
I think I just do the thing, right?
Samir is not feeling good.
No, no, he's not.
Oh, yeah.
I can do, I forgot about that.
Um.
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.
That sounds fantastic.
All right.
Uh, step.
One.
Well, hmm.
Sorry, hang on a second.
Um.
Where is it?
I knew I had.
Um.
Yep, nope.
We're just gonna do the thing.
Uh, so step one, we need to be able to see.
Uh, so I'm going to walk closer.
Let's get, um, just to the edge here, I suppose.
Uh, two, we're gonna put, uh, put the thing back up.
Uh.
The Courageous Anthem.
Okay, that's better.
That'll last for three rounds the way it should.
Not that this combat's gonna last that long.
But that's all right.
Uh, okay, so that was two.
And then for three, uh, we are going to.
I'm gonna go get a snack.
Um.
Use.
For three, we're getting a snack.
Three, we're getting a snack.
Uh, all right.
Uh, three, I'm gonna use my Vitality Network, uh, to transfer one hit point to Karsten,
giving him an immediate move action because of the rhythm bond.
Oh, yeah.
Feel the rhythm, feel the rhyme.
So Karsten will get an instant move when he returns from his snack.
It's bobsled time.
How's that go?
Yeah.
No, that's feel the rhythm, feel the rhyme.
Come on now, it's bobsled time.
Get on up, yeah, yeah, it's bobsled, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Or get on up, it's bobsled.
Cool run-ins.
I was, I haven't seen that in a hot minute.
I recently, uh, like, more recently, like, two years ago, I watched it.
Um.
Holds up.
Holds up.
Yep, nice, nice.
Like, I was kind of walking into that beat, like, oh, I'm not sure, but no, it's, it's
good, it's good.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, good, good, good.
It's like, am I going to ruin my childhood with this, so.
Right, right.
All right, and after Karsten makes his move, I am, I am out.
That is my three.
Okay, that makes, uh, Kahir, next.
Yep.
And I'm assuming, slash hoping, Karsten's going to take that move to, move into flank.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That was a big one.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That was my plan, anyway.
Is, is Clark back from his snack?
I am.
Okay, you get a free move.
Um, Alwar gave you a free move.
So, you can move up to your movement speed.
Um.
Oh, I can't move my guy.
Blank.
Oh, it's because we're in combat, um, we'll do free movement.
There you go.
Give it a try now.
Ah, there we go.
Hey, I can move my guy.
Uh, is there attacks of opportunity?
Um, there are, but not every monster has them.
Oh, well then, forget you, I'm going to go right there.
It is unlikely a witch has attacks of opportunity.
It is unlikely that a spellcaster has an attack of opportunity.
Yes.
Yes.
Um, and she does not swing at you, so you're good.
All right.
I'll say the monk may be dead.
Yes.
It's possible that the monk would have, but it is very unlikely that the witch did.
All right, um, Scott, you're up.
Ouch.
That's a hit.
Does it hit?
It's a big axe and he hits her over the head.
Oh, it's going to be dead.
Why did I even need to move?
Oh, because it helps him kill it.
Oh, there's literally no way that Kahir will have killed her with this one hit.
What?
It's not possible.
The monk was way wussier than the witch.
Right.
Not a witch mere wife.
Meh.
Meh.
Meh.
Those little sound effects are great.
I guess we'll try again.
Why not?
I'm so close to a 20.
Oh, these people.
Why not?
We'll do it again.
Miss.
Miss.
All right.
So you swing, you get her once, but are unable to connect with your remaining.
Three attacks as she dances out of your way, pointing in your face and laughing at you.
Carson.
You're up.
Oh, I get angry that she's laughing at him.
I'm going for it.
Get her.
I would like to do, uh, it's not double strike though.
I thought I had something else.
Um, there's, you have double slice.
You also have the one where you are flanked and you can attack both people at the same time.
I thought it was like you retributed strike, reactive strike.
Nope.
Maybe it is double strike.
I thought it was something else.
Retributive strike is if somebody attacks one of your opponents and you're within range, you, uh, reactive strike you get, which is, um, like if they move out of your range, you get to attack them.
But all right, well, I guess I'm going to, I'm going to double strike.
Uh, you've got the aggressive block.
Um, oh, here I go.
Right.
I mean, that, is that correct?
That I thought I had a different, I thought I had a, like a different, there was a different strike.
I think I had, that was, I thought it was a different strike.
You got blasting beams, you got double slice, you got quick reversal, um, sudden charge, react, um, aggressive block, wind step.
Okay, maybe it's, maybe it's double slice.
I really thought there was something else.
All right.
I mean, select a different weapon.
Oh.
That's better.
Looks like a hit.
That looks like another hit.
Boom.
I knew she should have, I knew she should have used her shield and not done the, the nuking
harm.
Yeah.
That's great.
Come on, man.
For me?
So, 17, 10.
All right.
You whack her twice, and she is still up.
It says not feeling good.
Feeling good.
Oh, she's definitely not feeling good.
I didn't, I didn't say she wasn't feeling good.
But, but you never said that she did.
And I want you to confirm that I'm.
Okay.
Okay.
Clark, Clark, she is not feeling good at all.
She is still alive, though.
But she is not feeling good.
Thanks, Chris.
I appreciate that.
No problem.
Happy to do that for you.
So, you've used one action for your double slice.
Oh.
Are you going to.
Can I double slice her again?
Yeah.
You can double slice as much as you want.
Oh.
Well, then I'm just going to keep double slicing.
Great.
But I just take the penalty, right?
Yeah.
You take the multiple attack penalty on it.
I don't think I hit.
Oh.
Yes.
Hit.
So, you hit with the shield.
Go ahead and roll damage on that.
Oh.
Not the winner's dawn, the shield.
Oh, sorry.
Yeah.
There we go.
It said damage, so I was like, oh, but you have to confirm it.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
So, on the, um, if you, if you look at the little, there's a little target button that
pops up on the correct button to press for damage.
So, you always know if there's something to press, there's a little target that pops up
on there.
Oh.
So, um, but she does take that additional 12 damage, like you whack at her with the
winner's dawn.
She dances out of the way and then bash her with your shield.
That's right.
With your shield spike piercing through, uh, piercing through her robes.
Um, she was laughing at, um, here, but she's not laughing so much anymore.
She has, um, she has a more serious look in her eyes, but she's still alive.
All right.
I'm going to whack at her.
She is at death's door.
I'm going to whack at her one more time.
Okay.
This is just like a helmet.
Yeah, not so much.
Maybe.
All right.
Yeah.
Both of your, your last two attacks do, in fact, miss.
Miss?
Yeah.
Just go away.
Samir, you've got a, uh, a witch that's looking pretty, uh, pretty harried at the moment.
Um, and, well, we'll, um, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so anyway, um, I'm going to take
a, uh, little chunk, uh, uh, a stick from the fire that's, you know, burned down to, uh,
decent point on the end.
And, um, we'll just do a little, a little kinetic projectile in the piercing form.
All right.
I click on that.
Yes.
Yes, you do.
And then in the dialogue in the chat, um, you choose which one, and then you do your attack.
Okay.
Let's see if you hit.
And I miss.
By four.
You miss by four.
Um.
All right.
Do you have a, uh, do you have a hero point at this moment?
No, I don't.
Well, you do have one, one more action that you can spend.
Um.
Hmm.
This, uh, might be an opportunity to do, uh, like, uh, an intimidation or something of that
nature, yeah?
Fear, maybe?
Uh, yeah.
You could totally do that.
All right.
Looking to see if any of your focus spells were one action.
Unfortunately, they're not.
I don't think I have anything under a two.
You got shield, so.
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Shield.
Okay.
She's still targeted, so.
Yeah.
I'll, um.
I'll do the intimidation thing.
Okay.
Let her go.
Oh.
No, that's not going to work.
All right.
Dude.
Dude.
You're killing me.
You're killing me.
Oh.
I've gotten a couple twos today.
Wow.
Tough board.
You, you are apparently not scary at all, Samir.
No.
No.
This is terrible.
This is terrible.
Ugh.
Ugh.
Okay.
So she is at death's door.
She is going to use target herself, and she is going to cast Sanctuary.
Sanctuary?
Mark, since you happen to have a reactive strike, and she's casting a spell within, within range
of you, you have the opportunity to attack her if you want.
Oh, yes.
As you're using your reaction.
Uh, yes.
So you will just need to use a regular strike.
Okay, red team.
Uh...
Nope.
Yep.
Right there.
And...
Where?
You do hit.
So roll damage.
You hit on a seven, huh?
Nice job.
That's right.
Aw.
Aw.
That's right.
She was casting Sanctuary to be able to protect herself from you guys attacking her, but as
she, as she attempts to complete the spell, um, Karsten, how do you kill her?
Slice off her head.
While she's distracted, you take the opportunity to lob off her head.
Heh heh heh heh heh heh.
Nineteen points of damage?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, well, that's pretty good.
That's a lot of damage.
I mean...
I'm catching up to here.
Uh...
All right.
Well, good job.
Catching up.
Thanks.
You did it.
All right.
Um...
Let's see here.
Uh...
Let's go ahead and auto-assign.
Um...
Ooh!
XPs.
You guys actually get a little bit more XP than what...
Um...
Than what, uh, is in there because...
Uh, you...
Were able to...
Get the other goblin to...
Walk away.
Yeah, very nice to that goblin, by the way.
Oh, I suspect we may not have seen the last of him.
What?
Mm-hmm.
Ha ha ha!
For now!
Oh!
Um...
Okay.
So...
There you go.
Woo!
So...
You finish off the goblins.
Okay.
So you're looking around in the...
Looking around the camp.
Um...
What...
What...
What do you...
Um...
So as far as like...
As far as stuff in the camp is concerned...
Like, over in this direction...
Um...
There's a cave that enters into the rock formation.
Um...
Um...
There is the entrance over here.
Uh, the rest of the camp is pretty self-explanatory.
Like food, rations, gunpowder.
You know.
The basics.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Is that what these barrels are, Chris?
Are these gunpowder barrels?
Uh, yeah.
Uh...
Interesting.
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
I would just be kind of looking at...
Noted.
Um...
And...
Then...
Searching the bodies...
You find...
Um...
Little things...
Which I have posted in the chat...
Awful.
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Not useful currently...
But neat.
Uh...
Another occult scroll case?
apparently they're all over the place
oh hey
fine I don't think I need a second
one but we could sell it at some
point probably
let's see what else so the camp
has again
there's food those barrels are full
of gunpowder there's that cave
entrance you do notice
a bit of a
natural glow coming
from the cave so
it seems to be
there seems to be something going on in that
general direction
the way that everything is
specifically positioned
it definitely looks like this
fortress was created to
create some sort of
hover
for the cave
specifically
or you know to protect the cave
specifically
but
yeah
where's the cave again
caves over by the
x
here
so there's a cave that basically goes in
this direction
I don't know if I could use any of that other stuff in there so
at the very least you can probably
sell things
yeah yeah yeah yeah
so
these are
as far as the
as far as the treasure
is concerned here
a majority of it is just
randomly generated so
like I just
roll
this is what it gives me
if it looks like
something that could
potentially be useful
for you guys
I keep it
otherwise I'll
otherwise I'll skip it
but
yeah yeah
so
somewhat
it's somewhat
created for you guys
but
as well
it's
it's
not
so
I appreciate it
all right
I need another snack
more snack
lots of
lots of snacks
more snack
more snack
yeah
I can't make particular use of any of that
I'm gonna take the poison
because I might use that on my arrows
unless one of you guys wanted to put on your sword
or axe
which one
the violet venom
yeah but other than that
like the bottle's good but
I just
I'm not good at throwing
right
yeah bottle
the bottle of lightning
yeah
yeah yeah
like it's real good
I'm just not good at throwing
I mean
you can practice
it could be worth trying to use
because
it's not gonna sell for much
so
I don't know
Jason
do you want me to take that
I'm going to
wind up
with
just a single action
tossing that thing
might be a pretty decent idea
yeah
oh you have a thunderstone
as well
Jason
seem to remember
somebody has a thunderstone
yeah
I've got it
yeah
that's true
boomstone
so yeah
yes I don't
you know
Clark your snacks
make me want a snack
Clark keeps on talking about snacks
and now Ramsey's out there
all right
why you do this
I don't believe you
but
but that is
that is good point
Ramsey
like
Jason
if you have a spare one action
and you're trying to
search for damage
these guys are perfect
perfect things that you could run with
like just throw the thunderstone
or throw the ball of lightning
or something
okay
Ramsey already has one of his
built-in things
because he uses his short bow
to shoot things
but
yep
if I haven't done it in a while
likely won't
but
you never know
yeah
okay
so
what are you guys doing
in the camp
let's blow it up
why
yeah
okay you blow up the camp
no
why are we blowing up the camp
there's gunpowder
we need to
just throw all the barrels
on the fire
boom boom
get our frog friend
from being
executed
yeah
for his
ritual
impurity
who
I imagine
we believe
is inside the cave
or
I assume
yeah
yeah
yeah
that's my assumption
yeah
it's an assumption
that is the one
I'm hearing
there is an ominous glow
coming from that cavern
so
one would assume
the ominous glows
and dead frogs
kind of have a tendency
to go together
yeah
at least at this point
at this point
um
it wouldn't hurt
not that it's necessary
but it wouldn't hurt
if
someone's got
you know
like a lay on hand
sort of thing
oh
somebody
somebody's hurt
somebody got hit
for 30 points of damage
when they've got
50 damage
kahir took some damage
he probably should be
healed up
since
yeah
he's
kind of
frontline tank
I wouldn't worry
about anybody else
I could use
some
down to 69
points
oh my gosh
I'm down
to 69
is that like
half your hit points
there
yeah
no
oh okay
I mean
Jason
you have some
pretty good
hit points
though
yeah
not compared to
everybody else
in the group
but
or sorcerer
with 50
hit points
that's huge
yeah
yeah
no I
like
I'm
astounded
at the amount
of damage
that I
have
been able
to take
and walk
away from
block it
with your
face
I'm really
good at
that
I really
do need
a game
where the
reverse numbers
are the
are the
good ones
you know
right
well
yeah
well
I mean
never know
you might
you might
fall in love
with Nimble
this week
or this
upcoming
weekend
or
there is
always
the
um
um
um
hmm
hmm
is it
cross
steel
both of
those ones
you always
hit
it's just
how hard
you hit
well
Nimble
you don't
always hit
you can
still roll
a one
and miss
but otherwise
you hit
so
oh
um
okay
so
let's see
what's going
on here
um
I am
going to
you know
dance around
the fire
okay
I've got
nothing else
down here
did um
someone else
scoop up
the stuff
that we're
just selling
I did
now
before we
forget about
it
all right
oh
I think
I got
space
I can
take it
one
two
three
all right
and you got
the bottle
right Jason
so that's
everything
yeah I got
the bottle
all right
um
so we
just need
to heal
up um
I don't
know enough
how to
use this
gunpowder so
I'm not
gonna bother
with it
but
not for
now
all right
so
Karsten
are you
gonna lay
on hands
people or
medicine
people or
battle
well you
don't need
a battle
medicine
but
you probably
could have
battled
medicine
Samir a
little bit
yeah who
do I need
to do that
to and I
will do it
uh well
Samir is
looking pretty
hit pretty
hard hit
pretty hard
um here's
taken a
hit so he
might you
know he
might value
some healing
but he's
as the uh
as the thing
says he's
barely hurt
so yeah
just depends
he's uh
let's see
69 of
82 is
where um
I hear
is
I need
it badly
who's that
yeah
did I do
it
oh my gosh
what the
heck
I am not
concealed
I don't
know why
it's
oh I
had to
roll
I removed
your concealment
all right
um you know
what you
healed me
that's great
heal somebody
else we
don't have
like six
hours to
do this
and I
think
that's
that's
fair
right
we do
have some
healing
stuff
right
uh
did
everybody
get this
this herb
stuff
I thought
I remembered
I have
one in
my pack
but
I only
want to
answer
this
I don't
have six
hours but
Jason
you have
a little
bit
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
oh
yeah
if I
had
anything
and I
don't
really
I thought
I had
something
but I
don't
yeah
we don't
know how
much time
our
froggy
friend
has
right
it is
pretty
time
sensitive
at this
point
so
anything
that you
can do
to heal
up real
quick
you do
want
like I
would say
Carson
definitely
does need
the 10
minutes
to
refocus
um
you could
do
like
um
but
you're
you're
definitely
wanting to
you know
get
get things
squared away
within the
next like
um
20
20
minutes
um
or
however
quickly
you want
to do
it
but yeah
time is
on the
time is
not on
your side
in a
specific
situation
yep
all right
cool
uh
well
I've got
these uh
these herbs
I forget
where I've
got them
from
uh
Samir
but
oh
you're
welcome
to
them
they'll
heal
you for
2d8
how do
I get
them
um
I
drop
them in
the chat
I think
yeah
maybe
can I
just
use
them
on
Samir
oh
uh
well
they're
gone
now
I pushed
use
I don't
know
um
they
were
2d8
right
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
so
Jason
uh
why don't
you just
go ahead
and click
on the
little
d8
at the
in the
chat
thing
twice
um
and
okay
so you
heal
five
of
that
okay
yeah
even
if
I
rolled
it
it
wouldn't
have
been
much
better
well
more than
half
so
okay
next time
okay
do you
guys have
any uh
any potions
or anything
at this
point
I don't
know who's
still got
potions
I got
potions
I think
I got
potions
one
you guys
I mean
potions
will also
24
oh you
did twice
for me
yeah
oh
all right
I'll uh
okay
all right
so at
this point
everybody's
mostly
mostly healed
up
um
here did
you
how did
you get
healed
did Carson
heal you
oh
Carson
healed me
oh I
did
okay so
Carson
you're we're
looking at 30
minutes that
you spent
healing people
at this
point
that is
correct
um
all right
so the
the uh
the
eerie
the eerie
glow starts
getting more
intense
as you're
going through
and doing
your doing
doing your
healing and
refocusing
healing and
refocusing
healing and
refocusing
um
things are
looking pretty
uh
pretty insane
over there
you lit up
so
you finished
your 30
minutes um
does anybody
have anything
else they
want to do
while Carson
is going
through his
healing cycles
before you
jump into
the cave
or at least
i assume
you're jumping
into the cave
yeah
oh we gotta
go
um
i'll have
you're the
barrels of
dynamite
uh
pretty heavy
are you
why
why
why
do
i
i'm
wondering
about
rolling
them
down
in
there
rolling
them
into
the
cave
yeah
just
you know
maybe
just roll
one
down
in
there
and
you know
after we
we needed
to go
down
there
yeah
yeah
yeah
we do
so
you know
maybe take
one down
in there
well
if you
want to
if you
want to
kick one
into the
cave
and bring
it along
with you
you're
welcome
to do
so
i'm not
going to
stop you
we might
we might
need to
do
ritual
cleansing
when
we're
done
you
would
you
would
definitely
need
it
probably
wouldn't
be
something
that
Samir
would
be
doing
it
would
probably
be
something
that
Kahir
would
be
doing
i mean
these
are
full
full
barrels
of gun
powder
so
not
something
that
your
average
strength
person
would be
able
to
do
yeah
yeah
all right
well
you know
for now
we'll
we'll
go ahead
and
it could
be a
tactical
advantage
for
negotiations
you know
strop a
bomb to
your back
okay
well
if Kahir's
willing to
move
move a
barrel of
gunpowder
then
you know
and he
moves a
barrel of
gunpowder
brings it
along
at this
point
though
scott
if you
do
move
the
barrel
of
gunpowder
you
won't
be
able
to
be
carrying
your
axe
and
moving
the
gunpowder
at the
same
time
you'll
have to
basically
either
be
moving
one
or
the
other
so
you're
gonna
have
to
shake
your
axe
to
use
it
well
that's
a good
yeah
good
deal
all right
so you
guys
enter
into
the
cave
entering
into
the
cave
we
go
the
first
thing
that
you
notice
when
you
enter
into
the
cave
is
that
you
go in
and
you guys
have been
inside caves
you know
how caves
are
there's
ceiling
and
walls
and
stalactites
and
stalagmites
you walk
you walk
you walk
into this
cave
there are
none of
those
things
you
appear to
be walking
into
a
dark
grove
with
a
eerie
starlit
night
above you
there's
there's
a river
running
on the
side
as you
step in
it's almost
as if you
transported
yourself
into a
different
world
the
colors
are wrong
the
water
is purple
it's not
blue
the
leaves
are more
of a
nightshade
color
not
the
vibrant
green
that you
expect
out of
most
leaves
there's
just
a
kind
of
an
eerie
not
otherworldly
feel
about
this
specific
space
and
again
it
doesn't
look like
a cave
there's
a path
ahead of
you
on that
leads
more
towards
a
towards
what
looks
to be
a little
bit
of a
farmstead
a homestead
sort of
sort of
building
in the
distance
what do
you do
so the
light that
we were
seeing in
the cave
is the
ambient
environment
light of
this
other
world
correct
yeah
okay
if you
do look
behind you
you see
the portal
you see
the entrance
to the
cave
it's
there
and you
can see
outside of
the cave
and you
see
you know
you see
the
camp
that you
just
left
but
inside
the cave
you have
entered into
a completely
different
world
huh
that's
new
um
Elr just
looks around
with wide
eyes
and just
says
kind of
not quietly
but almost
to himself
but whoever's
listening
is like
don't
don't
don't eat
anything
I'm just
kind of
looking around
yeah
and
Elr
you
specifically
like this
um
as you
have a
little bit
of a
fae
background
this
place
feels
homey
to you
like
not like
oh
you're
home
but it's
like
yeah
yeah
you know
a little bit
it feels
familiar
right
yeah
yep
yep
yep
wheel
um
okay
I would
say
probably
the first
thing
is
people
something
has been
in and
out
of this
portal
um
start
looking
around
for
any
sign
of
tracks
or
trails
or
whatever
that
would
lead
us
in
the
direction
we
need
to
go
um
sure
and then
so you
looked around
any frog
feet
right
right
so you
use your
nature
craft
and you
basically
look around
try and
see if you
can find
tracks or
um
different
indications
um
and you
do
see
that like
this
this
this road
that's
heading
towards
this
pottage
um
or this
farmstead
or homestead
or however
you want
to say
it
um
does
appear
to have
a majority
of like
the foot
traffic
um
you see
um
so you
see
that
specifically
um
go ahead
and roll
me a
survival
check
um
really
i'm looking
for
dc15
or above
to give
you additional
detail
besides
that
oh look
at
that's a
great
roll
there we
go
uh
so
there are
a couple
there are a couple
of different
tracks that you're
able to
distinguish
one there
is
indeed
a
um
there
there are
um
webbed
feet
that you
that you
see
um
but it's
kind of
it's kind
of weird
it's like
the webbed
feet are
they don't
they weren't
walking under
their own
power
it's kind
of like
they're being
dragged
um
but you do
see like
webbed
imprints
from time
to time
along the
drag marks
um
you do
also see
a um
a set
of hooves
and
um
a number
of different
booted
feet
um
but those
feet aren't
large
they're
you know
smaller
smaller feet
um
not as
small as
our
but
um
not like
you know
military
boots
kind
of
thing
um
but
all the
tracks
seem to
be leading
up the
road
towards
the
farmstead
that looks
like the
way to
go then
i mean
bog foot
do you guys
start
traveling up
the road
um
yeah i was
gonna say
we're in
now
so
um
yeah
okay
i guess
you know
being
mindful
of
um
any
sentry
scouts
whatever
okay
um
so
go ahead
and roll
me a
um
roll me
a perception
as you're
kind of
keeping an
eye out
for
um
different
sentries
or
or scouts
or
or
um
different
things
um
again
looking for
a dc
15
is that
everyone
anybody
who cares
to look
like jason
specifically
called it
out
but um
if you're
like i
mean i
would also
be careful
go ahead
and roll
it
yeah i
would i
would be
looking
back to
normal
okay
oh man
wow
there's
something wrong
with his
stuff
i'm just
saying
because he's
got a slower
internet connection
slower
faster internet
equals higher
guy rules
what am i
here we go
um
you're
serious
no
um
rollin
um
rule of
perception
oh
perception
okay
yep
it won't
let me
roll a
perception
um
if
you
um
on the
little
hud
thing
um
if you
click
on the
little
eyeball
um
in there
that'll
roll
your
perception
oh
well that's
silly
why can't
i do it
the other
way
i don't
know
all right
i mean
i do
have a
um
i don't
know
how
important
uh
is this
role
chris
um
i'm gonna
give it
a shot
too
i'm usually
searching
around
yeah
that
figures
actually
i'm not
doing so
well
that
yeah
none of
us
here
except
for
here
by the
sites
yeah
yeah
yeah
and and
that's
kind of
like one
of the
one of
the
situations
everything
here
is kind
of
familiar
but not
right
so
it's
something
that
looks
like
it
should
but at
the
same
time
it
doesn't
um
it's
the wrong
color
it's
the wrong
shape
it's
you know
similar
but not
the right
thing
uh
so
basically
um
all of
you besides
get here
aren't
really
able
to
um
aren't
really
able
to
take
in
anything
other
than
just
the
strangeness
of
the
of
the
space
um
get here
you
um
are
able
to
see
like
you
see
things
that
might
be
looking
at
you
they
might
not
be
like
you
see
a
murder
of
crows
that
you
know
that
as
you're
walking
up
the
path
that
kind
of
look
like
they
might
be
looking
at
you
and
then
they
fly
off
as if
they
didn't
have
a care
in
the
world
um
you
see
different
wildlife
that
appears
to
be
paying
attention
to
you
um
but
in
all
of
these
situations
it's
not
one
of
those
things
where
you're
like
well
these
are
sentries
it's
like
it's
possible
that
you
are
as
strange
to
them
as
they
are
to
you
right
so
it's
possible
that
they
are
sentries
for
whatever
you're
fighting
here
the
hag
you
see
as
you
get
closer
you
are
able
to
kind
of
get
a
distinction
or
kind
of
get
a
look
there's
a
final
bend
before
you
get
to
the
hut
and
when
you
get
to
about
that
space
you
are
go
ahead
go
ahead
and
roll
some
stealth
checks
for
me
I'm
assuming
that
you're
proceeding
with
care
and
not
wanting
to
actually
like
reveal
yourselves
and that
kind of
thing
they aren't
specifically
looking for
you so
it's not
going to be
a very
high DC
pretty much
as long
as you
don't
roll
like under
five
we should
be good
or I
could roll
another
one
Jason
you're
killing
me
two in
a row
are you
serious
oh
I'm
I'm
playing
my
character
entirely
wrong
apparently
I'm
a
blind
what am
I rolling
again
stealth
yeah
that's
what I'll
be a
blind
drunk
wizard
you know
there's a
literary
character
that I
think
Samir
fits
perfectly
for
only
he's
an old
man
an old
human
man
and his
name
is
Fizban
I believe
that you
are playing
Fizban
I do not
I do not
know this
character
he's
he's
dragon
lance
a dragon
lance
character
he's
basically
a
bumbling
wizard
like
completely
messes up
on everything
but
for him
it's
intentional
because he's
secretly a
deity
but you
know
you could
be
you could
be
playing that
up as
well
all right
so you
guys get
around to
the
around to
the
edge
there
and
you are
able to
gain sight
of kind
of what's
happening
so I'm
going to
go ahead
and switch
you guys
over to
the
next
hut
or the
next
battle
map
here
so to
the north
there are
three
figures
that you
see
and they
all
look
slightly
different
so I'm
just going
to show
you
there's
one that
looks like
a young
woman
with
very long
claws
and
a
bloody
dress
and
there's
one that
looks like
an old
an old
green
woman
with
warts
and a
humpback
and
just
a lot
of
a lot
of
ugly
I guess
is the best
way to put
it
so
straggly
gray
hair
it's not
even apparent
that she
has
eyeballs
she
kind of
walks
around
on all
fours
her hump
basically
forces her
upper
torso
down to
the ground
very
very
very
I don't
know
like
ugly
really hard
to
really hard
to even
kind of
take her
in
and the
last
is
actually
one that
Samir
you
recognize
because
you saw
her in
your
mirror
oh
oh
yeah
yeah
um
this
is the
this is
the hag
that you
recognize
as
Velcro
you had
a
there was
a name
that
that name
had popped
in
um
as part
of that
uh
she is
on the
uh
she's on
the top
of the
stairwell
um
so
the two
others
are around
a cauldron
in kind
of an
area
in front
of the
um
and
they are
um
working
on some
sort of
some sort
of
witch's
brew
um
they don't
see us
well
we're
we're
getting
there
somebody
rolled a
one
on their
stealth
check
so
they saw
me
he
doesn't
flopping
around
on the
ground
hi guys
I'm
here
so
you
so
basically
um
I
I'd
say
that
Samir
when
you
see
Velcro
that
you're
the
only
one
who's
actually
seen
her
you
see
her
and
there's
just
this
um
this
fear
that
kind
of
rises
up
within
you
um
which
causes
you
to
break
your
silence
um
I don't
know how
that would
how that
how Samir
would do
that
if he
would
scream
if he
would do
something
else
but like
how
how would
he
how would
he break
um
in character
how would
he break
his
trying to
sneak
by seeing
something so
horrendous
that it's
just like
you can't
control
yourself
there's
just
a reaction
that you
have
that is
loud
any ideas
um
i mean i can
say they
screams like a
little girl
but you know
that might not
be Samir
um
yeah
i don't
um
yeah
i think it
would probably
be more
of a
like
i think
would be
like
that's
her
oh my god
that's her
with
you know
maybe like
uh
a step
back
or a step
sideways
or just
a
a
misstep
that would
um
uh
you know
cause him
to
step on
a branch
or
you know
you know
i don't know
snap a
snap a twig
or something
on a tree
or whatever
and you know
the crack
would be the
thing that
you'd probably
hear
so it's
so it's
more like
a situation
where you're
like keeping
yourself contained
but you're
so freaked
out that
you're not
paying as
much of
attention
about where
you're
going
and you
basically
you know
knock something
over
yeah
fumble
into something
and i
don't know
maybe i
trip over
a stump
and you
know
splay myself
out on the
ground
i don't know
yeah
noticeable
audible
okay
um
all right
so so
they were
focusing on
their witch's
brew at
that point
um but
like as
you guys
get to
get around
the bend
um
samir
basically
kind of
like
kicks a
rock
and it
just kind
of
goes
into the
river
and makes
a you
know makes
a loud
a loud
splashing
sound
um which
gained the
attention of
the witches
um in there
and with that
i i gotta i
gotta step
away for a
sec um so
i'll be back
in
um so
sorry about
that
no worries
um
so
my thought
here
is
um
they know
i'm here
if we can
play off
it they
don't know
that you're
here
maybe you
guys can
sneak around
while i
persist in
the
um
distraction
and uh
you know
maybe
draw their
attention so
that they're
not looking
elsewhere
yeah
yeah maybe
i mean
there's a
good chance
like
that they're
going to see
us at all
but yeah
if not
then yes
that sounds
great
yeah i
don't have
another way
to play
any of
that to
my
our
advantage
and i
clearly have
no advantage
so
yeah yeah
yeah yeah
yeah i don't
know
i don't see
our froggy
friend either
there are
frogs but
i don't think
any of them
are the
one we're
looking for
right
there is a
big old
chonking
horse-sized
frog though
he looks
yeah
yeah
he does
uh
i'm
content to
think that
he might
be a
problem
oh
maybe
he's part
of the
he's part
of the
landscape
so
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
but
excuse me
excuse me
i don't
have a
better
suggestion
what are
these green
things floating
around me
kirsten
kirsten
uh
i don't
know
it's a
good question
i don't
know
they've
been floating
around
all
evening
yeah
so i'm
uh
sorry
like i
don't i
don't know
i don't
have a
solution
here
yeah
i'll be
sorry
dude
i mean
i just
kind of
keep
screwing
everything
up for
everybody
it's like
dude
i
this is
making it
much more
difficult
for all
of us
than it
needs to
be
nah
this was
inevitable
we're just
uh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
all right
well chris
is off
i'm gonna
step away
and take
care of
a couple
things and
i'll be
back
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
oh
it's not
quite big
enough
oops
babe
okay
i
i
i
i
to
i
om
i
i
i
i
i
i
i
i
i
i
i
.
.
.
I'm going to fall asleep.
.
Right?
I'm already falling asleep twice tonight.
Oh, that's no good.
For the game.
Right?
All right, I'm back.
Sorry, guys.
No worries.
Oops.
Okay.
Okay, so you see the three witches.
Samir kicks a stone into the river.
And the two that are closest, the green hag, which is the one that looks like the old lady.
The hunchbacked old lady, which is here, and the blood hag, which looks like the young lady over there.
They're both, they were having a conversation, but they cut it off really quickly.
And one of them says, what was that, and they kind of look in the general direction of the river.
They haven't spotted you yet, but it's a matter of time they are aware of your presence.
So at this point, like, you all kind of freeze, and we're pretty sure that the next time you start moving, they, you know, there will at least be some understanding of where you are.
So effectively what that stealth role did was it made it so that you weren't able to get closer to them before any sort of combat might initiate.
Yep.
So you're just a little bit further out.
All righty.
Jason had to step away, Chris.
You missed that part.
Oh, okay.
I'm back.
Oh.
Never tell.
I'm back.
Let's go see what kind of powers they got.
All right.
All right.
So effectively we're in combat, Chris.
Yeah.
You're basically, you're, you're in a space of like, you're not, you haven't started initiative, but like, at this point, I'm expecting you guys to declare what your, what your initial reactions are going to be.
And then you're going to be, um, basically running in initiative order at that point.
So, okay.
I mean, I could just start initiative right now and just call it good.
I'm, I'm ready to kill the evil.
We are still a good ways off.
And there's a, uh, anyway, um, all right.
Jesus priest.
Yeah.
Ah, excellent.
Excellent.
Um, I think I'm stuck on two.
Oh, you guys are doing great.
I'm stuck on one.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Two.
It wasn't good.
I was going to say, you know, I'm, I've kind of made the distraction and, uh, all that good jazz.
Um, maybe I continue to be a distracting presence.
It's while these guys sneak off in a different direction.
I mean, I don't know if we're really going to move anywhere.
Also, I don't even see where they are on the map.
They're way up.
Way up north.
Oh.
Oh, way up there.
Holy cow.
Yeah, we're, we're a long ways off.
That's pretty impressive that they heard us from way up there.
Well, they are magical beings, so.
And, to be fair, Samir rolled a one.
So.
Which is like a critical fail.
Right.
Chris, are my gadget, or, yeah, gadget, skates, I can just activate them, right?
Um, let me see here.
First, you need to roll.
You're using a roll initiative.
Oh.
Well.
I'd like to use those, because I'm going to be as slow as molasses here.
You're just as fast as everybody else.
That's what she says.
It's actually the truth.
Um, you've got the apothecary's medicinal herbs as well.
I do?
Yeah.
I don't know what that means, but okay.
Um, so your gadget, skates, um.
I'm going to go, go, gadget, go.
Uh, moving twice your speed during movement, you must succeed at a DC 20 acrobatics check.
Ooh.
Um, turn 90 degrees.
You can turn more than once at 90 degrees during activation.
And after the activation completed, you can stride, step, or otherwise move on the ground
until the end of your next turn.
So it's one action, and it doubles your movement for one round.
I believe it's a consumable, so once you've used it, it's gone.
But yeah, you could use those.
But you still need to roll initiative.
Are you talking to everyone, or just me?
Uh, you.
You're the only one who hasn't rolled initiative yet.
Well, what?
What is going on with that?
Yeah, all the talking, and everyone's leaving, I'm not understanding.
I'm sucking, too.
You're right there with everybody else.
Apparently, the, uh, the hags are, um.
Very perceptive.
Very, uh, are definitely on the, on the win here.
Uh, so we will go ahead and start.
Okay.
This one.
It's about 100 feet out.
Okay.
How do we even, we're so far away.
Okay.
So, she is gonna just,
move
behind the rocks.
And you're gonna wait.
And you're gonna wait.
Okay.
Okay.
The green hag is going to
suddenly
disappear.
Robiness.
Robiness.
Robiness.
Robiness.
Robiness.
Robiness.
Robiness.
Robiness.
Robiness.
Robiness.
On the visage.
Robiness.
Robiness.
Robiness.
Robiness.
Robiness.
And you're gonna be
gonna wait.
Robiness.
Robiness.
Coryess.
What if, like?
Well, I know the others will be
who is gonna一 minute ahead and
30 feet away.
Yeah.
That's a persistent reality.
Velcro's going to move
back into
the cabin a bit.
What the heck?
And now we are
Carson.
I really don't know what to do.
Everyone just disappeared.
I'm going to use my skates of awesomeness.
I'm going to run like
Mays.
What was that?
That was me.
Oh.
So I go to inventory.
How do I activate my skates of
awesomeness?
If you
click on it, there will be a use
button. Just click on use.
Click on it.
Oh.
All right.
All right.
Now what?
Now your speed
is doubled, so you
can move 60 feet for one
action.
I thought I had to do a DC20.
That's only if you
make a 90 degree turn.
Oh.
I'm so confused.
I can't move my guy either.
Oh, there he is.
Yes, I can.
I lied.
Wasn't working, I promise.
There are walls
that there are walls in here
that you're going to have to
kind of
I have no idea where the
walls are.
I do it.
I'm okay.
Well, as long as you've moved,
as long as you can move through it,
you, there aren't walls.
Oh, okay.
Like the walls will just
prevent you from moving.
All right.
My concern is I'm going to get
there and I'm going to get
walloped, but
well.
Oh, that's a hundred feet.
Yeah, you can't do a hundred feet.
You can only do 60 for one
action.
I know, but that is where
you currently are.
I can move a hundred and
then you can move again.
Chris.
It's counting from when I
started.
Yeah.
So your one action was,
was going that 60 feet.
Your next action.
It's 120.
Yeah.
Let me, let me check the
gadget skates because it
might just be for one
move.
Oh,
but it might actually work
exactly the way that you're
thinking it would do.
So I just gates.
You activate the gadget
skates.
Clockwork gears reveal
wheels along the ground,
moving up to twice your
speed.
During this movement,
you must succeed at,
to make any turn up to
90 degrees.
Yeah.
So it's a one use thing.
So you basically use it as
an action and then you move
twice your speed.
So in order to be able to,
your,
your next action of movement
would only be another 30
feet.
It wouldn't be another 60
feet.
Oh,
okay.
Which you can still move.
It just be 30.
So get you up to 90.
Sure.
And then I can use my last
action to,
uh,
wait a minute,
wait a minute,
wait a minute.
that's 20.
Okay.
I'm going to move there and
hide behind these rocks and
put up my shield.
Um,
actually that you let,
let's see.
Wanted to do one.
What are you thinking about
doing a sudden charge?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
And you can't,
you can't get to her even
with that one 20,
right?
Uh,
no,
I don't think so.
Oh,
I,
I miss her by five feet.
Yeah.
You're okay.
Okay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Unfortunately.
Yeah.
Okay.
Do I have to raise my shield?
Uh,
yeah.
So on your,
on your character sheet,
there's a,
well,
well,
stop,
stop killing people.
It's on my action menu,
right?
Uh,
yeah,
it should be on your action menu.
Um,
on the,
in the shield entry,
there should be a raise option.
Uh,
breaking spike shield,
right?
No,
I don't see it.
Strike damage.
Sheath.
Sheath.
Yeah.
I don't see it on there either.
Um,
that's weird,
right?
Had it.
Yeah.
There,
there might be some,
might be something going on.
All right.
Well,
I raise it.
So here we go.
So we just need to make sure that,
um,
of a 24 AC,
not 22.
Okay.
to add modifier.
add modifier
all right so i added a shield um i had a shield modifier on you so
um we have the appropriate um thing all right samir you're up
well i'll do the uh thing that i can do which is
attack the visible chick
um i did the wellspring i guess i i'm not 100 sure how to do the wellspring thing
um well i mean really at this point yeah you um because of your wellspring mage dedication you
just get to pick a spell slot that you refresh um
like if if you weren't um if if you didn't have your wellspring mage mage dedication
it requires a role but i don't think it requires a role for your dedication i think you just
okay um all right so anyway um
so i'm going to do the thunder strike i am going to um
use my
beat
dangerous for three
um
status it grants a status bonus to the spell's damage equal to the spell's rank so it's like
plus one yay um but anyway so i'm going to do that
and i believe that doing the
in doing defeat and then casting the spell
would use all three of my actions correct correct yeah yeah
um so she does save um with a 25 but that just means that's having damage so go ahead and roll your damage
not bad i've done worse by a lot
um so she will go ahead and take six damage
that
and i guess then ends my turn
all right
well i softened her up guys i softened her up
did you hit
oh
how deep does this river
walk
um
it's uh
it's definitely something that if you're not careful
um
would kind of sweep you away
perfect
but it's not so deep that you'd be
okay
all right
sounds good
not something i want to mess with
all right
well
oh
i suppose
there's
there's not a whole lot
to do here
yeah i'm gonna have to keep up
so i think we just move
um
maybe
yeah nope
that's just gonna be it
uh
so we need to get up there
so all right
uh
we're gonna move
where can i get
not great but as i see karsten just
skate off into the distance
uh
yeah i guess i just waddle after him
that's that's my whole turn
that's all we got
see i need to be up with uh
at least near you guys
to be able to do much of anything
so
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
that's me
all right
see here get up there
you only moved 75
i'm all in the back
oh yeah and that is your fault
all right
yeah
here's the back line
here
you're up
yes i'm walking up
that's one move
hey welcome how you doing buddy
thanks join me
all right
can i do the math so i can get there
well and if you notice it actually counts your it actually counts your actions too
like if you look at the distance oh i didn't know it'll let you know when you've hit the
oh you've hit the end of your movement
yeah i just noticed that earlier today so it must be a newer feature
why are you going there you're going to get blasted hide behind the rock
i can't see you
i'm behind you
how would you do that
you got better so you can get hit instead of him
i can't even see the rock because i'm so far zoomed out
i don't know all kinds of
can we go into these dark spaces
looks like it
we have to stay on the path
you don't have to stay on the path you can
move outside of the path if you want to the path was just leading to the house you found the house so
um
i found a secret world
also where's the green frog guy did i miss something
okay go there it looks like he's swimming in a pot right now oh did he take the other guy back go there and then go to bed oh don't say that they might take you up on that
well it is 10 o'clock so
we we are at we are at betty by the time as is
that was the end of the round so that's pretty perfect
it was the end of the round so yeah we can we can just call it here tonight um
because yeah i mean if we do want to do this come like this is
this is the ball i need to be done uh-huh so um this won't go take a minute
could potentially take a while so yeah where it might be really quick and really bad for everybody
you know that's always a five could be a five minute swing in the opposite direction of what we want
um but yeah this is the this is the boss fight so um imagine it'll take a bit so we'll go ahead and
call it for tonight and pick it up uh weeks from now
yeah sounds awesome you guys have a good night everybody
all right
all right yeah i'm heading out too
all right i'm back to work
yeah getting up early single digits
yeah
i feel i feel pretty good
i feel pretty good about my situation i at least for the next six months i get to
uh work from home primarily so
oh nice uh yeah they're renovating the
uh corporate office so
