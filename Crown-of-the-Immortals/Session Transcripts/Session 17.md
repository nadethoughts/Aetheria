I'm very impressed. Yeah. And, well, and just to just kind of, you know, add some more to that, like, you've never heard of a giant turtle like this. You are fairly certain that you are at least close to Lobopolis, if not in Lobopolis proper. Her giant sea turtles don't just pop up anywhere.

So this is very odd. You know? Even even amidst all the weirdness, this is especially weird. Yeah. Oh, alright.

I'll agree. So, anybody else have anything else that they want to share about their character's, reaction as you guys follow, Prince Troubadour on the staircase? Oh, no. Not really. I think, Elwar, kinda similarly, is just kind of taking it all in.

Like, wow. This place is great. Just, yeah, just wondrous rock. This is what he was for. Seeing if I did new stuff.

Yep. Alright. So you make it up the first the first stone case in or stone staircase, and you do notice that, around the, outside of the turtle shell, there is a stone wall. So this is a walled city, and it is a multi tiered city as well. Well, city being a, a loose term.

So this is definitely, I mean, it's a giant hurdle, but it's a small town. Right. It's basically kind of where that lands. But there are three different, there are three different layers or, aspects of not aspects, platforms of the city. So you're in the you're in the lower, the lower, I keep on when I say pier, but it's not pier, tier of the of the city.

There's a second tier that, is right in right above you. Is definitely not built for, defenses, but there is a giant statue of Ulvara in the center of that, in the center of that tier. And then there's a third tier, which, has some sort of imminent glow glow, or some sort of greenish glow radiating out from it. A number of the a number of the villagers and, you know, tribes people walk out and they, they see Prince Troubadour. Another oddity that you see based off of your interactions with Prince Troubadour, you would expect its people to be more militaristic or more or have, like, more, like, proper clothing sort of thing.

Although his is piecemeal, it it was put together in such a way that it was just more of a typical fantasy sort of clothing that he wears. Everybody else here has more of a tribal, Aztechie kind of look to them. Okay. So the the oddity is that nobody looks like he does, but, clearly, he belongs to these people. Uh-huh.

Yep. Like, he is the oddity. I do. So they there are a number of people that walk up to him, and, you know, they're all very excited to see him, here amongst the amongst the jammering and and chatting, that his that his father, other chief Crokmar, has been worried about him. He's apparently been gone for a long time.

That was not the impression that he gave you, Mhmm. But that but that is that is what they, that that's kind of what you're picking up is, like, he just kinda disappeared a while ago, and they didn't and and they don't know they didn't know what happened. Of course. Mundane detail. After a bit of time, like, there are you you see a few runners run out, run out, and after about four or five minutes of this kind of chattering and things while you guys are kind of keeping your distance, but, you know, also kinda listening in and that kind of thing, you do see a, an old frog, walking around the edge of the shell, towards, towards the party.

He's not decrepit by any stretch of the imagination. He's very he carries himself regally, and he definitely has is still hustled and and and well able. But he but he does he is definitely one of the people that or a very well respected person in the, in the community. And he comes walking around. And when he gets the point where he sees, Prince Troubadour, he shouts out, shouts out, Baquin, I'm so glad you've I'm so glad you made it back, and comes running over to him and embraces him.

After a few moments, distributor, pulls himself away from his father and turns to the group and says, I have brought allies to our cause. These are, what do you call yourselves again? I don't know what we call ourselves. Right. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. But we don't really have a group name, do we, guys? Shocking. We we don't.

We're from That's the city. That's it. So we could be the city. Whatever. I forgot the city.

Yep. However the city is. From Aotan or something like that. Yeah. The group from Aotan.

Yep. We are fellow survivors of the retribution like yourselves. Well, well met. I see that you only bring Baguan with you, but of the others that traveled with him, that Boguen or at that, prince Troubadour, lowers his head in in, in sadness. He says they did not make it.

There were more, there were more undead than we had originally thought, father. And with that, the the chieftain, also, lowers his head, and says, may Bavari keep them, and may their hunt be long. Then he turns to you and says, well, I must, I must thank you, for delivering my son back here. Is there any boon that you would wish of the, Gamarzul? What's a boon?

Boon. Mhmm. Like, it's Reward bonus. Award. Yeah.

Yeah. Yep. I would love a hot meal and some rest, your majesty or lordship or king or whatever. In indeed. Also, we came to these lands on a mission.

We would like to speak with you once you have the time. I I think we can help each other once again as your son and us already have. I would be intrigued to hear your proposal. In the meantime, if food and shelter is what you desire, we have plenty of both. Please come and, enjoy our hospitality as thanks for returning our intrepid, our intrepid boy.

And with that, like, there's you know, it is around dinner time, so they they already have stuff stuff going, but then they also kind of add a little bit more to it, turn what was supposed to be just a regular, a regular meal into more of a feast. They have a number of different delicacies that are available. Some of them are things that don't necessarily look all that appetizing to you. Mhmm. But there are also a number of other things, that seem more like they're your fare.

Another oddity with this with these people is they seem to have things that like, they they've made food that looks very similar to stuff that you would expect, like, from, from our like, you know, from your people. They have, like, gnomesque food. They have elvenesque food. They're awesome upstairs then. Correct.

And and human and human food as well. Maybe that. But, but they also have other things from other cultures. It's kind of like a amalgamation of a bunch of different cultures, that that they have. And, some of the stuff that doesn't look so good, if you if you are brave enough to try it, it actually ends up being very tasty.

Some of the stuff that some of the stuff does not end up being very tasty. But it's really kind of one of those things where you have to risk it for the biscuit. Mhmm. Absolutely. Elwar tries everything, especially the things he's not had before.

Carson does not. He sticks to the things that, are more human esque. Pepperoni pizza hamburgers. Right. That's right.

Absolutely. And shrimp, maybe some lobster if it's there. Crawfish. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

They they have a number of different things that are this world's equivalent of those of those of those sorts of things. After, as the as the meal goes on, you do there are a few other, a few other do you other, here we go. VTTs are very awesome, but at the same time, they're not so awesome. Mhmm. Mhmm.

So that is, what what we're currently on the game table, it's called a VGP. Yep. Yep. So that is chief Croakmar. You do also meet, his wife, his lady Lilypad Lady Lilypad.

That's not me. And his daughter, who acts as an adviser to him. She's kind of like a like an adviser. And she is for real Forella, Greenleaf. Something that you do when when kind of talking around that there is a a fifth member of the Greenleaf family, the eldest brother.

And he, his name is Toadwin, and he is not present. And, prince Troubadour is specifically looking for him and is kind of, little bit despondent when he finds out that Codewin is not there. The general story in the scuttlebutt is after prince Troubadour, disappeared, then, Toadwin went looking for him, and he has not returned yet. Do they really function like a monarchy here? It's more of it's less of a well, kind kind of.

Yeah. I mean, it's it's more of a, it's more of a tribal, chieftain sort of thing. Okay. But it is kind of like, Todwyn, as the as the eldest as the eldest born, is expected to be the heir of the tribe, that kind of the heir of the chief of the chiefdom of the tribe. And he's apparently a very capable warrior, second only, to, chieftain Crokmar himself.

Oh. Alright. So dinner happens. You guys enjoy all of the all of the food that you're able to, scarf down. Your bellies have not been this full in a great many years, or maybe not a great many years, but a great many days.

I wouldn't necessarily say years, but, and, after that, chieftain Krogmar, invites you into his, not a hut, but his his living quarters, which is a well, it's it's this building right here. Okay. So, to have a, to have a after dinner chat. Yeah. He does include, his his daughter, Aurella, but lady Lilypad, herself from the conversation.

And Prince Trudeau is also invited, to be be a part of the council. Upon entering the building, it it is a very, it it's a stone building, and it does have, a hearth and a fire and and those sorts of things, although they are not currently active, as you're currently sitting in a boiling lake, where. But, it does have more of a more of a classical, middle, medieval style style to it, with more, with more of, like, like, the tapestries are more like Aztec in style. So it's those, you know, square patterns and and geometric shapes and that kind of thing. Mhmm.

Right. So he, so he pulls you in. He has you sit at a table with him, and he says, so you mentioned something about an alliance, a mutually beneficial situation? Yes. Yes.

Yes. We, we originally came to these lands. Our home has been attacked by, goblins, specifically those from the, burning burning tree burning what is it, Chris? Sorry. Oh, the Firewalker tribe.

Ah, the Firewalker tribe. After speaking with your, your son here on our travels, we hear that they have, been a bother to you as well. So we hope to at least get some information that may help us. If not, maybe a a joint campaign against them. Where we come from, we are quite the warriors ourselves.

We took down many goblins on our way here. Well, the, stories that, that Bogwan has told me are half as true as as what he said, then I would venture to say that you probably are, very well capable. I would say, as far as the fire walkers are concerned, where we their location, we can point you in a general direction. We have not been successful in finding their actual encampment or village or whatever it is that they live in primarily because there's some sort of magic that we don't quite understand that is preventing us from doing so. Our scouting our scouting parties either return thinking that they were heading, that they were heading deeper into the jungle and ending up on the edge of the jungle where, where we are or a, never never return.

We have no we we know where they are not, which means we know where they are, but we can't get to them. I see. Well, with that, we also brought something that may help. We captured one of these goblins on the shore. I believe he is likely within your people's custody at the moment when he was brought from the from our boat.

Yes. Yes. We do have him, we do have him in, in our jail, and we will definitely to hear what he would have to say. Mhmm. So I think that I can like like I said, I can can point you in a general direction.

But if you're interested in killing goblins, they attack us on a fairly regular basis. There are, I don't know why they feel inclined to travel across the boiling sea to come and fight us, but they seem to do so on a very on a very regular basis. I can't say it's like clockwork, but, it is something that happens pretty consistently. Oh, it's rather foolish. This this place is quite defensible.

Yes. It it is. And thus far, they have not been able to break our defenses, although they have tried pretty, desperately from time to time. But Oloroo keeps us safe. Can you tell us any more about Oloroo?

Oloroo is Oloroo. What what do you want to know? How did he come to be? How did you come to be on this giant tortoise? Does he move?

Do you guys stay here? You know? General question. Yes. He he does he does move, as as it turns out.

I believe the raining fire, fired him out a little bit. Uluru was a that seems so impersonal to call him a gift, but it was a divine boon that was given to us by Ulvara, many, many, generations ago. He's been our constant companion, keeping us safe and protecting us as we as we follow the hunt. As far as how he survived the raining fire, he it's something that even we did not know was something that he could do. Before the fire rained, he took flight and flew above the and flew flew above the flames.

What? And landed in this in this lake. And he has not shown too much gumption to do much of anything ever since. Believe that it is the belief of myself and our, and our best physicians and, Domen that he hired himself out and is simply resting. Do you communicate with him?

He does. We, yes. Communicate is the correct word. We do not have conversations, but we have lived with him, and he's lived with us for a great amount of time, and we know each other's habits. I see.

Was there, anything that you wished anything else you wish to know about Oluru? Nope. Not really. That seems to be I mean, that seems sufficient for me. Oh, you wanted to know where we we are not originally from this area.

We are actually from the, from the East. Oh. Southeast, to be completely, to be, honest. So there's a, we are in we we are from the sea. There are a number of islands that we, that that we migrate to and from and around.

Uluru obviously has been, as a sea turtle, we generally keep to the coast. We don't go too far inland. This is, in fact, the furthest inland that we've ever been. Makes sense. After looking through the ruins on the coast there, I think we've determined that, this place is actually where most of us came from, come to find out.

But we are now far to the north. Uh-huh. Do you know how or how how far to the north are you? It seems to be a very long if how how how far did you travel to make it down here? Well, I'm trying to find out those are two very different questions.

Right. Near near as we can tell. I think it is it would normally be several months journey. However, we were able to arrive, through some rather magical means that, still are a little mysterious to us. Is this how the, is are these magical means the way that the Firewalker tribe has, been attacking you, or is this a or is there a separate firewalker tribe that's, like, two related tribes?

Or Yeah. We we believe, that that they're using the same means. There is a a series of tunnels, a caves, that seem to magically connect here to where we come from, and they have, have used those to to get to us. I see. Our people do currently have them, secured, however.

So we don't anticipate more attacks, but we are here to make sure, well, that that stays permanent. Yeah. I see. Well, if, that that seems like a seems like a honorable hunt. Yeah.

We would be we would be happy to assist you any way we can, especially considering our combined, our combined enemy. You will forgive me, but I am not currently at a place where I can provide the best assistance, to you at the moment. My, eldest born, Codewin, is expected to return any anytime now. He's actually vouch three or four days later than we expected him. Oh.

But when he returns, then we can we can definitely provide the, provide a greater level of assistance. As this as Oloru is under attack consistently, we do not want to leave him undefended. Where did your son go? He went searching for Bogwan. Bogwan returned before he did.

Uh-oh. Okay. So if you are if you would be willing to wait around for a few days, get to know the get to know the people, get to know our people, and under and understand our, understand our ways a little bit, then, we would be most happy to assist you, in the extermination of these goblins. It may, in fact, take us a few days to, get any information from that, presence that you brought us anyway. And, we'll look at the the rest of the team.

Like, I I mean, we're not in a big hurry. I I think we can spare a few days. What do what do you think? I I also think it's wise to wait to hear what this prisoner has to say. It could be very valuable.

I agree as well. I agree. Alright. Is Kahir with us? Here.

Just listening. He here is thinking that he doesn't have an he doesn't have anything to swing an axe at. This sucks. That's not easy to go. That's right.

I'm worried about the other son, though. Where is he at? Mhmm. Mhmm. Go look for him, maybe.

Yep. Alright. I have to go. Well worth being concerned about. Yeah.

I, Sameer, I have no no reason to think that it's in our interest to to get out of here any anytime too too soon. Alright. So they will, they they'll set you up in, in your own quarters. I don't have a ton of extra rooms, but there are some cots and things that are available for, you. And it's and it's it's a private room.

It's private for you guys. They they make sure to give you them space so you have your own have your own area or your own space to be able to do whatever it is that you want. So, you've got a few cuts and that kind of thing. Anything that anybody specifically wants to do over the course of the next couple of days while, they're working stuff out? Oh, yeah.

Oh, yeah. I'm a take a boat real quick and go to the head of this giant turtle, Uluru, and I am going to try to see what happens, since as a gnome, I have the ability. Where is it? I am an animal elocutionist, and I can speak and have conversation with animals. Yes.

Of course. I'm not sure if this thing counts as an animal. It may not, but I don't cry because, of course, I am. You know? Not every day you get to talk to a millennial old turtle.

Exactly. Well, even if this wasn't an animal, that's that is as awesome of an idea as I've ever heard, so we'll go we are gonna go with it. So, so you row up to the, to the turtle. And, again, like, you you are kinda taken in by seeing the cosmos in the eyes of the of the turtle itself. But as you, as you approach, you how how does that work?

Is that you just have, like, speak with animals effectively? Or Yeah. Essentially. They hear animal sounds as conversations instead of unintelligible noise. Can respond and turn.

Right. Yep. Yep. So I just speak yeah. Essentially, I speak animals up constantly, essentially.

Perfect. So you, you you get over there, and Oloroo sees you coming, and, he gives you an interested yet inquisitive look. Mhmm. Kind of like, what's about to happen here? What is this thing?

You know? I kinda wave at him with a big smile, and I say, hello, friend. Hello there, small one. I can't hear you. This is fantastic.

I don't know if anyone else is in the boat with me and wanted to to to see this work. You'll be able to hear anything, but, you know, if you want to. Yes. I do want to. Yeah.

Yeah. That's why I'm in the wow. I I almost didn't expect this to work. My goodness. I, I I you are you are Uluru.

That that's your name. Right? Yes. That is what they call me. What do you call you?

Yes. Yes. If you if you ask that, he will give you a he will give you a a Gandalfian answer of I'm known by many names, but one that I go by most recently is Leroux. Oh, I see. Excellent.

Excellent. Well, I I have a lot of questions. I I know, you are very tired. I I do not wish to to wear out my my welcome with you. But but if you would, I would I would love to have a conversation.

I am I am up for a conversation. It is not so often that I am able to just chat with somebody. What would you like to talk about? Well, I guess I'm I'm very interested in you, your story. I imagine you are quite ancient.

You have, I'm sure, seen things that have passed from the memory of the rest of us. Where where did you come from? Are there are others like you? Do you know how old you are? I I am older than the ocean.

Oh. I am one of a kind. There are none there are none like me. I was created as a companion for the, technical words. I was created as a companion for the guiding luminescence, Ulvara.

I, sir, I traveled with him many years. He How is that so? Wow. He and I have seen worlds come and worlds go. These frog men that have, that I sit with or or that are that live on my back, did an especially, an especially loyal and kind thing for Ulvara.

And as a reward, and for for their protection, he asked me to look over them, And I have done so for the past five hundred years. Oh, wow. I doubt they even know what it was that they did, but I do not forget. And I've been with them long enough to know that should a need, they would not hesitate to do what they must in order to, in order to protect him. Indeed.

So you've wow. You you've met and spoke with and traveled with one of the one of the luminescences. Did did did did you meet any of the others? I have seen them and spoken with them, but when when interacting with a guiding luminescence, I would not say that I know them. Even Uvarra, I cannot fully say that I have knowledge of him.

But, yes, I have I have met and interacted with others. I see. We, survived, like the, I forget. We heard a name of the the race of fraud people. Right?

I'm just forgetting it right now. Trippke is the name of the race. Yep. Like like the Trippke, we we survived the the flaming retribution, the the fire from the sky. But, we we are, collectively, followers of Raythellian and his I I don't know if children's the right word, but the the the other luminescence is, specifically, I, was spoken, no, communicated to.

I was given a vision, by by what I believe was Cadence. I don't know if if you had the pleasure. We also have interacted with, not directly, but found a temple, of Shenandoah. Do you have experiences with either of these? Shenandoah is, more brilliant than I have than I have experience with.

I have, I have interacted with Cadence, although he does not always understand the ways of Ol'Vara, and they are not close. Yeah. That that that that makes sense, I suppose. I seek, I seek something of of his of Cadence. His song, The Yano.

Do you know of it? Do you know anything about it? I found but a snippet, a a a bar, maybe slightly more. Oh, yes. I do know it.

As a matter of fact, that is why I am here. Oh. And with that, he kind of looks looks down to the, well, down to the right. Mhmm. As you follow his gaze, you see under the under the boiling water, there there is the outline of a temple that is, surrounded by a number of, a number of brine sharks Oh.

Which should be a a picture of. Oh. Oh, yeah. They they they look cuddly. Mhmm.

He, Oloru says that is Aiden's temple Oh. Lost to time. Wow. And that is why you are here, you said? To protect it?

Yes. I was, as as the, flaming retribution came near, I was asked, by, Uvarra by way of well, Cadence, by by way of Uvarra to travel to this spot, to protect this from to protect this temple, what was inside, from any, from any, but from any, dark influences that we're trying to, get what was in what was in there. Oh, is is that why the goblins attack the fire walkers? Is that why they're coming here, do you think? I believe the little green men are here to, are are wishing to get gain access to that temple, but, we have been able to repel them, and we will continue to do so.

That is quite troubling. Where we come from, there is a, I I think I mentioned a temple to Shanonua, and the goblins are coming there as well, we believe, to try to gain access. And we have also so far been able to stop them. It's very interesting that all that the survive the two known survivors of this cataclysm both ended up in places where the temples of the the temples of the of the guiding luminescences and the and the, and the rank of brilliance deities are. Perhaps Raythellian is guiding us even further.

It would seem. Although, in our in our case, we did not let we did not come to where the temple was. The temple kinda came to us. But, yes, I I believe you are correct. But what what would you say if we wanted to gain access to the temple below?

Would that be something you would allow or maybe even help us with? The the Temple Of Shenandoah, requires repair. There's a a hourglass, that is broken. We believe that to repair it, we need to, find the right material and, the complete or at least more complete version of the auto. He looks he looks at you very intently.

And as he does, it appears as he's as if he's looking into your very soul. Oh. After a few minutes, he links and says, I think you must go down there. Well, I who who am I to say no? And I'm I'm kind of, like, translating back and forth this whole conversation.

I'm just not sitting there talking in turtle the whole time. Only one problem. And I kind of, like, put my hand a little bit above the water and shy back. I'm like, we can't survive that. Is is there any magic you know or know where we could find that could could help us?

That I that I do not have a I do not have knowledge of. You will have to figure out for yourself how to accomplish this task. But I do know that you are meant to go there. Oh, okay. And as and and as he says that, it it just kinda sparks you to look back down at the place.

And that that temple there's something familiar about that temple to you. And that applies to all four of you. If any of you look at that temple, like, it seems familiar to you. Can you make a, like, some kind of ALF check to see if we recognize it? Like, what specific no.

It it's it's kind of like one of those things that's, like, at the at the edge of your memory, but not really, not really something that you can actually, like, make a roll and It's a deja vu. Yeah. Yeah. It's a I think I've been there before kind of Sure. Sure.

Is familiar. Well, that was in Lemopolis. Maybe we passed by it and never knew what it was. Awesome. I I had, one more question.

Do you do you know what can you tell us of I'm gonna go to the bathroom. The, of the and I kind of, like, lower my voice even though I know no one can understand me or hear me, but I know it's taboo. So I lower my voice. What can you tell us about the La Paloo? You were alive when when they walked.

The stories say they are they are evil and corrupt. That is true for some. Most were faithful servants. They were not as, as those today believe, born in evil, but there were some that were corrupted by Everos and goes to follow his path rather than the light. And that is what that is what has caused such a, fear of them.

Because when you have such great power and he looks at you knowingly okay. When when you have such great power Uh-huh. Then it is difficult for those without to understand that you are you are fallible just like anyone else. Oh, that that makes sense. I I got a smile at him knowingly as well.

It is not the Laplu that are evil, but individuals themselves. Yes. Yes. That that makes sense. Stay strong.

Thank you. Thank you for your your time. When when I was speaking with, the, the the chieftain, he mentioned that, they are only able to communicate with you to you with the the vaguest of senses. Is there a more concrete message that you would like me to give to them? Yes.

It has been many years since one of them had the power to speak to me. I would say that you you may tell them that Vara trusts them with a great task and a great, and and their sacrifices here in this place will go down in the annals of history in the, in the Star Kingdom. Oh, that would add. Okay. Okay.

They I assume they know about the temple. Right? I mean, they can see as well as I can and kinda look down. They may know about the temple, but I don't think that they really thought much of it. Okay.

You may have seen it, but there are a bunch of there are many buildings here. Oh. Not many buildings around, but, like, there are many buildings in in this area, so they may have just considered it to be Oh, okay. I would think. I don't.

Alright. I kinda would route everybody. And let's see. That's that's kinda kinda all I got. Did anybody else have anything they wanted to to ask?

Nobody else knows what's going on. Well, you're certainly passing passing back and forth. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yep. Yep. No. That's quite a quite a mouthful.

Alright. Well, it's been a been a pleasure of of a lifetime. I've lived long, not nearly as long as you have, but, I I it's it is quite, infrequent that I get to experience something new and exciting like this. So so thank you. Thank you for your time.

The pleasure was mine. I look forward to seeing what what animals are written of you for in the, in the halls of star in the halls of the stars. Indeed. Me too. Alright.

Alright. Cool. Cool. Okay. Well, you guys return back to the, back to, the town.

Okay. So, well, and, yeah. So so what do you, what do you do when you get back? Do you go back and chat with, the, the chieftain, or are you just gonna kinda mill around a little bit, wait to hear what what comes from the comes from the, the Goblin or anything else anybody else wants to do? I mean, I'll I'll after that, I'll explore and listen to the, you know, what if OR tells the chief team what's going on, and and I'll explore the the island and talk to people.

Okay. So So something specific. Okay. So just in general, like, you you definitely do feel like there's, you know, the this these people, while they see while they at first seem standoffish, they they have warmed up to you pretty pretty significantly over the past, three or four days. Again, the again, Toadwin had Toadwin just isn't coming back.

Like, he hasn't returned for the for the entire time that you were there. And, Yeah. This is gonna this isn't necessarily going to hit nearly as much, but there are but, our you do notice that there are, a cup like, there's, like, an elderly trip key, lady who is basically using a piece of, Lumopolous, tapestry as a blanket. Oh. And it and it covers part of the story of creation of Etheria.

Oh. And what caught your eye specifically about this, is the story is referencing the use of music in the creation of the story. So it's a reference to the Lanoue you would Interesting. Yeah. Okay.

Okay. Yeah. I'd I'd I'd maybe, ask if I could take a look at it a little closer and kind of explain the significance, why I wanna look at her blanket. Sure. She yeah.

Once once you explain kind of what you're trying to do, she she isn't nearly as, you know, like, don't take my blanket. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. She'll let you she'll let you take a look at it. Sure. And she says that her, her grandson fished it out of the north fished it out of the, out of the sea by the northwestern flipper of Uluru. So the the general direction of the temple.

The temple. Yeah. Okay. One of, my thoughts during all the time here is is there a way that I and or Kahir could, use our smithing and crafting skills to bolster, aid, upgrade anything in the town? I'm sure that there are there are definitely repairs and things that could be that could be done and help build to help build and solidify, especially the stone walls.

Like, you know, this area has been pretty heavily, it's obvious that it's been under siege. So, that's definitely something that they would that they would that they would definitely grateful for. And I would also, our I I did also want to Mhmm. Point out this isn't a perfect solution. But I I want you to I want you to at least have something that you might not have thought about.

Uh-huh. Forget who's got it, but somebody here has a potion of fire resistance. Oh. That they picked up. You are right.

I I don't remember who, but somebody's got it. Alright. Right. I don't have it in my inventory. It's not yes.

Says potion of fire resistance? Yeah. Oh. Be happy to give it to you. I would probably need more than one, but we might be able to acquire more.

Right. So, yeah, that's that's kind of the that's kind of the puzzle here. Yeah. Is you do have a potion fire resistance. So but that is, but that is reverse engineer it.

Or, if you have a potion crafting skill, maybe. This is an this is a item levels. This is a level six item, so it's actually above your level. But, you know, as far as, like, if you wanna do something if you wanna try and do something with crafting to be able to kind of make it work for you, This this specific fire resistance thing, potion, if you, fire resistance five against fire damage for one hour for one person. Mhmm.

So, if you if you guys come up with any ideas about how you might want to re rejigger the potion or make something, you know, or or use the potion in some way, like crafting something that would that would kind of create some some sort of solution for that. Or if you just wanna have one person down and then go go down there and try and fight the sharks themselves, you know, you can you can do that. I suppose for a car, sir. That'd be you. You're the you're the guy that can whack things.

This reverse engineering thing is why I got this. Oh, you do have reverse engineering. Oh, sec. Checking and create a formula from an item. Oh.

Got it. If I create the least succeed, I can create the formula Oh. And reassemble the original item at the same time. Well, that sounds like That sounds like a like, amazing. Yeah.

So, basically, because because you just pick this up? Yes. I don't know how to Like, seriously, I had all like, I had this big I had this big, long line of clues of pointing you guys towards this temple, and then Ramsey just shows up and says, hey. I can speak with animals. And then I'm like and then I'm like, alright.

You need to figure out this way a way to make this fire resistant potion that only works for one person for an hour into doing something else. And Scott comes along. He's like, I got reverse engineering now. Great job, guys. You're amazing.

That's awesome. That's what I picked up today. Oh, amazing. Yeah. And I and I'm legit.

I'm like, I'm not I'm not saying it from any kind of any kind of snark whatsoever. I'm loving how this is working out here, guys. So good job. Well, that's hilarious. Love it.

I don't know how it works. It's sounding cool. Alright. Yeah. So as far as, like, the reverse engineering is concerned, like, I don't think that this is going to be something where you like, the the purpose of reverse engineering is to be able to create a formula, an object.

But because this object is such is so high level, like, I wouldn't necessarily be in a place where I'm like, yeah. You can just create fire resistance a fire resistance formula and that kind of thing. But you can totally use your use your reverse engineering to try and basically make this make this formula kind of spread out. The end. Yeah.

So it'll work for so it'll work for the whole party. I think that's a perfect use of that. Yeah. Is fire resistance just because the water's on fire? Yeah.

The well, the water's, boiling hot. Yeah. Okay. And then we have the sharks are not dying, though. What's not dying?

The shark the sharks. The sharks are they are not dying, and that is because they are fire sharks. These the brine shark, which is that which is that kind of shark, has fire resistance. Oh. And I would and I wouldn't give you that information ahead of time except, well, they're currently swimming around inside of Fire Lake, so it's kinda obvious.

Yep. Alright. So friend, Prince Truidore, was he able to be in the water? He actually stays as far away from the water as he possibly can. So when he was hiding, he was hiding in the water.

Okay. Oh, oh, and that is a good point. Are going to have prince Troubadour. Now that you've made it back, prince Troubadour is going to be leaving the party. He should probably be healed, and so should Carson and Samir.

Yeah. Every everybody should be back up at full. So just go ahead and go ahead and, sleep a bunch of times until you're until you're fully rested. How do I do that? If you go to the lower left hand corner where the extras are, the little three boxes, click on that, it says rest for the night.

Mhmm. Oh, boy. Every time, I keep missing one of those things. Okay. Extras.

Lower left corner. There's, like, dice looking box things. Yep. Right next to the hand. Oh, yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's a dice. There.

One night. Now I'm not saying that Prince Troubadour won't help out, you know, if if if you guys need it or anything, but he is not a he is not a PC. He is literally an NPC. He's not me playing another character. So Yep.

Since everybody else kinda said some my thought was during that two days when Elwar was talking to the animal, I would ask the princess to walk me around the town and tell me her story and try to figure out why her brother if there's anything behind, like, him not returning. Is there any strained relationships and things like that at the town? That make sense? Yeah. Yeah.

So, I'm not trying to get with her. Just trying to, like, have a guide. You know? It's PG. She's yes.

Whatever. You're trying to get with her? We we run a A little tiny frog. P g run a PG to PG 13 game here. So, you know, I no.

And in any case, Cruella will, basically just kinda let you know that, there's really no animosity in the family itself. She did she and toadwyn both think that, Oguin, which is prince Troubadour, is a bit of a weirdo. But it's not like there's no animosity in that. It's just more along lines of, like, oh, this is our cute our cute baby brother, you know, that kind of thing. They do respect his ability.

So it it's not it's not that he's, you know, considered to be, you know, subpar to anybody, but he is still in training. She has basically found her place in the tribe as, the chief diplomat and adviser to the chief. So, she hasn't been able to use her diplomatic abilities for a while, just because the only thing to diplomacy is in this swamp are goblins that wanna kill them and undead creatures that, you know, are undead and unreasonable. But she has served as an adviser to the chief for about four or five years at this point, and she respects his wisdom and he respects, her perspective. As far as Toadwin is concerned, you get that Toadwin is more of a classical protective older brother sort of thing.

He's not cocky. He's not, like, you know, he he he doesn't, like, think that he's he he's not itching to take over the chiefdom or anything. He just wants to he wants to protect his people and, you know, look out for his family. That's really kinda why he left was his brother had been missing for, for about three weeks by the time that he decided to take off. And, you know, it it wasn't that it wasn't that Boguian just up and disappeared.

Like, he went on a went on a raid. He did he was doing exactly what he told you guys. Like, he was, going for he he was going to attack the undead that were getting a little bit too close to his territory to their territory. But when he didn't return, Odwun, decided that he needed to, take matters into his own hands and go find his little brother. Do they know his travel plans?

They That's where he went. Right. They he went in the same direction that Bogwin went. So he basically followed after where Bogwin Bogwin was. As you guys haven't didn't run into him either way surprising.

And it's possible that he may have been diverted. And when you mentioned that, like, kind of to Barela, you do notice a a note of concern in her features. She's still a good enough diplomat that, like, you don't see the full thing. But as a sibling yourself and, you know, that kind of thing, you you would you would definitely notice that, you know, there's a little bit more of a a of concern going on with her, towards Toadwin because, like, he Toadwin is known as an excellent tracker. He's definitely somebody who knows the woods and how to operate in them and, is well respected in the village for his hunting capabilities.

So it's very un it's very odd that, you know, you wouldn't have run into him when you're basically walking around with with Boguan. Right. So that's the that's the information that you're able to glean from her about that. If there's anything else that you wanna dig in is there anything else that you wanna dig in deeper to? Like, any new questions pop up with that information?

No. I mean, for me, I just come kinda concerned, and it'd be interesting if the other prisoner dude knows anything about Toadwin. I saw him. I agree. Right.

I was thinking about trying to sharpen my ax and shave some of his back hair with it. So Oh, you are you are free to help out with with the interrogation if you you so desire. Okay. Oh, we gotta go we gotta go get Elmer's song. Correct.

It's too many things to do, too many things to do. Alright. So, Scott, I once once you do figure out, like, okay. We need to we need to figure out something to do, with the fire resistance potion. If you want to roll a reverse engineer skill check, I think that would just be a crafting check.

Right? Yeah. That's what it said to do is crafting, and then it said something about plus two. Like, I was rereading that. I don't understand it.

Between Basically, it's showing a gain a plus two circumstance bonus to crafting checks to reverse engineering a formula from an item. So, what that what that'll mean is if you go into skills and well, yeah. You can just roll a craft a crafting, and then we'll just add a plus two to it. That sucks. It didn't suck, but it wasn't enough to be able to actually accomplish the, accomplish the the thing.

Really like in those sevens. Do you wanna use a hero point? Hero? That's what I just tried to do. Use a hero point.

Yeah. So it it should have been 17, not a seven. So Mhmm. Maybe I have that setting turned off. Oh, I'll make sure that rerolled using a hero point.

Yeah. No. You rerolled using a hero point. So, we'll that would make it a 19 plus six. So that's a 25.

That seems pretty good. With the 25 We need this. We need it. Yeah. With the 25, you are able to reverse engineer it to a certain extent.

So I'm gonna give you I'm gonna give you a few options about what you can do here. So, one, you can divide the time that it the time that you have, by four. So it's an hour. You can switch it out into four separate portions that will give you fifteen minutes. Or, you can had another option in mind, but I forgot what it was.

Okay. So, I you you can do that. So you can split it four times. You can split it two times. You can, turn it into a, turn it into a, an oil, that you can put on, put on, like, a, on a wetsuit that would grant that same grant that same, that same fire resistance for the hour for four people.

But it since it's on a wetsuit, if you do take any damage whatsoever, then the then the fire resistance is lessened as as you go. So for every endpoints of damage you take, you you you reduce your fire damage or fire resistance by one. And I I think that I think that that that's it. Unless somebody else has an idea about something else that would be a a good compromise for that. Well, I think that's good.

Yeah. Does the turtle have any extra skin? It was probably quite attached to what it has. Oh, shoot. You never know.

Or a submergeable submarine that we could borrow. You you could, in fact, fashion some sort of submarine, with that using using this same same basic principle that would be, like, you could use the fire resistance potion to create a fire resistance submarine, if you wanted to, which But if it got damaged, it would No. No. It would be it it would just be you would have a fire resistant submarine. The the the crux on or or not the crux.

The, the potential problem with that is that there are a bunch of sharks down there. And are you going to be able to defend yourself in that in that submarine? So you guys kinda do I like to live dangerously and go fifteen minutes, so let's go full bore right after this. Guy that can crush things. I don't know how well my ax swings in underwater.

That's because slows things down. Indeed. That's true. But the electric arc shouldn't be interesting underwater. It could spread to all sharks.

Or us. Or us. Not done a lot of fighting underwater, so I have no idea. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. No. I do think the sharks are a concern. Mhmm.

What's our swimming movement compared to our regular movement look like? Good question. Your your swimming movement is it depends on your it depends on your athletics role. So, it can be anywhere from half movement to, two full movement just depending on how well you how well you roll. Also, I'm not sure if there I I seem to remember somebody had some sort of, like helps you in the water, oceans or items or something in here as well.

So check your inventory for that. I don't know where I have any of that wind stuff. Well, that's because I handed out these magic I that's because I handed out these magic items, and they didn't do more damage, so you didn't pay attention. Oh, wow. But that's not just you, Cutter.

Yeah. I mean, that's that's a standard thing. Like, it like, role playing game groups is like, oh, this is a useful item. I could pay it. I don't care about it.

It doesn't do more damage. Oh, no. That one that you gave me allows me to cast bubble, so it would allow people to breathe underwater. Yeah. That's useful.

That is useful. Yeah. I don't have anything that would be useful. I don't know that I could cast it enough for everybody. But Yeah.

Yeah. The bubbling scale, I think, is what it was, and that was and that's in Samir's inventory. For an hour, you can hold your breath for 15 rounds plus your constitution modifier instead of five rounds plus your constitution modifier. There's no active nonaquatic environments. Yeah.

So that's scale. Carson literally just has his weapons and armor. What's that? It's all you need. Right?

That's all I need. Is that leveling skill? That's a consumable. Yeah. So it's a onetime use and, you know giving giving that along with the air bubble, you know, depending that should give everybody enough time to be able to maybe get down there.

Yeah. And just to be and and just for the record, the goal isn't to kill all the sharks. It's just to get to the temple. Yeah. Yep.

It doesn't mean that you have to fight every shark that you come up against. Right? Right? That's a novel concept. I mean, I know some of you that the quickest the quickest like, I mean, for for, like, to hear, probably the quickest way of getting of escaping a shark is to just chop it in half.

But for the rest of you, you know Yeah. Yeah. I can move. Alright. Okay.

So we're going with fifteen minutes? Or west You wanna just swing down there as fast as you could. Yeah. In the fifteen minutes, we'd get down there, but, getting back. I mean, who knows?

There could be all kinds of things in that temple that could help us get back, but we'd be relying on it. Yeah. That's not a good next strategy. Why not? It's probably a portal.

I mean, maybe. Or you could boil yourselves to death with the linole in your hand. Right. Right. Man, I thought the turtle would, like, swallow us like the whale.

Bit it bit us down there somehow. Big pull of Jonah. Can't solve all your I can't solve all your problems. You gotta Hellwire can talk to the guy. Nobody else can talk to him.

Alright. Alright. He seems very friendly. He's here to help, and he said we are supposed to go. Make a way, my friend.

However, if he dives under, he dives down in the boiling lane die. Frogs die. That's true. That's true. Is anybody else besides me sneaky?

Not really. I have great survival. Oh. Do you mean stealth or you mean Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Like stealth. I'm stealth trained. You're breaking stealth? Okay.

Okay. Okay. Let me see. Stealth, I am untrained. Okay.

I may have a solution then. Oh, nope. I didn't take that spell. Damn it. I think that what I took would be better anyway.

But, well, more fun, maybe. Okay. Alright. Well, I definitely think the the time that we're waiting would be best spent trying to get down to the temple. I am just Yes.

Unsure what is the best method. I would love to do the wetsuit thing because then we all have an hour. We just gotta figure out a good way to get past those sharks without taking you know, without attacking them, essentially. Oh, and just just, just I don't know if I don't know if this is being considered, but it probably is. But, that's damage taken, not damage absorbed and that kind of thing.

So it's like if that, like, shield blocks, we've got, like, champion's reaction, we got different things that basically makes it so you don't take damage. Right. As long as the as long as the most damage that anybody takes is under 10, hit points, then you still have full fire resistance. Yep. Yep.

Yep. That's fair. So and That is fair. So if you've if you've got ways of mitigating damage and you're maximizing damage mitigation, you're still you're you're still, you know, you're still in good shape. Yep.

Yep. Yep. So just just a thought. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Soon as it is. Yeah.

I really think that's our best shot. And I was like, the fifteen minute thing, I I don't think that gives us enough time to get down there and explore and get back up. That's what really worries me. Yeah. We don't have a lot of time.

Yep. Yep. Yep. This can I do I got a nature or some sort of knowledge check? You absolutely can.

Be about the behaviors of the sharks, the, Oh, sure. Yeah. Role role nature. Food, you know, preferences, things like that. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Dragon part. Boom.

Fire. I did as good as I ever do. Oh, yeah. You're you're you're a point. Yeah.

Yeah. That's fair. Do LSA. Oh, where do I have that? Do you wanna find a if you right click on the on the, yep, reroll with hero point.

Oh, look at that. I got I got a nine that time. Oh, you're adding 10 to it because it's under because it's under 10. So that's actually a 26 that you rolled. I don't doesn't get a whole lot better than that.

Alright. So here's what you know about brine sharks. One, brine sharks are not are are not natural, they're not natural animals. They're actually, they're actually elementals. Mhmm.

They generally do not roam around in groups. They're Hey. Pretty solitary. The way that these specific sharks are swimming, it's it's very clear to you, Sameer, that they are patrolling. And Mhmm.

And it seems like they're a, if if you were to interpret kind of the situation, is there the second layer of defense for the for the temple itself? Mhmm. So, if anybody if anybody or anything gets close to them, they have a tendency to they they just they just attack. So and there are other there are other creatures that are in this water, not a lot of them because most creatures don't have fire resistance, but there are some things that have survived. And if anything gets within a certain parameter in the temple, then the brine sharks attack.

But as long as you stay outside of the parameter, they they don't they don't mess with anything. K. Do I have to use my, elemental flow or elements flow through channel elements? Yes. I just need to see where that is.

And we are at 10:00 right now. Just just just so everybody knows. So this is probably going to be about where we, yeah, about where we ended. So as your kinetics, your kinetics stuff, Yeah. It's it would be under, panel elements, and it's kinetic aura.

Yeah. So basically higher aura. Yeah. So that doesn't the, that doesn't give you resistance. It just Okay.

It you basically have to channel elements in order to be able to use your kinet assist powers. So Okay. Well, I tried. But here. Yeah.

You've got your fire blast. But let me get over to your base kinesis, you we what you picked up. You gain the base kinesis impulse for the purposes of determining when the range and bulk improvements of your actions occur. And that's this level equal to half of your level. Ace Kinesis for tenth of a character.

This feat would have range 45 feet. In fact, one bulk of the chosen element. K. So you can set things on fire. What that is?

K. T. Alright. I gotta go. Okay.

Clark, before before before you go, you do have underwater marauder. I'm not underwater. You've learned to fight underwater. You are not off guard while in the water. Don't take the Do I have that app?

For using bludgeoning or slashing melee weapons in the water. Do your campaign feed. Useful. Oh, that seems useful. Yay.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's not gonna fit in the water. Yay.

Somebody can find me in the water. And we've got brilliant toughness that everybody has, but that's that's spare damage. Okay. Oh, I guess this is kind of we'll we'll go ahead and we'll go ahead and end it for today, and, pick up next time. So in the meantime, if we can figure out exactly how we want to approach the, the sharks and that kind of stuff, great.

Or we can chat about it for an hour or two when we when we get when we get here. I'm sure I'm sure it'll be both. So Thank you.
