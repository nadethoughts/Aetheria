# Transcript
so yeah when when uh where where we left off uh you you did go to the temple find you find those
artifacts it was revealed to you that you are reincarnations of previous uh of of
previous versions of yourself or previous iterations um maybe it's still unclear like what
what you really are as far as like reincarnation you know you lived a life in the past but you're
not sure whether or not you are um it's like the a full-on like buddhist style reincarnation or if
just the power of that previous person was bestowed upon you you're not really sure um
but at this point could be anything um when you returned uh yet the the the turtle um oluru
was under attack um and you did help end off the goblin tribe that was attacking uh the firewalker
tribe that was attacking the um people there and uh then it was discovered that um toadwin
was still missing which was concerning as he was known as a master tracker
at that point you decided that you wanted to try to um try to find him
um but weren't really sure where to look and then samir had a vision in his um in his mirror
that showed toadwin in a um toadwin captured um by a um by a hag um that looked like that
uh and was in a it was in a redwooded forest um you went into the swamp and um or a redwooded
swamp like the leaves themselves and the the area itself was red um it was discovered that the
at those trees do exist however the um uh the namar zul um never went that direction and even when they
did it was kind of like they would get all muddled and turned around and end up you know going ending
end up going in a different direction um than the direction that they intended um
so you decided that you wanted to go and move towards those red trees in order to be able to
in order to be able to do that um oh also not only was there that mind situation that was happening but
also the giant frog monster um that was uh like i the the it was a 40 foot tall frog behemoth
um had a tendency to hang around in that area so the namars will kind of steer clear of it
um you asked prince troubadour to accompany you to go and help um go and help you rescue his brother
um prince troubadour being the youngest son of chief crocmar of the namarsul um and he agreed
you all headed in the uh direction of the redwoods and while um it was like there was um
you made some will some willpower saves and different things you guys were all able to
um not get yourselves turned around also with the aid of the mirror of ashes
um which is um is samir's artifact um it was able to kind of give you
the bonuses that you need in order to be able to overcome the mind um the mind screw that was
happening with um moving into those trees you did make it in there um you are keeping your
eye on out for the um the frog frog hemoth um but uh you have not you've seen it and it does definitely
patrol that area a lot more than the others but you have thus far been able to avoid it um
um and where we pick up um you were able to um as jason suggested you were able to kind of pick up
um the direction of where you think the goblin camp was and we're moving in that direction
when you were ambushed by a bunch of goblins and that is where we are
so you are in the red the red swamp
yay for us
any uh any questions before we jump in we're we're just going to jump be jumping straight into combat
here so any questions or anything you want to do before i uh before i switch things out here
that whole thing that you described to us about the extra stuff we got you're going to tell us when
to use that right right right oh i i will i will keep an eye out for opportunities to prompt you
on how on how to use those things for all right i've been googling but it's not it's not clear for me
so i yeah understand
and scott at least for yours um at least for yours um there's not going to be a whole lot of like
additional stuff you're going to have to worry about so yeah great
uh pull player oh no
well i got to see
got an error so i'm refreshing okay uh foundry virtual table oh requires a usable
window does that matter um i think you probably have just a smaller um
um it wants you to have a higher um
it wants you to have a uh have a higher resolution on your monitor is probably what oh gotcha
uh is everybody else getting pulled in like clark clark's here i'm here
that's here what's here i just want gray that's what i'm reloaded yeah yeah just go ahead and
reload mine did that yeah that's what i had to do had to reload it yeah there we go loaded it i
got some red stuff i see a bog now i see a lot of goblins
loading is tough okay there we go i didn't think that this bog was going to be was going to be
that that hard of a list for us here
all right so i all oh let me uh let me get you guys's hero points all all squared away here
uh reset to one
submit all right everybody should have their hero points set um and then just have just need everybody
to roll your uh all your initiative so if you go into combat tab or
click on your character in in the combat carousel
able where
which one am i doing i said it right oh six okay yeah so
he has no token in the scene
i do don't i oh is this your that's your old character that's this yeah so let me let me actually
drop your real character in here oh well that'll be nice thanks yeah is this my real character
uh yeah so i need to add him to the combat pool though so
okay
that
add him all right now dip now you have to go yep should get you
start off strong with a one what a crummy roll all right well we got that all the way
yeah i don't want to go last pressure all the people i don't want to go last that's a terrible roll
all right so
um this troubadour is going to take himself out of combat
what
he's going to he's basically going to pull his his turn and wait to see what happens before he starts
before he does anything
do i have to
that so i have this skill feat that's not natural do i have to
um
um i have to put that i have to turn that on when it's appropriate
what i'm sorry which
it's it's called that's not natural okay
i'm assuming i have to activate that when it's appropriate
it says that this is effective on aberration and fey mutant and undead yeah so it's a reaction
so okay which means it has a trigger
so you gain a plus one circumstance bonus to all initiative checks made at the start of battle with
in which at least one of your enemies is an aberration fey mutant or undead okay
yeah so that does apply here oh it does so you have yeah so you have a 14
instead of a 13
in your initiative and then that also affects
perception dc by one
uh okay
uh
uh we knew christmas
master and survival and circumstances increases to plus two
um so your survival survival is not master so it's not a plus two yet but that will be
plus one um so yeah so whenever you're doing a perception check you basically effectively get
plus one okay on it okay okay yeah all right good all right thanks yeah i didn't know how to
make that happen yeah no it's all good i don't know if i needed to do that before i rolled my
initiative i don't know if these characters necessarily fit that any of those
yeah so you'll just want to make sure that you that you just bring that up because it's not
got gonna automatically do it but um as long as you can be like is there an undead in here
is there a fey and aberration gotcha yeah yeah nine times out of ten if you're fighting something
it's going to be one of those four on those one of those four will be in there all right yeah
and then i need to do a wellspring
thing right um i think at this point you are fresh so you don't have any
any i have any spells yeah all right uh so spells
it does not look like it it looks like everything is
okay so uh so i mean we can still go through the process you would roll for the wellspring and if
you had um if you had that you'd be able to refresh one of them that kind of thing i'd
do that by clicking in my feets pulling that particular feat up
right
spring control you generate a wellspring surgical twice
in the wellspring surges table take the result of your choice
so it looks like it's just a flat check to start with right
so then i'll just go here and do a d20
or a flat check
oh i clicked the button oh oh i got an 18. that's lovely no idea of diamonds
um okay yes
okay so
okay so you attempt a
limit to how many temporary spell slots you gain per day and select another dedication until looking
i'm not going to pop
um
spring magic fills the power fully under your control when you roll initiative for a non-trivial
combat encounter as well as in other high stress situations gm's choice the magic wells up within you
attempt a dc6 flat check uh if you succeed
i think i got over six this time yeah yeah just a little bit
okay 18. so that would be a critical success you temporary temporarily recover an expended spell slot of
any rank of any rank of your choice the temporary spell slot lasts one minute
if you don't use it by then you experience an immediate wellspring surge
it sounds um
and yeah so you would have recovered it you don't have anything to recover it but
right so so at this point i would roll my perception i'd roll a d20 as a flat check against a six
right and then i can kind of determine what i need to do from there
right assuming i have available spell slots right i retain one
three rounds or a minute depending on whether it's a success or critical success and a
minute is 10 rounds
right okay one minute is 10 rounds
okay okay i think i got my head wrapped around that for a second yes all right i'm glad you do
let me play
all right cool
all right any other pre-combat things we need to take care of before before i get into this
i don't think so
um
um you see a um
a shambling um
armored
skeleton
that's not natural
it's definitely not natural
um that comes out of the um that comes out of the brush behind the goblins
um
it looks like it still has some flesh on it
yeah yeah well you know
skeleton's not been dead long enough
yeah it looks gross
well said
um and it's going to
to be very sad that it doesn't have a ranged attack
and stand there and look menacing
let's see if we can target
here
and see if we can do a
uh
hey
to moralize
probably not going to be able to do that but it's trying to scare you
possible here
oh
it might actually do
um
he did scare you
he he did
i did not believe in him but
but you see this shambling this shambling um
skeleton coming out of the force that rushes past the goblins that you did see
and it raises its axe and um this this guttural screech comes out of its maw that you
didn't really think would be possible out of just a pile of bones
um and you are spooked
and
next up is
this guy
and then a small goblin
uh
moves forward
pulls out his short bow
and he's going to
target kahir as well
yeah
i'm super way down the line
he's going to miss
but he's going to try again
no
okay
is that the sound effects of the guy
no that was me
oh i thought it did sound like a little
oh there's a
yeah there there are sound effects in there yeah
oh okay that's cool
yep
um
all right well he took a couple of shots at kahir but here dodged out of them
as he as he's side as he's side eyeing this skeleton
um super spooky
and kahir you're it's your turn what are you gonna do
question at the very bottom of my stuff underneath like rage and stuff
it says affect demoralize immunity
yes
uh that was because he successfully demoralized you
so you are immune to demoralization
okay
so you can't really
really cool
when if you
really scare you
cover over the people it tells you how far they are away
yeah
that's cool
yeah the version 13 is is
it's got some pretty nice quality of life updates to it
sure did you have to pay for that update
uh nope nope i paid for this tool i i paid for this product once and
never had to pay for it again
that's awesome
i like it
uh i can't move
oh let me see about that
you should be
there we go
where was i somewhere in there do i have to walk on the planks here
uh yeah you you don't want to get into the water um the water itself is um boiling hot if you remember
so where am i we're standing right now is not the water
right
so can i move up by this guy
so yeah so it'd be let's see
35 feet so yeah
well it it you've got a movement of oh you've got movement 35 yeah
yeah
not a dwarf anymore chris
wait you have
yep you got plenty of plenty of space to do do that stuff
all right um i'm just making sure my
weapons up and i don't have the titan swing on i've got rage
um
oh and um
No. Yep. Absolutely. All right.
It's not telling me hit or miss on my
thing. Is that
are you guys seeing hit or miss? You did hit.
Are you not seeing it?
Even when they were
when you were trying to hit me, it didn't tell me
hit or miss. It just showed a score.
Well, I
mean, like I
did make some adjustments to some of the configs
and maybe it's not on there, but yes, you did hit
hit by you hit by five
on this guy.
Okay. It does show
damage right away. So I assumed I hit, but I don't know.
Yep.
It doesn't say any of that stuff.
So you're aware.
Right.
All right. So you run up, you swing
and you hit him
dealing 18
points of damage, but he is still
alive.
Oh,
you didn't drop
him on the first time.
Not this time.
So you do have one
additional action
that you can spend
at this point.
Yeah, I was going to hit him again,
but my actions all went away.
Do you guys still have those?
If you
do you have your character
with a bunch of numbers
and stuff over
top of your character image?
No.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Click on that.
And
oh, there it is.
Chris, I don't see myself
in the first
grouping.
Oh,
it'll scroll.
Your character
will show up.
You just rolled
so low.
You're
so far down
on the initiative
order.
Yeah, thanks.
Not to make you feel bad.
No, man.
All right.
You come back
around
and
just crush
this thing
with fear.
The thing that
caused you to be
afraid
you decided
Afraid no longer.
needed to be
dead dead
and you succeeded.
Right down
on the top
of his helmet.
It just
and splits
in two.
There you go.
Done.
Right.
Goblin.
Here.
There.
I think he's
going to
target
Prince
Troubadour
and
they'll have
two bow shots.
First one
hits.
And
second one
misses.
misses.
All right.
And that's
what
that's going
to do.
I'll
wear
Europe.
These
goblins are
wielded
bows.
Bows and
dog slicers.
So they got
they got
melee and
they got
they got
ranged.
All right.
Cool.
Cool.
Cool.
Well,
obviously the
first thing
we're going
to do
is say
the words.
So we
courageous
say them
with the
lingering thing
which is
all this
macro
which is
great.
Okay.
Getting
why am I
not?
Yeah.
That's on.
That's on.
And then
I also
get one
more for
that.
Okay.
All right.
bam.
We did
it.
Three rounds
sick.
So that was
action one.
Action two
I'm going to
use a new
thing because
it's dope
as shit.
Really?
Yeah.
Really?
Seriously just
put that right
down the
toilet.
I am going
to use
transfer
vitality.
Oh.
And I'm
going to
transfer.
How do I
where's the
actual action
for this?
Transfer
vitality.
Yes.
I would
like to
do that.
Maybe
target
someone.
I don't
know.
New ability.
Who this?
do do
do do
do do
do.
Um.
Yes.
Uh,
yes.
Vitality
network.
Sure.
Transfer
vitality.
Uh,
yes.
Yes.
I,
I,
that's
what I
would like
to do.
Um,
anyway.
Doesn't
really
matter.
Uh,
I can't
figure out
how to
do it
right now,
but it
doesn't
matter.
Um,
I'm going
to transfer
one point
of vitality
from my
vitality
network,
uh,
to my
good
friend,
uh,
Karsten.
Okay.
Who,
while being at
four hit points,
um,
getting the
extra hit point
does not do
anything.
Um,
however,
due to my
connection to
rhythm,
uh,
I have this
neat harmony
thing,
uh,
when I
transfer
vitality,
or no,
not that
one,
perfect
harmony.
The first
time each
round you
transfer
vitality,
the target
who,
oh,
who regained
hit points.
Oh.
I'd say that
doesn't actually
work then.
I think they
actually have to
regain a hit
point for that
to work.
All right,
just kidding.
We'll save
the cool stuff
for later.
Uh,
it will be
cool.
I promise.
Uh,
but in that
case,
two and
three,
oh,
that just
messed up
my whole
mojo.
Uh,
who's so
excited?
Oh,
it's fine.
I will
still be
excited.
Um,
how
far,
that's
30 feet.
I don't
think I'm
30 feet
from anything.
No,
I am not.
So I cannot
do that.
Um,
that's
fine.
Uh,
all right,
so for
two,
we will
enter
the
strategist
stance,
which again,
I am
trying to
do,
but it's
not doing.
need it.
Okay,
so,
uh,
warfare,
uh,
hang on.
Use this
action.
Yeah,
okay.
Yeah,
okay,
except
what I'm
really doing
is my,
my lore,
uh,
there's not
a good way
to do that
here,
I see.
So,
okay,
we'll just
do it live.
We'll just
roll a
Mardic
lore here.
All right.
Uh,
cool,
cool,
25.
That's
versa DC
of my
level.
Um,
so I'm
not sure
if that
is
critical
success
or standard
success,
but I'm
sure it
is a
success.
Yeah,
I think
it'd be a
critical
success.
Okay.
Cool,
cool,
cool,
cool.
Um,
all right.
So I,
that's
free to
see if
them,
that's
free to
see if
them.
Okay.
So,
I enter
strategist
stance.
Yeah,
how do I
get that
on me
though?
That is
a good
question.
I'm not
sure.
Do that.
Oh,
hey,
there we
go.
I got
it.
I got
it.
Okay.
I just
dragged
it out
of myself
and then
chose the
kind of
success.
All right,
cool.
Oh,
cool,
cool,
cool,
cool.
Um,
and
self-guard
me by
an ally
within
your
aura.
Okay,
so I'm
going to
have to
move up
to do
much of
anything
else,
so we
may as
well just
do that
now.
I don't
want to
move up
a lot,
but we'll
move up
to like,
I think
I was still
measuring.
We'll move
up to like
here.
This seems
fine.
All right,
that's me.
That's all
three.
it was a
setup turn,
it was a
setup turn.
So,
I'm used
to,
I guess I
don't know,
did the
courageous
anthem
apply to
everybody
automatically
or?
Oh,
it should,
yes.
And I,
but I saw
it.
Nope,
maybe not.
It is not
currently
applying to
some
mirror.
Oh,
that's
weird.
I don't
think it's
applying to
me.
Maybe,
I think
the
aura
is
in the
range.
We'll
think you're
outside the
aura,
which
60 foot.
Oh,
yeah.
Which you
should be
inside,
but
right.
unless
you're not
counting as
an ally.
That'd be
awkward.
Get him.
That would
be awkward.
They do not
want me as a
friend.
Hey,
I see myself.
There I am.
They don't want
me as an
enemy either,
but.
Um,
let me see
here.
Okay.
Uh,
some
here.
Experience.
Oh,
man.
Right.
He should
be.
Ramsey,
I'm going to
try.
Well,
he's even
within
your 20
foot.
Yeah.
There's
no reason
why he
should not
have that.
Drop it
on.
I'll just
drop it
on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Fix it in
post.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's not
your fault.
And thank
you for
pointing it
out.
I don't
want you to
not get
your bonuses.
I want
me to
not get
my bonuses
too.
And I
need to
see
pretty
desperately
here.
We're
gonna have
this
group.
They're
just gonna
try and
shoot
the
here.
here.
I'm
sorry.
Did we
not get
the bonus
or we
not yet?
What bonus?
The
courageous
anthem.
Oh,
yeah.
Everybody
else got
it.
For some
reason,
Samir
didn't pick
it up.
So.
But
everybody
else
automatically
got it.
Oh,
are you
sure?
Yeah,
you've got
it.
I don't
I just
don't
lost in
your sea
of it's
lost in
your sea
of other
things,
but it's
there.
I got
Marshall's
Aurora.
It's the
it's the
arm flexing
icon.
That's
courageous
anthem.
I don't
have an
arm flexing
icon.
I'm
looking right
at your
character right
now and I'm
seeing it on
it's there.
Oh,
it's not on
the right
side.
Well,
oh,
I see it
on the
right side
as well.
Maybe
maybe your
screen is
just it's
the second
to last
one.
It's right
underneath
the shield
with the
sword on
it.
The oath
of the
defender.
game's
not
liking
me.
Yeah,
well,
it just
doesn't
say
courageous
anthem.
No,
I see
the symbol
for it
there.
I don't
see an
arm,
so that's
why I'm
confused.
It's
right to
the bottom.
It's
about
seven
o'clock.
What?
Oh,
there.
Yeah.
Okay.
I see
what you're
talking about.
I was
looking over
on the
right side
where it
usually
pops up.
where all
the stuff
happens in
the chat.
Sorry.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I see
those over
there as
well,
but yeah.
Sorry,
that's my
thought.
Okay.
All right.
I see the
one arm
muscle now.
Yeah,
there you
go.
I mostly
arm went
away.
I don't
know.
It's not
liking me.
It's
whatever.
right here
is already
crushing
some
goblins.
Oh,
they're
moving.
He did.
Oh,
moving.
Yeah.
So we've
got more
goblins
running up
and there
again,
they're
kind of
at this
point,
they're
keeping
their
distance,
but they're
still
shooting.
Yeah.
Prince
to
got hit.
Oh,
cool.
I love
that.
All right.
I'm glad.
And then,
oh,
this one
will be
fun.
see here.
All right.
So a
goblin
runs up
from the
back.
He's
still got
a pretty
good
distance.
30 feet
to that.
Yeah.
Hmm.
Yeah.
All right.
So he's
going to
run up
and he's
going to
target.
He was
going to
target
Alwer,
but Alwer's
too far
out here
is just
in is
just there
and he's
going to
produce
flame.
Throw a
fire bolt
at him.
Motive
fire
and
miss.
It's going
to be
sad.
So yeah,
so here
a goblin
kind of
runs up
behind the
other group
of goblins
and makes
some weird
gestures.
He's got a
couple of
torches in
his hand.
He waves
them around
and he
flings and
he makes
a motion
and a
huge fireball
just or not
fireball,
but a ball
of fire
flies out of
flies out of
his torch
and whizzes
right by
your head.
Oh!
Who is that
torch?
My big head.
Here.
Looks like
it.
Your head
is not big
enough.
Apparently
I'm not.
Samir,
you're up.
Samir,
it's not
bigger,
but it
just
continued
to march.
sounds like
Jason is
having a
sidebar
conversation.
It's okay.
What's
going on?
Nothing.
Talking to
peoples.
nothing's
going on.
I think
that's the
whole point.
I'm joking.
He was
thinking I
think like
you there.
Yeah,
I don't even
think they'll
do that.
Sorry.
Some friends
of ours
gave
Allison
a text
their
water
tank
sprung
a
hole.
I guess
it
rusted
through
in a
spot.
So
they're
kind of
scrambling
to try
and figure
out
what's
going on
and what
they can
do.
Yeah.
Oh my.
Cool.
So
anyway,
I was
trying to
give
Allison
some
thoughts
there
real
quick.
All right.
So
it seems
to me
mildly
advantageous
to get
within
bow shot
of all
these
people.
I think
I'll
hold off
on that.
So
anyway,
at the
moment
I think
I'm
going
to
how do
I
move the
map?
There you
go.
Thanks for
moving.
Okay.
Okay.
How do
I click
on
multiple?
Shift
T.
Shift
what?
T.
If you
click on
it or
if you
hover over
something
and you
tap T
it'll
target it
and then
if you
have
shifts
down
and you
already
have
something
else
targeted
you can
target
multiple
times.
two
shift
T
okay
shift
T
so my
thought
was
to
find
myself
I
want
to use
the
thunder
strike
to
target
two
people
which
means
I
have
to
use
a
something
else
use
a
something
else
yeah
the
split
shot
feet
oh
yeah
um
it
doesn't
I'm
assuming
it
does
it
take
an
action
for
me
to
do
that
it
does
every
every
one
of
your
um
if
you
if
you
look
in
your
actions
area
there's
a
split
shot
thing
and
there's
a
it'll
tell
you
how
many
actions
you
have
to
use
in
order
to
be
able
to
do
it
each
spell
is
one
action
split
shot
is
one
action
so
in
order
for you
to be
able
to do
it
it
would
take
your
entire
three
to split
shot
and
then
thunder
thunder
strike
okay
so
anyway
um
i guess
i'm not
really
seeing
in my
actions
how
to
like
so
the
shaking
hands
basic
actions
that's
a
no
go
right
that's
not
where
i'm
going
to
find
it
right
uh
well
all
you
need
to
do
is
just
cast
the
spell
at
this
point
okay
so
i don't
have
to
i don't
have
to
modify
anything
there's
there's
no
yeah
there's
no
okay
um
automation
that's
set up
for split
shot
if you
have
two guys
targeted
then
it'll
just
apply
it
to
both
of
them
um
but
we
have
the
understanding
that
you
spent
your
first
action
for
modifying
the
spell
right
all right
all right
i see it
and i'm
gonna have
um
the two
goblins
make their
checks
right
um
so
it looks
like
one of
them
passed
and
one of
them
failed
so
go ahead
and
roll
damage
okay
did
the
courageous
anthem
actually
calculate
into
that
no
it
doesn't
matter
on
that
one
does
it
no
because
it's
because
courageous
anthem
helps
your
attacks
it doesn't
help
your
saves
okay
yep
good
that's a
pretty good
roll on
that
10
so
you
successfully
kill
one
and the
other
um
he
actually
critically
succeeded
so he
avoided
all
damage
oh
wow
lucky
jerk
that's a
very
that's a
very
impressive
success
then
he's
he is
quite
the
goblin
um
he uh
very
very
acrobatic
that one
very talented
hmm
you
have a
dead
goblin
all right
so you
have
so how
how do
you
how do
you do
this
let's add
some
flair to
this thing
you want a
little flair
i would
love a
little
flair
this
combat's
getting a
little
dry
let's
throw
some
flair
in here
oh
oh
oh man
at least
one piece
of flair
at least
one piece
of flair
um
i don't
know
from a
distance
they wouldn't
see a
whole lot
maybe a
little
uh
the hand
just kind
of
turns a
little
bluish
whitish
blue
and then
from above
a bolt
of lightning
comes down
and at the
last second
it arcs
off
into two
tendrils
nice
one of the
one of the
goblins
sees it
coming and
dances out
of the way
just in the
nick of time
and the other
one was
was blissfully
unaware
as he got
fricasseed
and he's
still blissful
he didn't
he didn't
even have
a chance
to uh
to be
to regret
his actions
he just
be gone
gone
all right
blissfully
dead
yes
nice job
all right
let's see
we get
yep
you will
however
attempt
it's going
to be a
hard
it'd be a
hard thing
you see
a trip
key
pop up
out of
the woods
alongside
the
alongside
the goblins
this trip
key
looks
emaciated
and
and
definitely
not
not
healthy
at the
best of
times
and it
pulls
a dagger
and
flings it
at our
through the
trees
oh
and
it was
a long
shot
um
and the
long shot
did
did in
fact
not
pay off
um
but the
the dagger
flies by
your uh
fly
flies
pretty wide
it actually
doesn't
doesn't even
make it to
you
it kind
of lands
in the
in in
the boardwalk
um
sticking up
in the
in the
boardwalk
at the
um
about
five ten
feet
about five
feet in
front of
you
um
and the
trip key
makes a
wailing
noise
um
at you
as well
and we
will go
ahead and
see if we
can demoralize
you
yeah
might be
too far
away
for that
but
only one
way to
find out
too far
you are
in fact
too far
but
that's
cool
you tried
yeah
yeah
all right
and you
see another
one of
those
um
another one
of those
skeleton
things just
starting to
shamble out
um
doesn't seem
to be in
too big
of a rush
as
i mean
doesn't
need to
be
and then
karsten
you're up
yay
i'm up
um
well since
here is on
the other
side
kill things
i guess
i'm gonna
move
yeah
oh that's
not how you
do it
how do you
move
you should
be able to
just click
and drag
oh yeah
all right
so you run
up to the
goblin
and i whack
him
right
right
um
so are you
going to be
just hitting
it with
your weapon
or are you
going to be
double slicing
i'll just hit him
with my weapon
okay
i did that
uh did i
i didn't
initiate my
double weapon
or i need to
shut it off
i think
oh there we
go
no
well so
so here
here's the
thing if you
are going to
be double
slicing
there's a
action
there's a
macro that
you use to
do that
which will be
different than
just hitting it
with your
weapon
no i'm just
hitting it
with my
weapon
okay
well then
don't worry
but regardless
you don't have
to worry about
that double
slice
second attack
checkbox
thing
you'll just
be executing
a macro
that will
that will
do the
double slice
i'm just
doing
winner's
dawn
strike
i think
okay
um
door
oh
yeah
looks like a
crit
i'll take
that one
holy cow
give me a
crit
uh yeah
that thing is
ridiculous
yeah i'll
take it
21 points
of damage
he what
orc
he's still
alive
why would
you think
that
because there
was no
little dead
thing there
um
and then
i think
i will
i can raise
my shield
right
can we walk
in these tree
areas where
all the
goblins
are or
no
uh yeah
you should
be able to
um
as long as
you're like
about the
only thing
is there
i think that
there are
like trunks
that you
wouldn't be
able to walk
through but
um
the map
should let
you know if
they're there
or not
so but
yeah you
should be able
to walk in
those no
problem
so that's
not water
okay
that's what i
want to know
right is there
a way to do i
lift up my shield
for more shield
points or is that
not a thing
anymore
no it is um
all you do
is um
in your
actions
area
um
actions
actions
we're in my
act
oh just a
minute
huh
hey
yep
okay
if you
raise
shield
block
there
i don't
see it
i promise
um
i'll tell you
what
we'll um
i don't see
one
oh you
currently have
your shield
raised
oh
even better
okay
then that's
it
so
i don't know
what to do
with one
action
oh there's
an action
thing
right
uh well
you used
them all
you
moved
attacked
and raised
your shield
oh i see
i just
already have
it
okay
perfect
that's all
i want
then
that's
great
yep
all right
and have
him
run up
to
here
and
strike him
with his
dog slicer
or miss
with his
dog slicer
and try
and attack
him again
with his
dog slicer
miss with
that one as
well
all right
that was a
successful
turn
um
we'll go
ahead and have
prince troubadour
jump in
yeah
you know
so
uh
i'm
prince troubadour
right there
all right
so he's
going to
step up
and
let's see
here
all right
he's going
to run
up to
this guy
um
prince troubadour
is going
to
use his
terrifying
croak
um
moralize
a creature
within 30
feet
to take
the penalty
attack
and
it's going
to use
his terrifying
he's going
to use
his terrifying
croak
against
the
um
against the
flaming
goblin
so he's
going to
attempt to
demoralize
him
and fail
to do
so
unfortunate
um
but
um
he is
going
to
yeah
he's
gonna
strike
the guy
right in
front of
him
his
hand
um
adds
a
you know
what
do
half
half of
the damage
so
pretty
good
for him
um
all right
so he
uh
hits that
guy
and
is
done
moved
croaked
intact
all right
more
goblins
to
this
one
is
gonna
run
up
to
um
karsten
and
he's
going
to
pull out
his
slicer
attack
attack
hit
for
two
points
of
damage
he's
gonna
attack
again
he's
gonna
miss
for
his
second
all
right
next
up
this
goblin
is
going
go
around
to
flank
prince
troubadour
see if
he can
cause
some
damage
here
miss
and
miss
all right
these
goblins
are
struggling
they're on
the struggle
bus here
they're gonna
this one's
gonna run
up and
flank
karsten
he's
going to
attack
attack
like the
other one
like that
i defend
it
you
they
he missed
by one
yeah
because you
had your
shield up
good job
nice
just
just so you
know
and he
missed the
other one
the other
one missed
as well
all right
well that
was uh
that was a
lot of
a lot of
swinging
without a
lot of
action
there
this guy
he's going
to run
up
and we
are at
the end
or we're
at our
time so
we are
refreshing
everybody's
hero points
back to
one
and he's
going this
guy is
going to
attack
kahir
a little
bit of an
easier time
at it
now
with
hits
or
one
point of
damage
next
one
swing
and
miss
all right
you're at
the top
of the
round
this guy
he's going
to
decide that
he liked
shooting
better
so he's
going to
move away
and he's
going to
shoot
Prince
Troubadour
he's not
going to
be able to
roll to
save his
life
I'm going
to be right
back also
okay
and we'll
wait for
everybody to
return
no we
won't
all right
kahir you're
up then
let's do
some striking
all right
oh that's a
critical
is it
yep
wow
72 points
of damage
what
holy
crap
72
dude
you gotta
come up
with
something
for how
you
decimated
this
goblin
I mean
you did
he might
not be
there
anymore
his body
might have
disappeared
somehow
it must
have
you did
72 points
of damage
to a
creature
that has
six
I think
I hit
him so
hard
I hit
the ground
through him
and he
went into
the ground
and disappeared
the ground
just opens
up underneath
him and
you create
this
crazier
nice
okay
I love
it
yeah
yeah
that sounds
about right
next up
for your
next trick
now if
I'm hitting
a new
person
it's still
my second
swing right
I have to
take the
negative
five
yep
yep
roll over
that one
yeah
that's
just a
hit
excellent
damage
him
likely
enough
right
yep
um
yeah
again
same
basic
thing
um
he
he
yeah
he only
had
four
guys
only had
six hit
points
to start
um
okay
so what's
what's
your third
action
there
here
hmm
I can't
really do
anything
because I
have two
hands on
my axe
um
let's
I don't
see
Prince
Troubadour
in the
thing
oh there
he is
right here
yeah I
see him
I was
looking at
what turn
he was
to flank
his guy
I'm gonna
say if
you put
yourself
there
you would
have him
flanked
but that's
I'm not
standing in
the water
there am
I
you
if
you're
in the
red
um
if you're
um
if you
step
back
you'll
be in
the
water
if you
step
forward
you won't
be in
the
water
Akir's
not in
the water
that's not
in the
water
no
as we'll
go there
and be
done
okay
nice
all right
Alwer
oh
you're surrounded
by carnage
and death
yeah
um
well
this is
uh
all going
rather
quickly
uh
I don't
necessarily
think
we need
to do
a whole
lot of
special
sauce
here
so we're
just gonna
keep it
simple
and we're
gonna cast
electric arc
on these
two
all right
and
we have
one success
and
two successes
all right
well it's not
great
they both
succeeded
but
yeah
four hole
damage
that's not
great
all right
well
um
for my
final
action
I will
each
took
four
yeah
yeah
um
how does
this work
oh yeah
next okay
oh yeah
oh yeah
that's how
that works
uh
sure
let's do
that
where
is
these guys
in the turn
order
that one
is after
karstid
that one
is also
after karstid
uh
that guy
is
there
okay
well
I don't
know if it's
gonna matter
much
but we're
gonna target
this guy
here
uh
the one
to the south
of karstid
uh
but I'm
gonna use
another
of my
new feats
I don't
think I've
used yet
excuse me
um
and it
is
where is
it
uh
it's called
distracting
performance
uh
so I'm
going to
create a
diversion
uh
but I'm
going to
create a
diversion
with
performance
rather than
uh
deception
where
so
when I
go into
the
actions
thing
like the
sword
actions
button
yep
they don't
actually have
act
like I
click on it
it just
brings up
the thing
it's not
really uh
action per
se but
that's
alright
uh
okay
uh
performance
nope
it's not
there
it's probably
gonna be
okay
under
deception
we'll just
have to
we'll just
have to
do
why
okay
yes
create a
diversion
I would
like
to
do
that
click
on
create a
diversion
I'll
open up
the
create a
diversion
thing
yeah
yeah
a gesture
trick
or some
distracting
words
you can
create a
version
so you
just need
to roll
your
performance
and then
well we
can apply
either
yep
yep
uh
yes
skills
performance
let's do
that
that is
odd
and that is
ocelot
oof
this is
versus
their
perception
just
perception
so
probably
I don't
succeed
I would
imagine
but maybe
uh
perception
dc
oh yeah
you got
him
okay
excellent
cool
cool
cool
uh
so
the other
thing
that
distracting
performance
does
is
normally
when you
create a
diversion
it makes
you
hidden
to the
creature
but with
distracting
performance
I can
make
somebody
else
hidden
to the
creature
so like
I'm
playing my
my loot
a little
bit
and I
am
distracting
this
guy
away
from
karsten
and so
until
the end
of
karsten's
turn
karsten
is
hidden
from that
guy
oh man
okay
which among
other things
means he's
off guard
yeah
that's my
turn
all right
awesome
um
okay
so we're
going to
we're moving
on to
another
goblin
warrior
who's
going
this is
one of
the guys
has been
standing in
the back
shooting
and continue
to stand
in the back
and shoot
not dog
slicer
guys
he's
shooting
let's
still
miss
all right
um
so he
basically
wastes
three arrows
trying to
shoot at
kahir
but he's
apparently
kahir is
extremely
intimidating
um
having
opened up
the ground
on two
goblins
that
just
just
moments
ago
so he's
shaking in
his boots
as he's
trying to
shoot him
this guy
is going
to run
up
he's
going
to
he wants
some frog
legs
for dinner
doesn't
he
place
a cone
and
targets
everybody
in there
whoa
whoa
that's a
cool effect
yeah
that's
really neat
and
we're
we're going
we're going
we're going
to
place the cone
we need the
targets to
make
oh
that's
not what I
wanted
um
so I
need
um
I need
kahir
to make
a
good roll
okay
oh that was
actually
roar
did succeed
so we'll go
ahead and
roll damage
yeah
so
here
you take
half
um
the goblin
will take
half
and die
oh
he killed
your buddy
oh he was
already
he was already
dead he just
didn't know it
yet
and prince
jubador takes
the full
monty
of burning
hands
and
that
was
the
spellcasting
goblins
turn
now
Samir
you're up
oh
hmm
that's
that might
hmm
hmm
spellcasting
goblin
now it's time
for the spellcasting
elf
yes
seems
appropriate
oh
uh
I'm gonna
move myself
here into
the line
of fire
that's
this guy
uh
where are
you
a lot of
people are
dying
yeah
maybe
this guy
is gonna
step
when you
get
next to
him
he's gonna
what
he's gonna
step
goblins
have a
reaction
ability
to
make a
five foot
step
when you
end your
turn next
to them
so that's
what he's
gonna do
like
I'm not
feeling it
not
feeling it
huh
we're gonna
target this
guy
there we go
and we're gonna
do that
guy
yeah let's
do that
and then
oh yeah
thank you
yeah
we're gonna do
that
and I need
to
attack
attack
um
so this
is an
attack
the
um
rageous
anthem
will apply
it should be
turned on
I don't
yeah I
don't see
the
icon
on my
guy
but
yeah
okay
um
we'll
attack
yeah just
add a
plus one
to your
attack
in the
dialogue
just
add a
plus one
to it
okay
I think
we are
good
oh
look at
that
not
not the
worst roll
I've had
yeah
better than
a five
do you
do you
wish to
use a
hero point
um
hmm
I
probably
you guys
have already
missed out
on
on one
hero point
this
this game
so
we roll
hero point
oh
three plus
ten is
thirteen
that's a
substantial
improvement
which is
indeed
a hit
anyway
all right
and flurry
of claws
targets
two
people
correct
oh
you got
those
two
yep
yeah
I just
had the
sudden
realization
like oh
wait I need
to check
and make
sure it's
not like a
three action
spell it's
not so I'm
good
um
so I target
those two
I'll just
I roll
damage and it
is what it
is yeah
yep
no plus
ones on
this one
uh no
uh just
the
courageous
anthem is
anthem is
just four
attacks not
damage
one and
seven and
one and
two a lot
of ones out
there on the
field guys
right so
you do
eleven points
of lightning
damage
which kills
one the
the guy
that was
over by
karsten
yeah he's
not being
flanked
anymore
karsten
good job
um and
the other
one does
take a
significant
amount of
damage
um and
because you
used your
draconic
magic you
get your
draconic
blood magic
effect on
there so
now you
get a plus
one status
bonus for
your ac
um for
having done
that um
how do
you want to
have killed
the creature
your with
your draconic
claws
rip and
rend
um yeah
just kind
of like
he just
like raises
both hands
up and
then yeah
he just
kind of
just raking
the the
bad guys
like from
the ground
up
okay and
it's and
these are
these like
spectral claws
or are they
like what
what what
okay
yep very
cool
glowing like
glowing a
specific color
or white
right
yep it's
kind of
almost like
uh misty
yeah yeah
yeah since
your since
your mother's
a cloud dragon
yeah yeah
like a
poofy smoky
claws come out
it's kind of
like just
rising up
out of the
ground and
these guys
get an inch
taller for a
second
all right
cool
that's
awesome
all right
now we've
got the
tripki
going to
run up
and he's
going to
attack
samir
um
with his
dagger
samir is
probably
what is
wrong with
you dude
thank you
oh
he misses
but when
he does
when he
does prince
troubadour
uses his
flash of
grandeur
um
so an
enemy
oh
damages
it's not
attacks
it's
damage
um
so he
misses with
his first
attack
but he
is going
to attempt
a second
i i don't
know if
you're seeing
this jason
i'm seeing
that your
blood magic
saved my
butt
yeah that's
exactly what
just happened
i am
i am so
sad right
now this
is going
to be
awesome
but it
no that's
good on
you i
love it
like i
love it
when these
sorts of
things happen
where it's
like because
you got this
super special
bonus here
you go you
you you averted
this terrible
catastrophe and
you did
um so
good and
i'm glad to
avert a
catastrophe
i mean
yeah you
don't want
to have
those catastrophes
they're just
i was afraid i
was gonna have
to flicker out
of reality for
a minute
yeah
so this
skeleton all
of a sudden
gets a burst
of speed
runs up
here and
it's gonna
target
carson
and take
its great
axe and
see if it
can cleave
him in
two
he's
oh
well he
carson is
currently
hidden from
the goblin
but not
hidden from
the skeleton
right
ramsey
correct
correct
um so
he does
hit
um
does hit
carson
for
16
points
of
damage
what
oh
he's
he's a
he's a
big bag
he's
big
big
bad
whatever it
is that
dave says
um
and he
is going
to try
and take
a second
attack
and miss
with that
second one
but his
first attack
it's
solidly
um
and
ringing
karsten's
bell
it most
definitely
does
yeah you
guys were
just used
to dealing
with goblins
you you
didn't think
that there
were big
big big
bad guys
in here
um
all right
speaking of
karsten
you are
up
all right
i'm gonna
whack the
guy behind
me
well
park
i i
would like
to remind
you that
you do
have
this um
do have
a certain
ability
called
um
quick
reversal
well
there
it is
whack
it is
whack-a-mole
but uh
the technical
term is
quick
reversal
which allows
you to
attack two
enemies
on either
side of
you with
the same
attack bonus
so you can
attack
um
make a melee
strike against
one of the
flanking enemies
and make a
second with
the same
weapon
or unarmed
attack against
a different
enemy that's
flanking you
the second
strike is the
same multiple
attack penalty
as the
initial attack
so when
you are
flanked you
get to
stab both
of the
guys with
the same
um
with the
same attack
bonus and
it costs
you one
action
oh
nice
so
all right
so if i
want to do
if i want to
do double
slice
i do
that twice
uh
double
slice
um
i would
need to
give me
one second
to see if
it's a
one action
or a
two action
i mean i
don't really
need it
for the
goblin
but it
is two
but if i
use it
on the
sorry
yeah so
the since
it is a
two action
ability
um
you
are
you would
not be
able to
do it
twice
within the
within the
same combat
turn because
you only have
three actions
to work
with
um
i'd have to
just use a
regular
go ahead
just a
regular
strike
right
right
so you
could double
slice and
then do a
regular strike
yeah
oh
well let's
just do that
or you could
do the
quick reversal
and
um
well the
thing with
double slices
it still
counts as
two attacks
so your
third attack
is going to
be at a
negative 10
penalty
so
oh
okay
well let's
do the
just a
regular one
and just do
the reversal
or whatever
okay
well either
way like
basically double
slice is really
good if you're
wanting to
like
so
really you've
got two
pretty good
options here
and i'm sorry
i'm taking
so much time
here but
um
you can either
double slice
against the
big
the big
uh
undead
creature
which
is a
really good
option for
maybe taking
that thing
out completely
um
or you could
do the
quick reversal
which would
allow you
to hit
that guy
but also
hit the
goblin
behind you
and maybe
take the
goblin out
but you
probably still
have the
undead
creature to
contend with
so i guess
okay
um so
when you
double slice
um
there is a
little play
button next
to the double
slice if you
click that
or the
use button
it'll pop
up a
dialogue
um
yep
well i
just
and when
you
um
and so
when you
click it
it has
like the
first attack
and then the
second attack
it's got
drop downs
for those
i have to
get a
weapon
i thought
i had a
weapon
um
all right
this should
not be
you do
have a
weapon
all right
well it said
i didn't
have a
weapon
well you
haven't you
haven't chosen
a weapon
yet so look
at the double
slice dialogue
do you see
that
there's no
dialogue it
just goes
oh first
attack
i see
first attack
like winter's
dawn is your
first attack
okay then
second attack
click your
plus one
striking shield
spikes
oh really
yep
and then
no and
then the
multiple attack
penalty is that
no map because
this is your
first attack
and click on
the attack
button and
it'll run
all the damage
for you
or all the
attacks and
damage
all right
so your
first attack
um with
winter's dawn
you hit
your second
attack with
your plus one
striking shield
spikes you
crit
yeah
oh
okay
and
a little
damage for
your shield
spikes
nice
and
let's see
is it
was that
crit damage
that you have
there or is
that regular
damage
i don't know
oh that's
regular damage
okay so i'll
just double it
so okay
you're you did
30 points of
damage with
your shield
and you did
17 points of
damage with
winter's dawn
and that's
not bad
which was
enough to
defeat that
guy
um
all right
and i got a
little goblin
right
yep
i'm gonna
so if you
want to turn
around and
try and whack
him you've
got to use
your multiple
attack penalty
three on
that i lied
uh can i
even if i
blaze him
with fire
oh you
want to
try and
do do
your uh
yeah is
that still
a negative
10
no it's
not actually
it's a
template
so um
so on
your infernal
breeze
gauntlets
you just
want to
click on
the area
fire dc
21
yeah
there you
go
and then
i will go
ahead and
boom
have
the goblin
yeah
fail
the attack
so roll
damage
my man
for um
you do
26 points
of damage
to that
goblin
oh
i thought
i just
did 13
oh
boom
it uh
it
crit
failed
he's gonna
be roasted
toasty
right
he's all
warmed up
yeah
okay clark
i think you're
officially in
in the in
the stage of
not being able
to be like
here does
all of the
damage
you have a
pile of dead
bodies around
you dude
i think you
done real
good here
i mean
granted
kahir did
do 72
points of
damage with
one swing
but
oh
that was a
crit
um
prince
troubadour
is going
to
um
going to
see if
he can
defeat
the
spell
casting
goblin
he hits
he's going
to hit
again
or attempt
to hit
again
miss
in his
third action
he's going
to
miss
all right
so prince
troubadour
pulls out
his
his
uh
little
axe
thing
and
starts
whacking
at this
flaming
goblin
but
um
is unable
to
complete
destroy
um
this goblin
he's already
backed up
he's kind
of
you see
in the
direction
that things
are going
he's
gonna
go
this
way
that's
what he's
doing
he's not
stupid
here you're
up
oh no
so as
far as
like things
that are
like oh
here i'll
clean stuff
up here so
you can
have a little
bit
i can't see
myself
you got in
one of those
dead guys
who's now
flying away
i'm moving
i'm moving
i'm moving
pogs out
of the way
so you can
see what
you're just
going to
heaven
that's
all
up into
the sky
what's
left
bye
okay
so
you've got
this undead
creature right
here
you've got
this guy
here
and you've
got this
guy here
i can't
move
behind this
dude because
it's dark
uh
you there
that there's
a trunk there
a trunk there
okay
yeah
oh i can't
move there
either
yeah you
there
either
yeah
let's see
um let me
see if i can
figure out
where the
walls are
so i can
direct you
around them
um
no i think
i got him
how many are
left
there's
really there's
this undead
creature that
you're literally
standing right
next to
yeah
kill it
please
and then
go there
that's it
hit him
he's kind
of scary
kill it
he is
he is scary
you do hit
him
which guy
good
this undead
dude
oh right
there
medium undead
that's the worst
role ever
17 points
of damage
you know
i think my
highest for the
nice 11
dude
that was your
worst role
ever
oh when he
gets a plus
10 to damage
you know
i know right
he did
hold a one
and
oh it
doesn't
doesn't appear
to be
no
no
this is
this is not a
goblin
you don't
one-shot
unless you
crit
he's just
seen better
days
yeah
he's still
a long way
one-shot
either way
not how this
game works
all right
you hit
full damage
that's real
better damage
this time
i mean
you still
did pretty
good damage
nine
six
that's a
better
roll
that's
yeah
a lot
that
damage
my friend
enough
without
pretty
make you
fly away
oh my
god
no stand
here
help
up
his
troubadour
okay
all done
all right
now we're
you're up
all right
well
uh
yeah let's
uh let's
try this
out
um
it was a
slightly
different
cantrip
i chose
i had
access to
uh
slashing
gust
um i
actually get
to make an
attack
against both
these guys
so let's
do that
um so
the uh
blade kind
of uh as
i'm singing
and uh
and playing
uh kind
of glows
and then
like the
wind picks
up um
and around
these two
uh remaining
goblins in
particular like
it seems to
like literally
slash at them
and try to
cut into their
skin
uh let's
see what we
can do here
ah that's
not very
good
that sounds
like a
hero point
that looks
much better
way better
yeah
yeah
that seems
like a
critical hit
well that
is a
critical hit
yeah
um
how
do
i
there's
no i
don't see
an option
to make
well i
can just
well we'll
just double
it afterwards
i suppose
uh oh
except stuff
happens on a
crit with
this
um
yeah
no you
you crit
with both
ones so
okay
uh hang
on
let's
i mean
i don't
know what's
going to
matter
to be
honest
because it
does bleed
on a
okay
on a
crit too
uh so
i see it
on here so
if they
survive i'll
i'll throw
the bleed
on
yeah
yeah
and
okay
yep
cool
oh
they probably
survive
well the
one guy
probably does
the one
guy maybe
not
that's just
rude
right
oh
that's what
i'm saying
um
i hear
just really
quickly when
you
when you
attacked
the
um
frog
uh the
frog
has it
in its
death
throw
actually
did
attack
you
back
um
so
we'll do
that and
then i'll
resolve
ramsey's
thing
or ramsey's
thing
sorry about
that
so
so
he
hits
goo
here
takes
20
damage
and
um
i need
kihir
to make
hook
on
button
i'm gonna
throw
i need
kihir to
make a
fortitude
saving
throw
this was
after i
hit him
first but
he didn't
die
no this
was when
you killed
him
oh
okay so
you did
succeed on
the saving
throw
which
means that
nothing
terrible
has
except you
take 20
points of
damage
which means
you've seen
better days
at this point
right
well yeah
so you took
a ton of
damage
um
but you
also don't
have a
corrupting
spite to
deal with
anymore
or you
don't have
a corrupting
spite to
deal with
which is a
good thing
but yeah
no he
he did
do a
do
do a
thing
all right
so we'll
get now
flashback
forward to
our and
his uh
and his
amazing
gusts of
damage
um so
uh they
both take
uh wait
go back
um
you
criticaled
on that
so we're
going to
double
and double
damage
double
damage
no
excellent
didn't
get
both
oh
yeah
so
i'll
have to
worry
about
figuring
out
the
bleed
damage
on that
yep
yep
yep
yep
cool
uh
there's
just that
one dude
running
away
that's
like
hate
anything
about
that
if i
wanted
to
so
like
that's
all i
got
all
right
all
right
all right
samir
uh
there's
like
ramsey
said
there's
a guy
who
there's
a goblin
that's
about
95 feet
away
from you
and he's
on the
run
that's
the only
thing
that's
left
oh
really
95
feet
95
feet
do you
have a
spell
that
reaches
that
yeah
of course
yeah
i do
i can't
see the
dude
though
uh
you'll
need to
move
north
like
if you
go
if you
go up
like
probably
to
about
here
you'll
be able
to see
him
because
he's
over
here
i do
actually
see him
from where
i'm
standing
oh
well
there you
go
now
i just
i just
couldn't
i wasn't
scrolled
out
far
enough
you
little
turd
um
keep
me
running
yeah
that's
no good
i don't
want to
do
that
um
i would
need to
make a
full
move
and
i don't
have
enough
actions
to do
that
so i
won't
be doing
that
that won't
work
i guess
it's just
this one
this is
the way
to do
it
i don't
see
anyone
i will
move my
30 feet
to
there
i guess
i'm not
moving
there
yeah
there
there are
some
walls
that are
in the
way
so you're
gonna have
to just
navigate
around
them
oh
it's got
me locked
in as
though i
were moving
or something
already
all right
so
stop it
i'll try
pressing escape
all right
it's
it's not
letting me
do it
it's not
happy
about
that
where are
you wanting
to go
just let
me know
and i'll
move you
if i can
get up
around over
here
somewhere
just like
to kind
of close
that
distance
around
that
yeah
i mean
that
looks like
it's
too far
right
i don't
think i
moved
quite that
fast
yeah
just going
to
under
strike
range
of
120
yeah
all right
so he's
going to
attempt
a
he's going
to attempt
a
bc20
basic
reflex
does
succeed
he doesn't
crit
succeed
so roll
damage
oh my
gosh
low average
and well
below
average
oh my
god that's
ridiculous
oh
oh
waste
of time
all right
that was
your action
that was
all my
actions
yeah
yeah
karsten
i don't
think you
got anything
long-ranged
no
what about
your blasting
beams what's
the range on
those things
the what
your blasting
beam beams
your eye lasers
oh
blasting
beams
30 feet
uh
i think
that's the
means as a
action activity
can go up to
60 feet
yeah
oh
now
he's
100 feet
oh
yeah
yeah
you don't
have
yeah you've
got
you got
movement
25
yeah
um
so even
if you were
able to move
in a direct
straight line
you'd only be
able to get
to like
either
85 feet
75
yeah
yeah
now
somebody
if you had
movement
bonuses
yeah
that's the
next thing
but i don't
know how to
do that
like
it's not a
spell
right
no
it's not
it's it's
just an
action
okay
use an
action
and then
you use
the warp
reality action
in there
and then you
drop a
and then you
drop a
template
um
and that
template will
um
allow anybody
who moves
through or
it'll basically
drop a circle
and whoever
moves through
that circle
um
that's an ally
gets a plus
five
to their
movement
speed
everybody
who's an
enemy
it's a negative
five to their
movement speed
so
okay
yeah i was
thinking i'm
thinking about
that i'm like
man i just i
didn't know how
to do it all
right so now
i don't know
how to do
it i think
right right
i see it
good all
right and
yeah and i
didn't even
think about it
until clark was
like i can't
get anywhere
close to him
i was like
oh man
right no
i'm thinking
about it i
just um
wasn't sure
how to make
that happen
ultimately the
question is do
we want to
chase a guy
down and
hope he
leads us
back to
his camp
or
yeah so
basically at
this point
like um
i would
say that
uh
alwar do you
have anything
that that
has um
that has a
range of
like um
i mean right
now he's gonna
he's gonna do
a full move
when i don't
think i can do
anything to get
him
yeah because
oh it's a
triple move
he's using all
of his actions
to run
so that's
75 feet
that he's
going to
move next
turn
all of us
can do that
right
yeah everybody
can do that
but nobody
will be able
to like you
you're not
going to be
able to
make any
progress on
him so
pretty much
what what's
what's going
to happen
here is
either um
either you
guys choose
to just let
him go
and um
that kind
of thing
or if you
do try to
pursue um
we'll need
to transition
to um
and this is
obviously for
next time
because we are
at the end
of our our
time today
but um
we would need
to transition
to a chase
scene um
because you're
not going to
be able to
resolve this
in combat
unless you've
got like a
300 foot
range spell
that can take
him out or
something
no the best
I can do
is 240
240 might
still be
within range
um
as a matter
of fact
jason
if you
did want
to use
that to
that 240
foot range
spell
I'll just
let you
I'll just
let you run
it um
like give
it give
it a go
um ramsey
likewise if you
have something
that's got that
kind of range
um I'll just
let you guys
make the roll
because I don't
think karsten
or kahir will
be able to do
make that kind
of range
at this
point
yeah most
definitely I
cannot
so we'll
we will just
go out of
combat and
let you guys
make your
make your
uh last
spell checks
to see if you
can uh
see if you
can hit him
um before he
disappears
oh you know
what I
I might have
lied
oh I
did
uh it's
150
foot's the
best I
can do
I guess
what about
the range
but it
adds it
30
oh okay
okay
so
um yeah
because right
now I'm
60 he
goes 75
right
yeah
yeah
like we
would we
will assume
that he's
going to
move up
50 from
where he
is now
if you
are moving
and moving
and attacking
yeah
um
so
because you
guys can
keep up
with you
you guys
can move
and then
cast a
spell
um
so it
would
Jason for
you it
would pretty
much be the
same as if
you had done
a reach spell
so either
way
um so he's
going up by
75
actually I
don't have a
spell but I
do have a
short bow
um
and that's
got a range
for that
get it
with
penalty but
yeah
okay
well then
let's do
it
all right
uh
this guy's
got a 25
land speed
yes
right
yeah
I don't
know
like I
think most
of us
have got
30
Alwar might
be able
no
no
no
every
everybody
everybody
with
the
exception
of
I'm
the
I'm
the one
who's
got a
30
well
Kahir has
a 35
but that's
because
Kahir is
a
barbarian
um
he would
be at
25
25
is the
natural
land speed
that will
do it
wow
all right
roll
damage
wow
that's an
awesome
roll
good job
four
great
but it
is just
a goblin
son of a
bitch
he didn't
make it
he has
one hit
point left
excellent
oh my
gosh
are you
kidding me
hit him
jason
jason
figure it
out jason
we got
hilarious
okay so
let's see
where you
are you
are there
he's 80
feet in
front of
you now
before you'll
be able to
act again
he'll be
another 75
feet out
so what's
that
mental math
plus 75
okay that's
155 feet
the range
of your
is 120
is 120
if i
move my
full 30
he could
move 30
i can i
can move my
full 30 or
i can stand
there and
increase it by
30 feet
either way
yep
doesn't
matter
125
is it
125
yeah
does anybody
have any
way of
like
pushing
um
pushing
samir by
five feet
yes
because if
somebody can
move him
makes an
action but
yeah
yeah
actually
though
i lied i
cannot
okay
because if
somebody can
move him
five feet
he can get
within range
to to make
the thunder
strike again
right
how many
actions is
the thunder
strike
two
actions
everything i
have is
well
it's 120
feet
it's 120
feet range
so he
literally
samir just
needs a
push
right
yeah all
the spells
are two
actions
so restrictive
right
right
right
yep
okay
yep
yeah i
got nothing
there the
best i
could do
would be
the now
that i
have the
bow out
to double
move and
shoot again
uh
but
that
it's gonna
be at an
even bigger
penalty
uh
i don't know
okay
but i have no
way to move
you jason
i thought i
did but i
do not
clark
i can't
what do you
want me to
do
i'm too
far away
here hear me
out buddy
hear me out
um i know
he's 30 feet
out but we
just need
you to be
able to get
to him so
you can double
move and get
to him
you have an
ability that's
a free action
called aggressive
block
um
well actually
like you don't
even need to
use that
you just need
to you just
need to use
the shove
action
well how do
i do that
um so
go ahead and
target
samir
and then
in the
whole in the
uh shaking
hands
um
thing click
on that
to pull up
the basic
actions
and there's
a shove
action
and uh
at the top
of the
fourth column
shove plus
10
typically this
is an
attack
but
what
i mean
typically
shove is an
attack but
i wouldn't
necessarily
consider it
to be
oh my gosh
uh
i'm gonna
use my
hero point
what do i
do
uh if you
right click
on the uh
right click
on the
chat thing
that has the
failing
the the
failure in
there
there there's
a re-roll
with hero point
oh my gosh
there you go
oh my gosh
i threw you
across the
whole plane
so you
critically
succeed in
the shove
um
so you
push the
target
um
okay
so on
success
you push the
target five
feet
um
on a
critical
success
you push
the target
ten feet
and you
can stride
after it
um
so you
can basically
running
shove him
but that
will be
enough
to get
samir
in 115
feet away
from the
goblin
to
run
to
throw out
a thunder
strike
um
and
hopefully
as long
he does
not save
well
as long
as he
doesn't
critically
succeed
which he
didn't
he just
regular
succeeded
roll
damage
took some
good
bludgeoning
damage
that
drops him
and some
good lightning
damage
you did
you did
good damage
on that
one
all right
yeah
thanks
thanks
yeah
yeah
sorry
sorry
not trying
to get
people to
no
like
it's fun
to kind
of work
through all
that stuff
and see
how it
goes
if
if I
need it
I could
I could
catch him
um
I can
move five
feet faster
than he
can I
can take
an action
and do
my uh
you know
time warp
thing
oh yeah
speed myself
up
or slow
him down
and
even you
know then
he would
he would run
out 70
feet and I
could still
go 60
um
on two
actions so
I I could
I could have
begun to reel
him in it
would just
take time
yeah okay
well um
so we'll go
ahead and
so you
you chase
after him
and I
know that
your intention
with this
with this
last goblin
was to
knock it
out and
capture it
right
yeah well
I mean
I'm kind
we're kind
of looking
for information
how do we
get where
we got to
go right
right
let's either
do a chase
scene and
figure out
you know
hope he takes
us home
so yeah
so so
that and
that's fine
um so
you even
though you
were using
a combat
spell against
him um I'm
gonna say that
you were able
to knock him
out because
that really
was your
intention um
so you
have an
unconscious
goblin on
your hands
um and
let me go
ahead and
end the
combat here
uh
counter
counter
uh
auto
assign
huh
yeah for
some reason
Samir you're
not counting
as a player
character I'm
gonna need to
figure out what's
going on with
that
why all of
those
yeah
that's why that
wasn't applying
yeah exactly
493
looks like you
guys are
getting a
little bit of
snow right
now
uh
yeah
all right
um so you
you successfully
knock out
knock
goblin out
um everybody
it's uh
233 xp
from the
encounter
um which
puts you
guys a
little under
half
for your
next uh
for your
next level
um
cool
and
uh
i think
that's i
think that's
that's where
where we'll
end it for
today so
we'll go
ahead and
head back
head back
into the
um
get back
to the
landing page
and
um
i know
we're i
know we're
about 20
minutes over
so i don't
want to keep
you guys up
here but
uh we'll
pick it back
up uh
two weeks
from now
does that
still work
for everybody
i believe
so
yep
let's check
my schedule
christmas
okay yeah
check your
schedule get
back with
me i know
that things
are a little
bit tricky
around this
time of
year but
um if
we can
you're going
nowhere and
doing nothing
i probably
won't be able
to make it
that night
okay
okay
we'll be
traveling to
the sum
that night
oh
yeah
yeah
one should
not
we do it
the night
before or
i could
i could
uh well
we can
yeah we
can we
can talk
about that
and see
if we
can work
get in
um
but
yeah so
we'll
we'll
maybe
maybe see
you guys
in about
two weeks
um
and uh
good
good combat

we'll
actually
get to
some
um
role playing
here next
time but
wanted you guys
