Alright. So Carson's gonna take how how many Three. How much lay on hands are you doing? Two lay on hands and a recharge. I think unless I it looks like everyone else is pretty good.

Unless I'm wrong. Very good. Well, that that's fine. I'm the only reason why I'm asking is I need to keep track of time here. So every time you recharge, that's ten minutes.

So I need to Yes. Make sure that I've got that correctly advancing because that affects special abilities and things that are on clocks and timers. And now Okay. All right. So I think that's pretty much what I've got so far.

You're you're seeing a bunch of boulders that were that you're certain are part of that used to be a part of buildings here. You have this boardwalk that's kind of just more of a, more of a track to kinda keep you guys to to keep travelers off of the, out of the water, and then you have access to those boats. Would I be able to see where the buildings were, like, in the water and be able to point to them from the boardwalk where we're standing? Oh, yeah. You you totally could.

And the and I should say, like, it's not like ruins. It's not something where you could point you you'd be like, this was, this sort of building. There's not really an outline of a building. You just see, like, rubble that used to be part of a building. Let me ask him what is he doing because I don't see nothing.

I'd point it out to you and say, do you think this could have been from the great whatever was that was called, the destruction that's on here over the whole Earth or land or whatever? Could have been. Or what have we stumbled upon? Go mama. What do you get what are you guys thinking?

Boardwalk or boats? Couple of bees. Yep. We, started down the boardwalk, so kinda been glad to keep going that way. But Right.

The only thing with the boats is we found, like, tracks or we saw tracks across, didn't we, where it was just, like, kinda like a pathway of tracks over the hill or something? I don't think so. I think you saw you saw a mooring at the other end. So, like, a place where the boat where the boat would have Was landed? Yeah.

Where it was landed. But, it didn't specifically see, like, you know, evidence of creatures recently moving moving around there, but it's pretty big lake. So there's a chance that you that there might be something over there. We put something in the water to see if it's acid burning, like, I think it's stress or something. Hot.

But yeah. We've we've got the floor lock standing there, and it's not disintegrating by Right. What appears to be acid. So, I mean, if I've got a simple dagger. Yeah.

I think Clark is stick the dagger in there and and see if that reacts with it. Okay. Use Grab a whole dagger. Dagger. Yeah.

Yeah. Grab a dagger, stick it in the water. Like the whole dagger or just the blade or or Just the tip of it. You know, an inch or two in maybe. That's the tip.

Alright. So, yeah, you put it in there. You don't you don't see any telltale signs of acid. So, like, there's no, like, instant steaming, or and the and the blade itself doesn't doesn't really change its composition at all. Although, like, you know, again, like, when you put your hand that close to the water, it's definitely like, you know, if you have had your hand, like, over a boiling pot, that's the that's the general, that's the general feel that you have with your hands so close to the water.

Gotcha. So pull the blade out and it's quite hot, but Right. No signs of falling. Yeah. Yeah.

I would recommend if you like your skin on, don't fall in. I'm good to walk down the boardwalk, but It does make one question. What the heck is going on here that this Right. Algae water can be that superheated? That's really intense.

Magma. Alright. Right. Yeah. Let's let's move on.

Okay. Okay. So you start moving moving continuing to move down the boardwalk. As you, like, find as you, like, finish with your assessment and everything, you start to look around, and you see something, in kind of, like, hiding in the reads, not quite in not quite in the marsh. But there's definitely something that's trying to hide from you, but is not doing so hot at that.

Tend not to notice. And it hasn't noticed that it it it seems to think it's doing a great job. It must be doing really bad then. So, I if you want to get a clearer look, I would say go ahead and roll a, roll of perception, but everybody notices this. It's not it it's not like only certain people notice.

Like, you you all notice. Okay. So what's doing real bad, right? Yeah. No, we'll see.

We'll see if I can get a better look. All right. I don't know if it's so good, but. Yeah. Well, it's, it's enough.

So I'll I'll worry. You see, it might not be an unfamiliar site. I don't know if you're I don't know if you're at all familiar with trees, with your bardic background and all this other stuff. But what you see is a anthropomorphic frog about your size. Okay.

It has piece mailed, piece mailed armor, like, more more akin to the more akin to, like, you know, plate armor than, than, like, leather armor. But it's definitely not it's definitely mismatched. Definitely and none of it was made for this creature. You see, like, goblin pieces as well as other other pieces that you're not terribly familiar with. It appears to be trying to hide in the reeds to you.

It doesn't doesn't appear to be doesn't appear to be trying to ambush you, but at the same time, it seems to be a little bit more wary. Sure. And that's basically, effectively what you see crouching the wreaths. Sick. Oh, I was thinking of the wreaths.

It looks kinda cool. And it's about my size, you said? It's about your size. Yeah. Is it holding any weapons?

It has a shield and a small thing that kind of looks like a pick slash axe. Uh-huh. But that's that's what it's that's what it's holding. Okay. Okay.

So it's holding it? Okay. It is it is armed, but it doesn't appear to be aggressive. Not in the water. It's kind of the reeds next to the Okay.

Didn't know. Like, off to the side, I imagine, of the boardwalk. Yeah. Right. Right.

Yeah. I'll, I'll I'll take, like, a couple of slow steps towards it, like, looking directly at it and, do my best for Obi Wan. Oh, hello there. Okay. I like it.

Okay. So once approach with my hands, you know, kind of in a neutral, not threatening, you know, kinda kinda thing. Okay. Once it, once it realizes that it's been, it's been made Yep. From my side.

It it, it jumps onto the boardwalk shield and hatchet thing in hand, and says, it is good that you found me. You must be you must be very skilled indeed. Oh, I am prince I like, like so? I am prince Troubadour. Who might you be?

Sorry. You caught out of a second there. Prince? Prince Troubadour. Troubadour.

Got it. Who might you be? Well, rather auspicious name. I'm Alwar. These are my friends.

And I'll kind of wave back if anyone wants to introduce themselves, but I won't do it for them. We are, well, hunting goblins. Oh. Well, you certainly came to the right place. There are plenty to be hunted.

Are you why are you hunting goblins? Are you friend or you foe? Oh, the goblins? Foe. They have attacked our village.

We are coming to make sure they're unable to do so ever again. Well, you are a foe of the goblins, then you are a friend of mine. That's good. I assume they've also caused you and your people trouble? Oh, so much.

They seem to think that they seem to think that they own the swamp just because they got here a few months before we did. We are we are at war with the with the goblin tribe, or I should say we are at war with the evil hags that control the goblin tribe, but they appear to follow their orders. Our, we were led here just about a year ago by, by Uvara, the great god of the hunt. And anybody who wants to know more about that without asking questions, they roll a knowledge religion if they so desire. Oh, yes.

I do. And I can find it. Champions. Knowledge somewhere in this oh, there it is. Got a 50.

Woah. Woah. Woah. Sub person. Do your turn.

I'm not sure if I really dug that. Okay. So, both Samir and Karsten, you know, Uvara is the, is, as he said, the god of the hunt. The he's often depicted as a tall, lean figure cloaked in shifting hues of dawn and dusk. His eyes are glowing with soft amber light that pierce through the darkness and, and deception.

And he's accompanied by a spectral hound and hawk made of and a hawk made of starlight. Is definitely about you know, kind of in encapsulates the hunt. Our what you know is that, not only that this deity is a deity that, doesn't really care about the meaning, doesn't care about the the end. It's more about the journey. It's about the hunt.

It's not about the quarry. And that's kind of, like, something that distinguishes this deity from, from, many of the others. It's less about, like, less about for the greater good and that kind of stuff. It's just more along lines of, I have a target. I wanna I want to find that target.

What is the guy's name again? Uvarra. Let me one second, and I will get that in the chat. Alright. Give me one second, guys.

Mhmm. What do we do with the frog guy? Well, if his people are at war with the goblins, we might have some allies. Yeah. No.

So that means there'd be more of them. That's what I'm hoping. And if, long term, that time cave stays, open and stable. If we ally with them, they can be good allies of our village. Mhmm.

Mhmm. Yeah. Putting together another little truce thing might be beneficial. Mhmm. It sounds like the hags are still well at work here, so I just think it would be a priority even if we can set the goblins free from their influence that.

It'd be more profitable than pulling off hundreds of goblins. Right. Does that say he's a trip key champion? Anybody know what that is? I don't see that.

If you double click on him. Oh, I gotcha. Could be the name of the the frog people. Trip key champion. Yep.

Trip key. No worries. Just wondered if he's, like, religious, like, Clark comes to him or Sort of like to follow the the hunt god. Yeah. Now how, you know, closely or how religious now, but because he's doing a bad job of hiding at the moment.

Yeah. He kind of, kinda bit that one. Yeah. Must have. Wonder why he was hiding.

Mhmm. Spying out the Clark so scared him. You scared him. I think he saw the big war that we were fighting. Right?

No. He saw a lot of great warriors walking down the the path. Yeah. You're a single dude. That's what you're gonna do.

Sounds right. That's right. Breaking into the boots. You're on boots. Hey, guys.

Sorry. Hey. No worries. Hey. Okay.

So, okay. So, yeah, that he he he responded with, you know, told you that, his his people had been, led here by the great god, Ovara. He is, he is, happy, to have allies that are that are against, goblins as the goblins have been a pain in his side for a while. And, yeah. So you guys have any responses?

Do you have any I mean, are you are there more of you here or how many? Oh, yes. There are there are many of us. Are you all equipped? You have weapons?

I'll be equipped with weapons. Of course, we have weapons. We're at war. Why wouldn't we be why wouldn't we have weapons? Good.

Sure. Who's that? Does he know where the goblins are? That's a great question. He he does not give you the impression that he knows exactly where they are.

And our, I would like you to make a, both a society. Well, actually anybody who's got society can roll that or a part acknowledge from from our sec. I was gonna say one of those things I have society, you said? Yeah. Oh, I got society.

Boom. Right. I think that you both, you both got got this. Trip key, which is what the which is what this creature is, are known to have more of a native, more of a native, no. Not native.

Tribal. They they're known to have more of a more of a tribal society and tribal, tribal sort of feel to them. They are they're known for having, not having, like, complex armor. They're primarily scouts and, barbarians and that kind of thing. So, the, the shield that he holds is more is a well crafted, is well crafted leather shield.

The hatchet thing that he has is a is a more well crafted hatchet. The armor appears to be weird, but a tripty running around in armor in of itself, like non hide armor is just odd. Also, they don't typically have names like Troubadour. Okay. That last bit, I think, is more of an outward thing than a, than a Karsten thing.

So the naming convention, you probably don't know, but I worry you do. Okay. Okay. So he's a little little different. Excellent.

So that might mean I mean, is he like different, like, special different or, like, mentally handicapped different? You know what I mean? You well, you don't know. Okay. Yeah.

He's just different. To me, that sounds like his people, wherever they are, are not necessarily all tripty. Like, he may be, okay. You know, like I like I am. You know, the one that was in the village.

Oh, okay. So you're a little different too. Yeah. I'd say, well, how how, if you guys are at war with the goblins, we would like to to maybe help as much as we can, because that's our goal too. We come to this place.

We have the backing of our village. But while we're here, it's just the four of us, digging those hags out as well, I think you've come to know. It's a pretty big job. Yeah. Oh, yes.

Oh, yes. Yes. We have yet to have been able to, we've yet to have been able to do it. It's a big conflict. They they are they are well guarded.

Well, if you are here too, I would ask you to join me in a in a quest. What? Oh, what, what kind of quest? You see, I had What? The Holy Grail.

You see, I had four, four myself and four compatriots were sent from the sent from the tribe to, defeat two ghouls that had been entering into our territory. There are lots of undead here. Many, many undeads. But these ones were getting too close to the village, so they sent us to go and, to go and take care of them. We were well matched to handle two ghouls, but there was a white as well, and we were not well matched for the white.

I was the only one who was able to survive. Well And I would ask, if you are if you are as big and brave and strong as I've seen as I've seen, I think that you might be able to assist me in, defeating the ghouls and the wight. Do you accept this quest? If we do this for you, will you, take us back to your people? Introduce us to your leaders?

I will. I would be glad to meet other strong adventurers. Ah, yes. He did say prince, didn't he? I'll kinda look back at the rest of everybody else and kinda make a shrug and say, what do you think?

My facial expression is like, what? That's not our mission, but, obviously, it wouldn't be bad to help. So But you love dealing with undead. I mean, yes. You're particularly specialized at it.

I mean, I get that. But also, I'm also, gold, and I like I'm staying on task here, and I'm having a hard time staying on task. I mean, that's any side quests happen. Right? I know.

Yeah. Yeah. That's I mean, it I think it will be good because we'll need them for the other battles coming up. So it's great. Yeah.

And their knowledge and everything. Yeah. Yep. I agree. What's what's a white?

What's a white? That is a really good question. Anybody with knowledge and religion, feel free to roll some beautiful bean footage as far as I see. I'm coming. And just knowledge religion.

Is that just the religion one? Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's the religion skill and or, big part of knowledge counts for anger and everything here. So Yeah.

Yeah. It's designed to be the touch of knowledge skill. Apparently. Oh. I am I am not very great.

Okay. Job, Kihir. Kihir is very talented at knowing things. Mhmm. Why is all my stuff secret?

Secret secret. You Got it. Might be out of secret. Secret. Because you're rolling knowledge checks.

If you do a recall knowledge check, it's automatically a secret role because technically, you're not supposed to know whether or not you succeeded or what your role was. Because if you roll poorly enough, then I can give you false information. Oh, you didn't. Like, if you could fail it, then I can I can insert bad information, and you wouldn't know? No.

I'd be totally because it's secret. So because I'm stupid. Alright. So we'll start off with Carson. You know, that a wight is a powerful undead creature.

It you know, that's that's pretty much what you know. Okay. Like, do I know what kind of creature though? You know what I mean? Like, wraith or, a lot, you know, pick, pick, pick.

Like like that? Or is it Well, white is a category. Oh, okay. Yeah. Okay.

So the white category is I t h t. I'm just trying to get a picture of what the heck this thing looks like. Well, it kinda looks like a zombie with glowing eyes, but it runs. Oh, okay. So it's a glowing eyed zombie thing.

Bastion zombie. Okay. Here. Yeah. Yeah.

That's zombie. Okay. Alright. I've also known the whites to be incorporeal, but these are different. Alright.

So, as far as I know, these ones aren't incorporeal. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. What's what's incorporeal?

Like a ghost. Oh, okay. Samira, you know that plus whites are rumored to, whites are rumored to be, to have some sort of, like, curse thing that it does. Power flow undead that curses things is what Samir knows. Alright.

Our you know those things plus, you know that, a white is a, it's an intelligence, it's an intelligent, undead. It's not it's not mindless like a zombie. Mhmm. And, its curses, are, it's curses referred to as spikes. And as you are, and, curses are inflicted by, by a physical attack.

Okay. Go here. You know all those things. Plus, you know if a wight kills something, then that thing will ray will rise again and become the wights' servant and maybe someday eventually become a wight itself. And that is what you guys know.

Alright. So what was with the wight? A, like, two goblet or two? Ghouls? Ghouls.

Ghouls. Okay. Yeah. Ghouls are basically intelligent undead that feed on the flesh of feed on the flesh of other sentient creatures. Let's go get them.

What do you mean let's go get them? I think he means let's go get them. I mean, I slammed my big axe down, and I'd be like, show us the way. Is how do you say his name? Troubadour?

Troubadour. Prince Troubadour. You coming with us to help? Yes. He said accompany me back to destroy them.

Awesome. He's for sure not planning on leaving you. He has a very despite his piecemeal armor, he has a very regal manner about him. And even though he's he looks a little bit goofy and feels a little bit goofy, he definitely he definitely is leaning into the into, like, the chivalrous knight, sort of persona. Okay.

I like it more and more. I think we can trust him. Right? Yeah. Okay.

I'm I'm on board. Okay. So prince Troubadour has joined the party. Excellent. Maybe he'll give us life for us, and then he has to follow us around.

Same as If we find a robot and an Amazonian woman, Chris, I'm calling shenanigans. Chris, like, didn't come out. Well, shoot. Gotta change my whole plan now. So just like writing, good GMs borrow, great GMs steal.

Right. Right. Alright. So, he he leads you, he leads you down the down the board buck, moving moving you stealthily as his armor would allow. Oh, gosh.

You, you guys continue down for about I think it's like about two or three hours. And the boardwalk itself isn't just like a single path. It branches out to different areas and has a number of different, a number of different spots where, it's you can tell that this part of the boardwalk has been more well used than the others and that kind of thing. And as you start rounding a corner, Prince Rubor raises up his hand, says, I believe that they're just around this bend. What?

Tom. He said, I believe that they're just around this bend. Mhmm. I got a bad idea. Why don't I try to hide?

Not ready. I'm gonna take out a scroll. Yeah. Me too. And I think everybody should hide first.

I'm gonna take out my wait. Where's where's my thingy? I'm gonna use that. Are you gonna try to you're gonna try to get their attention and ambush them? Why not?

Oh, I know. I mean, I was gonna try to hide, which I figured would probably alert them to where everybody was. So if you guys all night first, I'll be the only time. I understand. I work in the system here.

The game will not outsmart me. Oh, But that makes sense. Yes. There was something I forgot to mention, and I've just remembered it, at the end of last session. We learned the name of one of those hags.

I forget which one or what her name was, but we learned a name from the goblin back at the, up above the box. The other voice. Yes. You did. Not important right now.

All all that's important is I am naming her as my nemesis for the purposes of my cloak of justice. Yeah. Get him. Or fur or it. Whatever.

Alright. Anyway That's good. Alright. Cool. So, yeah, I'm gonna ready a scroll and, do I want anything else on my other hand?

Carson, you just found the potion of cold retaliation? Yep. I did. Oh, it's go time then. I don't think we got time to wait around.

Me now. Alright. Cool. Sick. Chuck.

Chuck. Chuck. Chuck. That's right. Alright.

Yeah. I'll have a scroll in one hand, and I guess my bow in the other, and we go. We're gonna surprise attack. Okay. So you guys are basically just bum rushing around the around the bend, what I'm hearing?

Sounds like. Alright. Yeah. Yeah. We're gonna take that post.

We're on a timer. I know. We're all set. Oh, for now. Alright.

Okay. So you guys come running around the bend. Oh, yeah. We're gonna surprise the heck out of them. Alright.

We are coming around the mountain. And you see as you get through the bend and the trees start opening up, you see a few more creatures than just the, the, the white and the, and the, ghouls. That's all right. We've got the prince on our side now. Great.

We got this. Unless we don't. Just kidding. I got plenty of other characters I can make. You don't scare me.

Yeah. That's fair. No. No. Basically, the you there's a there's a clearing off the boardwalk that, these creatures are all in.

And in that and in that clearing, you see two ghouls. Well, it's not really clearing. It's there there are trees in, I guess, it's more of a grove. You see the two ghouls. You see the white.

Plus you see four trip key. Oh. So Gildan. This is the white Woah. You see.

Yeah. That cute at all. Wait a minute. Why are they there? These are the ghouls.

Uh-huh. And there are four tripty warriors. And these ones look more like a regular tripty, like, you know, scout leather, leathers, and that kind of thing. Although they do all appear to have grievous wounds. Yeah.

I mean, we learned just a minute ago that the white person yep. Okay. It makes total sense now. Alright. So with that, let's get you guys Oh, how about we just stay right here?

Let's get you guys back over to the battle map. Oh, we found a fight. Protect me, Clark. Why am I protecting you? No.

Right. You just gotta protect us. Oh my gosh. That's it. You're fired.

Oh, you're gonna let the little frog guy be braver than both of you. We're no longer in the water. Oh, right. There's still water around. I mean, you can see if you're looking around, like, they're they're puddles and that kind of thing.

So it's not like full on bog. But you will, in order to be able to not hit the water, you will need to jump from the boardwalk onto the land that the that the bad guys are on. Don't plan on doing that. I wanna get that. Alright.

I'll, stay for me to stay back. First to dive in. What do you mean dive in? Do you realize I'm wearing full plated armor? It's not like I'm gonna move very fast.

He's got me a real though? I mean, I can jump in my mix. You're right. I do. I'm just I'm not jumping from where I'm at.

It's gonna take me teen character wherever. I'm I didn't roll yet. You know who else could jump? Those frogs could jump. Those frogs.

Yeah. I can probably jump. I am sure of it. Do we have some What are we doing? I'm scouting.

Yeah. So we've got also we've all got a plus one. Oh, add that to your role, Clark. Thank you. Some reason I can't I added it, but it's off, but I can't turn it on.

Where do you add it? So that's weird. I don't know. Like, in the initiative box, there's a circumstance thing you can add, but it left it off. I don't know why.

Oh, well. I guess I can just heard good. I was able to add a circumstance bonus. Why do I have them? Cause we've a scout.

Snuck it. Oh, we scouted snuck on it. Alright. As long as I wasn't back, I guess that's probably possible. And you, and you already added the circumstance bonus, Jason?

I did. Okay. We won't share. And here did you? I did not.

I don't know how I do it. That's fine. I can I can edit? It's not a big deal. Oh, all we're has incredible initiative plus two.

Yeah. Took that as my general feat. That is a lot of dices. Uh-huh. That is a lot of enemies' for now.

Alright. So you come barreling around the corner. You see the ghouls. You see the frogs. You see the wights and ACU.

Oh, oh. We get first attack of opportunity? Attack of opportunity? What? I mean, like, the first, like, surprise attack.

Surprise. We're here. Well, I mean They're a ways away. That was the circumstance bonus. So I'm not really sure how to arbitrate that because, typically, it's kinda one of those things where, like, I mean There's there's usually a surprise if you are completely hidden for whatever reason.

Right. Because they don't detect you. Gotcha. But, we are quite detectable. Right.

Okay then. So So the answer to my question is is You got the circumstance bonus. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Okay. Fair enough. Okay. Okay. Okay.

Okay. Okay. Okay. But a couple of them go first, and they're quite far away. So it's actually not bad unless it is.

Well because that looks reasonable. I don't want them far away because I can't hit anyone. Well, that's what I'm saying. Theoretically, they have to close in. But Right.

This goober is looking like he's trying to hurl a mat. Which Right. He still is going to have to close in. But Mhmm. Uh-huh.

So We just don't know how far. He's gonna go. He's hurling that. Where are they? It's too far away.

Too far away. Yeah. Direct. Nerd. He's going to What's up?

He's going to go he's just gonna keep moving. He may be undead, but he's not that stupid. Well, he should be. He should be like, I smell flesh. Flesh.

Ghoul is going to there, there, and he doesn't have any doesn't have any range options. Though he's he's gonna Put on his thumbs? No. He's gonna close. Really trying here.

Alright. Really trying. Chris is not having any of it. Alright. Now it's prince Troubadour's turn.

Yeah. Oh, he got right up in his grill. Yep. Oh my gosh. He's going to target the ghoul.

A better to smash him with. Do it. And That's a good question. Swing his Oh. Hand axe and miss.

Mhmm. Fire and Three bug dole. He's going to let out a terrifying croak. Oh. Excellent.

Yeah. Kroger. And that does yeah. It's an intimidation check, so he's going to intimidate the dude. Perfect.

Make that roll. Well That was good enough. That's it. That's good. And then he's going to, raise his shield.

Seems prudent. Howard, you're up. Alrighty. I am going to say the words. We, sing a little song.

A little dance. Make a little love. Kind of made up on the spot, about a, about a about a prince, who was kind of the opposite of the prince of the frog story, about a prince who was, kissed and turned into a charming frog nobleman. And we are going to, do some courageous antheming here. And I've got it always gets that wrong.

I do sing it, and it sounds kind of weird. I'll just get you and give you a funky look. Bam. Last for three rounds. Sick.

Cool. Then I'm gonna use the scroll that I took out, and I am going to cast we found this in the dungeon. I'm gonna cast worms repast on this here ghoul in front of us, which it looks like it already left my inventory. Well, that's unfortunate. If you hit control space and start typing worms were passed, got a little bit of the spotlight fish spotlight.

Worms were passed. Found it. Perfect. That's neat. Spell item.

Okay. But how do I actually cast it? That's a really good question. He's in four disc piercing damage and one d six persistent piercing damage. Well, I think that we could probably just have him do a fortitude save Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And apply the effects. It's probably the easiest way to do it.

Sounds good. So he'll roll fortitude. Woof. Fail miserably. Oh, that's not good.

Yeah. My LDC is 19, so not quite a crit fail, unfortunately. Okay. So he takes 46 piercing damage. Yep.

And because he's corporeal undead, an extra two d six persistent. So he's taking three d six persistent. Oh, okay. And he is off guard as long as he is taking that persistent damage. See, that's pretty good.

That is really good. Yep. On the 46 upfront. I forgot about the persistent damage portion of that. Maybe you should have tried to target a guy further away, but that is okay.

K. So he's got that. There's only range 30 feet, so I could not have. And then 46 or at 46. Okay.

Damage on him seems pretty good. Wow. Oh, he's already not feeling good. And he's off guard because he failed. Okay.

There we go. I got all the effects. My gosh. That was a lot. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Alright. That's my turn. That's a pretty good turn.

Alright. Yeah. Maybe you should have saved that for the white. Oh, well. For you.

Is that a level? I've only got one. It was a scroll. So yeah. So I don't have a got.

Oh, okay. Oh, okay. We found it. I didn't pay for it. We found that one in the the dungeon.

So Gotcha. Okay. That's good. Like, the next time that we see, I'm a blast them. Right.

Right. You saw him. Good job. Yep. Good job.

So, yeah, there's a very good chance the persistent damage takes that guy out. Yeah. But I also don't know It's possible to ignore him. The white is going to hold its action, what it's gonna do. Preston, you're up.

Come on up. That's too skinny. Well, I guess is is right on the ground water? Yeah. Like on the immediate boardwalk is still over water, but you've got like a five foot jump.

Oh, is that guy in the water? No. He's on the boardwalk. Right? He's on the boardwalk.

Yeah. Am I still on the boardwalk? Is there any way I can stay on the boardwalk on any of these? I would allow it with an with a successful acrobatics check. Alright.

Perfect. I'm gonna go right there then, which I think is 20. I couldn't do it the other way, but I think it's I think it's I think it's right. Okay. Acrobatics.

Just a minute. Let me go there. Skills. Yes, please. Acrobatics.

I'll look at EU. Come here, baby. Is that good enough? With with with an 18, you were able to kind of, like you basically perch yourself on the edge of the, on the edge of the boardwalk. K.

So I'm gonna I'm gonna whack them. Alright. I'm gonna save my stuff for later. The big baddie. I'm gonna tiger strike.

Oh, I can swing. One of those. Nothing? Oh, yeah. Yep.

Yep. One of those. We're just we're just badly mocking you as well. Boom. That is a hit.

Oh. Not bad. Not bad. Above average. And you killed it.

Oh, he was not the one of Resilien. Fire shoots from my hands as I slay the evil undead. Yeah. Okay. That's how I want it to look.

There you go. Sounds fantastic. I know. Right? Yeah.

Sounds like me for a minute. Smear in the background is going, you show off. Oh, he didn't die? I thought he died. No.

He died. Oh, phew. I was like, I just killed him. Shit. What happened?

What's going on? He's back from the dead. He's undead. I guess so. Then.

Result one does. I'm trying to I'm trying to delete the pog so we don't end up with the situation where everybody piles up on top of bad guys. Oh, no. You can get it. I lost it.

Yeah. Gets trapped on it. Alright. So that's Carson's turn here. You're up.

Help me understand the holding of the turn. Like holding the turn means you pull yours, you pull yourself out of initiative order and you don't do anything until you decide to insert yourself back in. So you can't move it at any time, like in the middle of summer, at the end of somebody's turn, you can say, I want to go. Yeah. It's only in between people's turns.

So you can't like in the middle of somebody's turn, insert yourself, but you could, yeah, you could switch switch things around. Am I stupid to think that I'd rather have them come to us? Well Put myself out there or no? You I mean, you can try and lure them in. I saw a jump in.

Yeah. Well, you've you've at least seen one of them turn around and not go in your direction, and you've seen them and you haven't seen the other one act, but, you know, they're basically waiting for you to show up. So There's a lot of bad guys turns, Chris. I understand. Have a habit of wanting to get me to fall down.

That's fair. Now the big now the big guys getting scared. You do have to ask yourself. If he goes undead, like, that's a really big problem. That's true.

Mhmm. I mean, I don't think Yeah. I mean, I I don't think it's a stupid idea, but it could end up being a pretty much a stalemate. And you're you're already pretty far away from them. So Sure.

We only I can insert myself all the way to them. Yeah. You could get all the way to them. And I can pass by Karsten and the frog guy with an athletic check. Yeah.

You can move no. Not even with that with an athletic check. If you're you can move through allied spaces. No problem. Potentially six turns.

Well, hopefully, there'll be fewer bad guys there. Right. I mean, you've got Samir coming back around and then five more turns. Yeah. Yeah.

No. I mean Five more turns. Yeah. Or five more bad guys. I mean, there's an there there definitely isn't, like, there's no harm in in waiting if you if you feel like that's the right the the move that you wanna do.

And plus, you don't have to necessarily, like, insert yourself into the the thick of the people. Right? So I don't know where else you go besides forward. Right. I don't mean to be taking too much time, but, like, I go try to kill this frogger dude on the bottom.

He didn't seem to want to fight. Well, so here's here's some here's some tactical things that might be helpful. If you are within 15 if you're within 15 feet of, Parson, then he has then he has the ability to use his retributive strike Yep. Which may or may not mean that he can do an attack, but he can give you damage resistance. So, like, basically, if you have some sort of ranged situation where you could basically move up and make sure that you're still within 15 feet of, of of Carson in, you know, fling a javelin or something, then you are not going to be in a situation where yeah.

You you you just won't be in a situation where, Carson will that that is right outside of his range. So one step back. There you go. So if you if you run out there, fling a javelin at somebody, then if they come and attack you, then he then he should be able to, at least give you damage resistance when they attack. So So I have to move and draw a spear, which do I have to put my axe down too so I won't even be able to do let me think here.

We've got a two handed weapon. It's an action to reaffirm your grip. You have quickdraw? I don't think that's a thing. Maybe it is.

Quickdraw is actually a thing. Is it? Sick. Yeah. It does exist.

But it doesn't exist for everybody. I think it's specifically like certain martial classes get it. But I don't think I have quick draw. I have quick tempered. Quick flunking.

You are quick tempered indeed. So yeah, you would have to okay, so basically this is kind of what what you'd be looking at here. You could move up, draw a spear, and chuck it, but you won't have your hand on your axe. So if you had like a, a reactive strike, you wouldn't be able to swing your axe to hit anybody. But next round, you can grab your ax and continue to attack.

So so you can totally fling a spear, move, chuck a spear, and and be able to and be able to get that done. You just won't have you you you'll basically effectively just be holding your ass with one hand, so you can't swing it until you grab it, until you reaffirm your grip. Okay. So I can do some stuff maybe. I still did.

How far is the range on a spear? Because I've never used them before. Say? It looks like, it's a 20 foot. And with those big bulging muscles?

Well, that's stupid, Chris, because everyone's 25 feet away from me. Thank you. Can you throw it further? It's just a penalty. I forgot how it works here.

Yeah. I'm no good unless I'm right next to anybody. I don't mind moving up there and just getting killed and see what Carstar does. Oh, you're silly. I'm being silly.

No. I think, so we'll just we'll just go ahead and we'll just go ahead and say that if you wanna throw it, you can you can hit somebody. You'll just, the the math might already be in there. Like, the penalty might already be in there. So go ahead and pick somebody in throw.

Oh, and then do awesome like that. Oh, right. You hit. How'd I hit? Oh.

Yep. And yeah. So and we'll damage. Amazing. They were.

Hey. You you you hit like normal people now. Oh my goodness. You hit eight points at damage? Eight damage.

Nice. Alright. It's okay. That's a lot like the word. No, that's how it is.

There you go. That's pure. I was going to say that's pretty normal. That might be the worst you've ever done. Yeah.

That might be normal. Not an axe can't even go that long. Not a jerk. Right? It's minimum damage is nine.

Right? That's it. That's all I do. I guess I think it's 10 even. 11.

Oh my gosh. You're fired. I'm just talking talking big demon butt. Taking the damage. The griply scout is going to attack I have to do some nagling here.

So he's going to attack with a net. So he flings a net at you. Does a 28 hit. Oh. And if so by how much?

Yeah. So does a crit. Yes. 28 does indeed crit. You have an 18 AC?

Yes. He does. Okay. So you are off guard. You take a negative 10 circumstance penalty to your speed.

On a critical, you're restrained. Yeah. Do I get a fortitude? Nope. You are see here.

No. I should've kept my turn. You are not off guard. Your own well, you're you're restrained, not not off guard. So you are off guard by that.

But, like, so, what restrained means is you're tied up and can barely move. You have you're off guard and immobilized, so you can't move. You can't use any attack or manipulate actions except for the escape action. And when when your turn comes up, you can spend an action to try and escape. But you're basically got you basically got covered in a net, and it's basically weighing you down.

I'm feeling Tamir, you're up. Yep. Great. I will, I will attack. Attack.

I think it's this one. Right? Yeah. Not that one. Oh, okay.

There we go. We're gonna attack this one, and we'll attack this one. Okay. It is not letting me do this. Why are you not letting me do it?

Alright. There we go. I have successfully targeted both, the perfectly fine horrid lady and the, seen better days horridly ugly elvish looking dude. Can you see the white? Yes.

I don't really know. I can look at the map here and you I'm not seeing you see her. Yeah. You got Grippleys and you got the you got the, Grippleys. The frogmen.

Okay. And the ghoul. Yeah. I see a bunch of shadows and stuff, but they're they're not there. So I wasn't thinking it'd be an issue.

I can move here, pretty reasonably. Staying on our boardwalk. So that'll be inaction. There you go. And I guess I will have to change one thing.

We'll do it that way. Oh, I'm supposed to roll for my, sporadic craziness. Right. What is is that the d 20 and then a d four? I think that you just need to roll, to figure out which random, spell rank you get.

So I guess since you've got four. Yeah. Three. I don't was it? Okay.

So, generally, how we have been doing it is just cut it in half. So so if it's a one or a two, it's a rank one. One. If it's a three or four, it's rank two. Alright.

So that that okay. Don't know why I did that. Shut my spell person down. Alright. Good.

Alright. So am I still I still have that. I do have that check targeted. Okay. I am doing the blazing a boat spell.

K. I will use the weak things. I'll only be attacking the nasty check. This could be the round. Yeah.

I lost you. K. I'm rolling my attack now. Attack. Attack.

Attacking. Oh, that was a good attack. Seems pretty good. Yeah. That's as good as I get darn near.

Yeah. Yeah. And I did hit. Alright. Yes.

Holding damage. Nice job, buddy. Holy cow. Nice. No.

I didn't do too bad. Any anything I need to do to damage here? No. Just just roll it in there, take care of it on my end. Alright.

Better than oh. Where did you go? 16. Yeah. He disappeared.

I don't know where he is. Oh, okay. Oh, yeah. I fell off the map, You got visibility right here. I know.

I know you're supposed to be right there, but you are not right there. No. I'm I'm clearly not right there. Cool. Back up.

Hold on a minute. Here we go. And Zooming out, I don't see myself hiding anywhere. Did you just delete your pollock accidentally? It's possible.

I wouldn't know how to do that, but I'm not in the initiative either. Oh, okay. Oh, let me I could just drag your your character back on here and There you go. There you go. And we will put you back in combat.

And your combat initiative was The seventeenth. Alright. We'll change that over to 17, and we'll pretend like this never happened. Oh. Mhmm.

Alright. You got him. Oh, you're placing bolt, erupts the ghoul in flame, and it turns to cinder. Point of I mean, this is not in my favor, but I could only attack the one chick. So I did try to undo that the one ghoul.

I was just attacking the I didn't I didn't have two attacks on that one. I used too many other things too many other actions. So Okay. I will one I hit. So Yep.

Well, you you decimated the guy. So Yeah. It's still good. Alright. Alright.

So we've got a, trip a trip key is gonna move up, and he's gonna pull out a low dart targets to here, and spit something at you. Uh-oh. Which Like Uber. Yeah. Which is a critical hit.

They're all up. Just critical hitting. Well, it helps when your opponent is immobilized. So Yeah. True.

Or it does. So, and he does six points of damage with this critical hit. Blow dart. Right in your leg. Vicious vicious blow dart.

You're wrestling with the wrestling with the net and then you get a blow dart in the butt. I'm in a good place. Right in the kisser. Right right in the so what do I get for jumping out front, Carson? I told you that, but you were like, I don't care.

I'm gonna go die. That'd be perfect. Right. Maybe. This guy is gonna run up and try and try and strike you with his sickle while you're down.

I think while he's down. We he sure did. It doesn't even matter what they roll. They just keep hitting. Yeah.

They're not doing a whole lot, though. Yeah. But it adds up. It is. Over time.

And then he's going to gonna untarget Kihir. We're gonna target Karsten, and we're gonna flinging net at him. Nope. Going to evade. Dodge.

That's right. You will. You will indeed. Oh, broke the screen. Critical failure.

So he runs up and stat and hacks at hacks at Cahir, and then he takes it then he takes a net that he has in his other arm, flings it at Karsten, and Karsten just jumps out of the way. Right. The net was a little bit wide. Boom sh Missed terribly. And he's gonna shoot another dart at him.

Missed terribly again. Oh, that's sad. Can our frog untie me? I don't see why not. Come over.

Let's see how we're gonna do this. He's got a knife, doesn't he? He has a little hatchet thing. But I think that I think that we're going to have him do a like, you would have to get you'd have to get a you have to get a certain target number to escape. So with him assisting, he's gonna he's basically just gonna try and try and, hit that target number with with his, with his stuff here.

So, he's gonna use his survival to try and get the net off, which he does. Yeah. And he's going to raise his shield. I have a question about waiting for it to take your turn. Does this crazy bad guy have to insert himself before hour?

Nope. Nope. She basically just kinda loses a turn if she if she doesn't do it in the mid in the middle of it. But Yep. You know, she's kind of okay with it.

I will yell up. Sire, are those your people? Prince Troubadour will will respond and say they were before the white got to them. Do I know from the role I made earlier about, like, the the white's affliction? Is this a reversible thing or no?

It's to your knowledge and with your skills, there is nothing reversible about it as far as you know. Okay. It's basically like they die and then the curse takes effect. They're not gonna die. Okay.

Understood. So they are already dead effectively? Correct. Yep. If you're awake and find yourself in green fields.

Okay. Cool. Well, in that case Green fields. Oh, shoot. What'd I do?

You broke it. You broke it. Whatever I did, I didn't mean to. I think I moved myself to initiative. I think you're no.

I think you're in Did I not? Okay. Alright. Cool. I probably did something.

No. You did. Yep. It had the it had the the white as their initiative token. There you go.

Yeah. Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool.

Alright. Well, I still think I'm gonna do this because it's about the best chance I'll know because they're already dead, you said. They are. So these things are themselves undead They are. As far as I know.

Right. Crap fart. I have the smell I've been wanting to use, but it doesn't work on mindless things. Alright. Well, cool.

I guess well, I can't get up there. What options do I have here? Alright. Well, I guess step one is I'm going to move. Alright.

We'll move right up here. I'm a little closer. And then step two, that's a cone. I don't wanna do that. Can I see the, the big undead thing from here or is she, like, hiding in the trees?

She's you you can see her. She's she's under the tree, but she's not, like, nice. Okay. Well, that's too far away. Anyway, so I can't do that either.

Can I do that? Nope. That's only 30 foot too. Alrighty then. If I need to screw everybody up, all I gotta do is put you 60 feet away from the bad guys.

Well, I've got spells that go that far. They just wanna work on undead as previously mentioned. Alright. That's fine. We're gonna target, these two little frogger guys, and we're just gonna use old faithful, and I'll let them.

Alright. There you go. Not bad. Oh, not bad. Alright.

We like failures. Ouch. Both take full. Okay. Alright.

And that is my turn. Alright. K. So she is actually going to go up here, up over here. Yeah.

Right about there. Oh, wow. She does the same thing. Hello, friend. She's gonna run up to, Carson, and she's gonna attack.

Oh. She's gonna crit. Oh my gosh. Yep. Sure is.

Okay. So do the damage part first. Is that on me? Uh-huh. Do you wish to shield block?

Yeah. Of course. On this one. Holy nikes. Actually so big.

It's just a graphic. Yeah. So is she in the water right now, Chris? Yeah. She is.

Okay. Alright. Alright. Alright. Cool.

That's terrifying. Okay. So Karsten, you have okay. You're shield blocking. So do that.

But she only do 14 points of damage though? No. You could probably do 400. Well, there's, there are after effects and that kind of thing. So this is just the initial damage is the 14 points.

Yeah. It's, not the damage that's gonna suck. Yeah. No lights out of these. No.

Right. Alright. So you shield block, but also, the, prince Troubadour, like, has a flash of of light that erupts from him as you get attacked. Oh. And he activates his flash of grandeur, which for you, you gain it's a it's a similar effect to, your retributive strike.

So you gain damage reduction, for the rest of the round equal to his level plus two. And you also, you also have a revealing light, which a wave of magical light washes over the area you choose. The appearance of light is such colorful heatless flames sparkling modes a creature affected by the revealing light is dazzled. So everybody within a 10 foot burst is dazzled by the, by the light, which in this case is just the white. But Suck.

And then we'll do damage for Karsten. How much does he actually take? K. Alright. So I think you ended up only taking I can't see anything.

So You take, so shield absorbs four damage, and then the flash of grandeur absorbs five. So you take five damage. I only need you to make a fortitude saving throw, please. Which one is a fort? If you look at the if you look at the chat, there's a click on the chat.

Oh. If I didn't save it, then I'm gonna reroll that. Just so you know. Seems like a reasonable one. Yeah.

Seems like a reasonable one to use it on. Thank you. And since it's 09:00, I'm assuming that I have two of them. So I will use it twice if I need to. You can't use a hero point more than once for one rule.

But you should only need one. Oh, do I need to use it? You will need to use it. I would. 16 ain't great.

That's better. That is better. Well, you do save. Okay. And since you did save, you feel a curse trying to take hold of you, but you are able to push it away.

I scream in its face. And, Karsten, you are up. I'm gonna, holy crap, strike him, and then I'm going to touch him, or her, or it. It's the it's the blue thing, right, that I'm hitting? The blue weird circle on the screen?

Yes. Yeah. Okay. Just making sure. You might wanna touch him first.

If you hit him on a tight swing, I'll push him back. Oh, that's fine. Alright. I'm I will be touching this guy. Where's my there it is.

Lay on hands on undead. They have a DC save. Oh, wait. So Gerald Tarrant was a challenging and dangerous proposition. Chris, do I just do the DC save?

I don't know what to do. No. I haven't save. Oh, I've never touched on dead before. Critical success.

Yeah. That's lame. Okay. Cool. That's it.

Right? Wow. Nothing happens? She's got some Oh. Universe.

Yeah. That's stupid. Okay. I'll spend the rest of them, and, I'm gonna whack her. When they're done.

Yeah. Oh. Nope. Nope. Nope.

Do it again. I am. Alright. That's a hit. Yay.

Full damage. Oh my gosh. Right? Sucks. And she is pushed back five feet.

That was a waste. Alright. Next up. Do I have to so you said my great axe, I don't have in both my hands at the moment? Right.

You've you've got you you have you have to spend an action to re equip your axe effectively. So would that mean, like, on my character sheet, it says sheathe the spear? Is that the actual thing? Yeah. The axe.

Just mark it as sheath. But yeah. Yeah. Because the great axe already says two hands. So Yeah.

And then another undead comes running out of the grove at the grip at the trip trip keys. Oh. We're we're moving out we're moving into. This one is going to target, our. You have not seen this before.

Okay. Questions. Yeah. Go ahead. What it is.

Okay. Let me take a look at this ability. Inventory actions. Oh, look at that thing. Happened to its toes.

Uh-huh. It was undead. Excellent. Before it attacks me Yes. I am going to use empathetic plea, which send a chat.

Here we go. That a creature attacks me that I have not acted hostile towards yet. I have not acted hostile towards this guy because I didn't even know he was there. Correct. Yeah.

So I'm using my reaction to do that. I attempt a diplomacy versus his will. So we'll do that now. So let's say 24. Nice.

Okay. He did succeed. On a success, he takes a negative two circumstance penalty to damage. Okay. Alright.

We will just drop the empathetic plea, effect on him. So and how long does that last? By two two, until the beginning of its next turn. Okay. And it might be more than a negative two.

Hang on one second. Where am I? Well, if it is, like, I basically just pulled the empathetic plea effect from the spell onto or from the building onto the character. So it's a negative two penalty damage on triggering a strike, the strikes against the target. Yeah.

Yeah. It should be negative four. Yeah. So, yeah, that should be worked into the math, but I can check. Yeah.

We'll find out. I mean, he's just gonna miss anyway, so, you know, it doesn't matter. That's right. Yeah. Let's let's still do what's gonna happen.

Well, he did not miss. I Not my lot. Wow. I cannot use your flicker because I use my reaction, but that's fine. Wow.

No. He did not create me, thankfully. No. Alright. So we will do that.

And, Carson, you have the ability to use your reaction to attribute of strike this guy. You wouldn't be able to actually attack him, but you could add, damage resistance to Alwar if you so desired. Oh, yeah. I will definitely do that. So, will I need to double check him?

Yeah. So basically, all that you need to do is find your retributive strike, and there's a spell effect on it that is effect champions resistance. And just pull that onto him before I before I apply damage. Oh, spell. No.

Where is it? It's an ability. It's not spell. You gotta go to your actions. There should be a recipe to strike in there.

If you click on it, it'll have a it'll have a little effect that you can pull on to our I have a hard time pulling anything anywhere. There we go. Nope. Didn't quite make it. I don't know.

I think it's I can't do it. I'm using a mouse. Yes. Gosh. Okay.

So I was like it sounds like you're struggling with the trackpad, but No. No. I I'll just get it. I'll just put it on him. No.

I I did it. I got it. Oh, yep. I got it now. Oh my gosh.

I didn't struggle with that. I don't know why. Alright. Okay. So we'll apply the damage.

You take 10 damage because you have five five damage resistance. So And I need you to make a fortitude save. Sure thing. That sure looks like a hero point to me. Yeah.

The way these guys have been going, holy cow. I don't know if you can, like I I think you just have to do a Probably, we will use a hero point. Found it. Oh, you got it? Perfect.

Alright. That did succeed. Perfect. So you are currently in the clear. Likewise, you you feel some sort of you you might not be able to identify it as a curse, but some sort of, like, juju, like, weird stuff.

Yep. But you're able to, you're able to push it out with your with your sheer, determination, but, you know, just your Yep. Physical fortitude. Mhmm. Mhmm.

Excellent. Glad glad you've got fortitude. Alright. Yeah. I know where it came from, but because you're heroic.

Alright. Right? Is the white in the water still? Oh, yeah. Well, the the white got pushed out of the water.

So, the the one that attacked Karsten, is actually on dry land. Oh, and the other one that attacked Alwars on dry land too? That one is actually wading in the water. I wanna hit the frog. Any frog I hit, I probably have to know it's the one right in front of me.

What are you doing? Hit the big flipping I don't wanna get beaten. Those frogs have been whittling away on the poor barbarian all night long. Oh, man. The sucky part is I can only hit one of them, so I only have two actions.

Right? Right. Let's go after the big dude then. Can I do a long jump with ease over there? Yeah.

You can jump over there. Jump in. You guys are by a correct. 60. Otherwise, I'm dead.

So can I jump over there? Yes. So I'll need an athletics check, but, yeah, you can jump over there. Cool. Good enough.

Even rolling a four. It's good enough. All right. You, you leap over the, you leap over the water, you get right next to her. 20 critical hit.

Oh man. Not in critical. We need big money here. Big money. Gosh.

That's not as big as I guess. Oh my gosh. Yep. Oh, jeez. Good enough.

Oh my gosh. Good. You should've killed her, jerk. Where were you? Gosh.

Giving you a chance. Yeah. I know. Nothing. Ears.

Hey. Hi. So she, she has an ability called final spite, which means she gets to make an attack before she dies. Oh, what pain? Oh, she's gonna go ahead and do that.

Yep. You're gonna final strike you right in the other guy where you got a blow dart right in your tongue, your bum. I think it might be more on my energy. Mhmm. Like in the front groin.

Alright. So we're gonna go ahead and target target the one we're gonna do. Oh my gosh. Right. She's got a monster in here.

That's a crit. So we're gonna No. I'm not. Damage. Seven?

He's too far out. Or no. It's not that he's too far out. You've already used your reaction. Save our.

So, so here's taken, he already used his reaction as well. Say to save you, which is, which is you've already took. Yeah. He he's already used it. No.

You're good. And I'm gonna need a I need a four two save where you could hear. Not that I'm terribly concerned that you won't make it. And you do. Okay.

And then she dies. Sorry. Sorry, Chris. Oh, no need to be sorry. I I I am not I am not upset by this at all.

So She seemed like she would be tougher than that though. Not when you do 44 points of damage. No. She was she was tougher than that. If she was completely fresh and you did 44 points of damage, she would still have been alive.

Yeah. Like, it wasn't you just one shotting her. It's the fact that she'd taken so much damage already. And then You one shot her with your stick. Yeah.

And let's see. This guy, he's going to triple move away. Oh. Well, now he's got these little peons. Like, I don't wanna kill him.

Can we just tie him up? They are undead creatures that want to kill you dead. I know. I mean, you can tie them up, but you're gonna have to deal with them sooner or later or somebody is. If you just leave them out here, then, you know, you're basically dooming somebody else to death.

Mhmm. Yep. Not necessarily. I mean But do undead creatures do? They're undead.

It's not undead creatures. We're gonna turn these wild boars off to our side over here into undead wild boars and and that's really bad. Yeah. Oh, Samir, you're up. Oh, it's my dream.

Sorry. Well, you. We will we will target that individual. We will do a this. I need to I think I need to where are you?

Can't see think I can get both of these guys. So I'm gonna target him and target him. She Yep. Yeah. You got it.

I think I'm gonna be in trouble, though. I can't because they're supposed to be within 10 feet of each other. Oh, yeah. I got it. 20, so I can't do that one.

Right. So I'll do that one. I can only do the one. I will attack. Oh, I do not roll that?

Probably ought to. Where is an option to reroll you? You right click on it. There's a reroll with your Oh, okay. You hit.

I rolled almost as well as I did last time. Alright. Dimash. Oh, yeah. Lots of ones there.

Good job, buddy. Good. Alright. Jeez. Alright.

That could have been really great, though. Well, I mean, it's a snare. There's there's really nothing great here. So that was one action. Yeah.

That's not what I want. I think I want to I'm gonna continue. I can I'm just gonna I'm gonna do another spell on that bird. Okay. Gust of wind.

Yeah. So he needs to make a fortitude save. There you go. Which they seem to be doing very well. He does.

He crit succeeds. Alright. It happens then, I'm sure. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. He is unaffected by your gust of wind. It's unfortunate. Alright. That's all I got.

K. And that was two actions plus the other one was an action. So Two runners, and one runs up to prince Troubadour. He says and he says, Greenleaf, don't. Don't do it.

Greenleaf is not listening. Oh, Greenleaf. Wow. He smacked him. Max damage.

Then Greenleaf is gonna swing again. This time he's going to back this guy. Run up here and hack Samir. Miss. Attack Samir again.

This time he hits. I will hear you. K. Because I'll have to pull that onto your guy. Where did that go?

Alright. I tried, but I'm not sure. What's going on? Alright. The will mark is concealed.

That means that I need to do flat check. Wow. When she fails. So you Wow. So he attacks you, and his sickle just passes straight through you.

Now I'm going to need you to, gotta throw up a a flat check on the, on the chat. I'm gonna need you to click on the d 20 next to that. See if you pass. You fail, so that means that you have to deal with some What have my average rolls been here? I I rolled a a two.

You have Yep. A three, a two, another two. I rolled a one that I rerolled to get to three. Yeah. I should just start rolling d four.

Right. Alright. So you have the encroaching presence. With mild backlash, this, is there there something on your mind lingering or you become frightened three. In three, Wow.

Yeah. And then the backlash condition. Hamzie, do you know what the, condition is for the frightened fleet frightened three to disappear? What do you mean? The condition for it to disappear?

Samir is suffering from mild backlash from eerie flicker. Okay. Typically what happens, like, with the troll stuff, it's like until you eat something, you have to deal with this. Oh, okay. And this is one of those conditions that just Three three.

Yeah. It goes goes down by one per round? Yeah. It looks like it goes down per per round. Yep.

Yeah. We'll just automatically fall off eventually. Yep. Okay. Cool.

Sorry. I'm Still learning this game. Okay. So the, so the the Trupti warrior isn't able to attack you because, the, thing passes through you. Now, prince prince Troubadour is going to be attempting to lay his friend to rest.

Oh. He hits him for four damage. Swing again. Actually, wait, wait, wait, wait. What's he gonna do here?

He's not going to swing again. He's not gonna swing again. He's going to do he's gonna do his duty. He's gonna do his job. And he is going to turn around and lay on hands on Out War.

Oh. And you have the spell effect lay on hands which gives you a plus two, which gives you a plus two AC now. So Excellent. Not only are you healed, but you have plus two AC. Secure.

And then he's going to raise his shield. Now you're up, Alwar. Alright. Alwar. He's gonna be about the only sensible thing he can do in this position, I think.

I will catch a spell. Oh, yeah. I was hoping you'd say that. I, after getting attacked by this thing, Elwar kind of, like, streaks back a little, like, and, kinda reflexively, mutters a few words under his breath, and this, like, purplish, ray shoots out from him and hits the undead in front of him. And I am casting in feeble on him, and he needs to make a fortitude saving throw.

Oh, gosh. Anything but fortitude. Excellent. Oh, wow. He is in two for a minute.

Oh, that's a long time. It is. Yep. So all his strength based stuff is lowered, which I hope is this to hit. Alright.

And then I will do the next most sensible thing to do in this position. Run away. Run away. Run away. And make room for somebody else to come in and hit the sky.

That's appropriate. And so you have some medicines. Burstyn, you're up. Yeah. Go.

Hey. I'm going to move. Maybe. Man, I'm not moving very far. I'm gonna move to that ledge.

Do you want me to make a balance check? Well, why don't you just get onto the, onto the from that place, you would need a balance check. But if you were just diagonal from him, you'd be able to you you will need to. Right there? Yep.

Oh, okay. So I did move. Okay. And so I moved and I'm going to strike him hard. Winner of the dawn.

Oh. Solid average damage. Yeah. That's my turn. Titan swinging.

Go ahead and roll a, go ahead and roll a, I haven't been having you roll your flat check. Roll your flat check. Every time you use Titan Swing, you need to roll a roll a resistance check. I don't know where to even find that. Just roll d 20 and make sure it's not make sure it's not five or more or make sure it's five or more or make sure it's wait.

Are you in here? I think it's five or more you said before. No. Well, it's five or more if you aren't already dealing with a backlash. You have a mild backlash already.

So it's 10 or more, but you still pass it. Yep. Oh, good job. Thank you. Alright.

E. Gonna jump back in here. Target Carsten. He's not he's not actually gonna move up. He's going to start singing Oh.

A very haunting funeral dirge. I need everybody, I need everybody to make well, wrong button. Oh. I need everybody to make a will saving throw. Just give me one second here.

The will. All the targets. Yeah. It's not bad. We'll take a success.

Boom. You're not breaking my will, punk. I did better than my usual four. You did. You did.

You got seven. I think that's the highest tonight. That I've seen anyway. Okay. So who rolled above the 21?

I did. I did. Okay. So you two are Nothing. Don't buy you as a hero point?

Nope. Me. Yeah. It looks like someone did. Yep.

I do. Alright. Talk to you later. Samir and Prince Troubadour. Sameer and Prince Troubadour are the ones that are affected at this point.

I'm gonna take it. K. Take it away. So anybody who succeeded is frightened one. Mhmm.

So enemy, that's you. That's you. Everybody who failed is frightened too. That's you and that's you. I'm frightened five.

Well, yes. Superbible. All of the frightened. Yeah. And the funeral dirge effect.

Wait. Wait. Wait. That is incorrect. Nobody here has the funeral dirge.

I haven't I don't know. I haven't looked or had any in I think Wednesday maybe was the last time I had any. Funeral dirge? Okay. So he he starts chanting funeral dirge and then, kinda moves up this direction.

And he's kinda hard to kill. Here. You're up. Mister Anderson, are you there? Sorry.

I was muted. Muted. Unmuted. I'm seeing how far away these other two that ran away are. They're quite a ways away.

Yeah. They triple moved away. How hard is it for me to jump back onto the thing and then over the water to the person who just went? It's d c 15 to get to get back on there. What if I wanna get back on there and then jump over and try to get over there?

How many moves is that? Oh, let's see how far away you are. 45 feet. And he's currently standing in water too, if you don't care about that. I do care.

How do how do I get into, like, this position? Just, just an athletics check. Easy peasy. I think you'll probably pass unless you roll a one. I'll say that, Chris.

Passed. K. So you jump back on the the barge avoiding the water. Or not the barge, the the boardwalk. Boy.

You do hit. Oh, yay. Even on a one? It's a critical hit. I'm sorry.

I'm just ridiculous. Crits double damage there. You get it? If you've got a plus 11 and you crit, that's a plus 22. So I know.

I see that. Just saying. Alright. So you jump up there. You kill a guy.

Now what? I have one more action. I'm gonna go up, hang out by these people. See if I'm getting some action. Right.

See if anybody leans on me. Alright. Where are they running to? They're They're running away. They are now officially off the map.

Samir, you're up. Where are they? A little frogs or something? Two of the frogs. Panzies.

I'm the one frightened. That is uncouth. Uncooth. Alright. We're going to find a loose stick laying around in the locations here, and we're going to tell genetic projectile said stick at that chick.

Okay. Oh, I almost rolled more than a three. All around that three were high numbers. I know. Right?

I was I was like for the net for just a second. And I was like, oh, I'm always out of 19. Oh, three. How many hero points you got? Yeah.

I see. Two. Roll them. Let me Oh, yeah. Got two.

That is nice. Reroll. I don't mind if I delete. It's not when I right click it, it's not okay. There it is.

Sorry. Good. Good. Alright. What?

Yeah. Still missed. An 18 misses? Yes. Didn't just kill didn't just kill all of hit all of these tricky guys' buddies for no reason.

Do you have any do you have any more actions? That was banned action. Right? No. I guess that was two.

Alright. Well, I'm gonna hop down into the water here and Right. Wander around in the water for a few seconds. Alright. You immediately take five points of fire damage.

Okay. While you are in the water, you have five you have five, you have five points of fire of persistent fire damage. Oh. Ew. You got a hosed.

And they're all standing in the water still. Right? Right. K. You should probably get out of there.

Yeah. I probably should. We'll see if this guy does anything. Okay. That is the end of my turn.

I've used all my actions. Oh, you're still in the fire? Yep. It's a frog's turn, it looks like then. Alright.

Sorry. I had to stop your persistent fire damage. Alright. The frog is going to, the the frog is on the edge of the water, but not actually in in the water at this point. But given the tasty target, he's definitely going to be attacking you.

You are no longer eerie flickering. Yikes. Be hit by zero. Yeah. Mhmm.

Carson, you have the ability to retributive strike to the air. I do. Yep. I'm far away now. If you get attack, you're 15 feet he's 15 feet out.

It's a 15 you've got a 15 foot, aura. Oh, okay. I really thought it was they had to be real closer. There you go. I gave it to you, buddy.

Okay. Alright. Thanks. So I don't know what that means. Alright.

If you click yes, it doesn't actually do anything. It's just a reminder. Okay. Oh, wait. I have to I still have to drag it to him?

Yeah. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. Oh, no worries. I wanted to do the other thing where I can just do it in the chat.

Oh, I did it. Yeah. I got it. Good job. Uh-huh.

I figured it out. So you take no damage after it attacks you. Oh. Thanks. And it's going to continue to attack you.

Mhmm. Oh, that's a much better hit. You're still taking no damage because the, because the champion's reaction basically gives you damage reduction for the entire round. And the last one misses. Mhmm.

So You took zero damage. Yeah. You just saved you just saved Samir eight damage from from that reaction, which is Yeah. Pretty simple. For good.

That's a lot. Yeah. That's me. Alright. Our Europe.

Alrighty. This guy has seen better days. There's not a whole ton. Yep. I think it's just gonna be thanks again.

Looks like my things dropped. So, we will start off by saying the words. I'm getting my butt back up. Right. Then, yeah, we're just gonna light our carpet, Skye.

It's 10:00, dude. You're in bed. Alright. Go to the bathroom before you go to bed. Alright.

That's me. Me in bed is First thing, you're up. Alright. So Nice. Nice.

Nice. I am going to Taruken him because I got something. You got the you're gonna come yummy on him? Yes. But I don't know where that is.

What you're looking for Divine grace, signs of the sun. Elemental elemental blast is what you're looking for. Oh, not there. In your actions. Oh, I am in actions.

I don't I see l channel elements. Is that it? Sign of the sun? Is that it? No.

No. No. Look look up Oh, I see. I'm sorry. In your attacks.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

Goodness. I'm not tight swinging. I'm just going to try to kill you. Here we go. Do I have one more thing to roll?

Right? Probably. Perfect. Looks like you've got one hero point left. Yep.

Yes. Oh, man. Alright. That hits. Come on, baby.

Yeah. I'll do it again. Alright. What did you do? Nothing.

He's using his kinases. He's using his kinases power. Okay. Nothing. And there we go.

Oh, all done. Okay. Yeah. He's gonna he's gonna stay where he's at. It is the other undead creature's turn, and he's just gonna three strike three strikes Samir.

I'm not trying to kill you. Oh, no, buddy. I am. Oh, you're actively trying to kill yourself. What the heck is the point?

Alright. That's, 10 points of damage to use mirror. I'm gonna need a fortitude save. Well, we'll we'll cover the fortitude saves after I reattacked you. No.

I'm good here. Yeah. And my fort, AC is probably down quite a bit, isn't it? Yeah. It is.

Yeah. Because you're frightened. Yeah. Yeah. Down a ton.

Put it in third, probably. He did miss with his third attack. So I'm going to need two fortitude saves. Cool. K.

So one oh my gosh. Okay. When? Let's see. Looks like I still have one zero point.

So maybe that eighteen or sixteen or whatever, that was really bad. I could reroll that one. Still have my, retribution strikes up. Well, you've got an you've got an eight. The the eight is the one that you want to reroll them up to 16.

Just give me a call right now, but it's not like me. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. That's always giving me his pop up message.

It's not let me. I think there's there there's a little couple of arrows right next to it. It says there's a little rebal, like, two arrows in a circle. Yeah. Click on that.

Yep. Alrighty. And it does. Oh, even better. Well, you actually that is actually better because you went from critical failure to just a failure.

Mhmm. So alright. So he gets temporary hit points. You become drains two. That is that is that.

Alright. Cahir, you're up. Also, it is 10:01. So Oh, yeah. I know that people are I I wanna be respectful of people's time.

So I can do, like, ten more minutes. I'll say I'm gonna finish this. We're pretty pretty much wrapping up. Yeah. Alright.

Well, Keir, you're up. What are you gonna do? I'm not jumping in the water. I said that. Come on in.

The water's great. Great. Oops. Well, I mean, you do know that you've got it's only five it's five points damage that you're taking. It you it's it's not, you know, one meter or some on.

I mean, the wizard did it. Oh, that's true. Yep. Alright. Yeah.

Alright. Yeah. Should I tighten swing? Might as well. Yeah.

Yeah. I think that's gonna do it. Oh, buddy. Wow. Yep.

Imagine it sure will. Let's see. Let's see. Yep. It did.

And Mir. Mir, you're up. Oh, it's my turn. Splendid. You splattered that guy.

Okay. Great. I'm going to I'm going to attach the frog thing. That's my highest goal of the night. I need to do that again.

Right? And that's the minus five. Right? Right. You're just trying to smack it with, My staff.

Yeah. Yeah. Alright. How does that not hit? Alright.

He has a lot of negatives on him right now. He's frank five. So, anyway, yeah, they're I swung three times. At this point, I'm like, my strategy is to seeing the other guys run away. It was just just the fact that these guys keep them engaged long enough.

I obviously can't do a bloody thing. They might as well somebody might as well try and kill them. Yeah. Oddly enough, because you because you were, because you have the champions reaction or you have the, champions damage resistance, you take no damage from your persistent damage. Nice.

Good. That's fine. This guy's gonna try and bolt as well. Frogger, get him. Troubadour.

There you go. That's his name. Yeah. Lord, they must have, like, a crazy movement. No.

The e is just moving three. Good. He's got regular movement, but he goes 75 if he uses all three actions to do it. She's gone. Right.

Go ahead and end that encounter, I am I would like to apologize. I wasn't thinking this was gonna be as big of a slog as it ended up being. But just goes to show that, environments matter, I guess. Make you better. Yeah.

Yeah. Right. Right. Yay. We did it.

Woo. Good job, peoples. Good job. Let me get the, the loot that you get. Yeah.

The loot. On there, and then we can hold a day. 50 XP. I know. Right?

I mean, it's so close. I mean, I'm over a thousand yet? Oh, not yet. No. I'm so close.

So close. But yet so far. I know. Okay, ladies. Alright.

And that's what you find off the bodies. Oh, excellent. Oh, it's porn. Oh, yikes. Lion band?

Interesting. What's going on? That demon horn is consumable? No. It's a permanent item.

Oh, okay. That's kinda cool. Interesting. Alright, Derbys. Alright.

Have a good night. I'll be up. Too. Thanks, Chris. Have a good night, everybody.

Yep. Yep. Have a good one. Thanks.
