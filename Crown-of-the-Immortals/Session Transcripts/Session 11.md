There it goes. I was gonna say incoming scary sound. Or not that it's scary. It just always gets me. Yeah.

It's it is yeah. Not scary. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

It looks like you're right. Ramsey is talking to us. What's that? Oh, well done. Well, that's kinda Right?

Oh. Right? I have a polymorph IRL. Yep. That's right.

Just like that one. With yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I am not a cat.

Yeah. That is so funny. Oh, man. And And the I like the whole eyes and everything, like, the guy was like, I don't know what to do. I don't know how real it is, but it was super funny.

It was hilarious. Oh, no. I'm pretty sure that actually happened. What? For real for real?

I'm really here, though. I'm not a cat. Things you would never thought you would hear in a courtroom. Right? I mean, for someone that's a professional.

Like Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, Anderson, are you stoned?

What are you doing over there? You're not you're not even moving. Just vibing. I think waiting on this conversation to be done with. That's just a picture, isn't it?

You're not even there. You can't see me? No. He's moved. He's moved.

No. He's not moved on my screen. Yes. Randall moving? Well, yeah.

I saw that. I'm moving. Anderson's, like, still, like a like a pitcher. I came to confirm Well, that's your own fault. Yeah.

That's your own fault, Clark. He's he's definitely moving on on Randy. Yeah. Alright. So, while we wait for Jason, it's actually a bad guy's turn.

So Yeah. A bad guy. Bad guys just went, and they just made us turn into black. Only some of them did. There's more.

Yeah. I wanna see one of them. Always. Don't worry. There's always more.

So It's not and after this flaming retribution destroyed all of the wickedness, the Underdark would still be here. It's the crazy lady's turn. Oh. Arm? She can't even see me.

Oh, can't she, though? No. No. You cannot. I have called it.

Great. So that's a bat bat bat same bat. Save basic fortitude? All the pencil is smacking. That's right.

Well, that would be All three of us. No. That would be all four of you. Please make the basic fortitude safe. So click on that thing.

Click on the thing. Click on the button in the chat. Ain't great. Oh. At least it wasn't a correct fail.

I'll take that. Also, it's not gonna be super damaging, at least. It did not. Oh, Jason? K.

I clicked it once, but nothing happened. There you go. Oh. Oh, god. Pardon me.

I failed. I might survive. Might not. You'll be fine. Probably not.

Alright. So for he who failed. Mhmm. No one did. Let's see here.

Oh, I did. Oh. I definitely did. No one definitely did fail. Just as damage.

Yeah. Yeah. I'm gonna start to disappoint. 11 of them, though. Oh.

Oh. That's half my life. Apparently. I'm not sure we should be hidden from them. Yeah.

I think that's probably a I think it just gave us the hidden condition because we're in darkness. But Yeah. My guess is we are not. Yeah. How does that work?

Like, it's a magical effect, so it does not matter what your natural status or ability is. It's going to darken it anyway. So I think in Pathfinder, dark vision can see through the darkness spell, but dark vision is much rarer. I believe. I could be wrong.

It's actually it in in this specific example, the they can't see through the darkness spell, but because it's an AOE effect, it's, you know, the hidden condition doesn't apply on this. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Gotcha. Yeah. They can not see that any better than than I can.

Yeah. Basically, the way the darkness spell works here is if you are if you cast a, a light spell that is greater than the spell level of the darkness spell that was cast, then it overcomes it. But otherwise, it's complete darkness. So So so right now, everybody is completely dark out. Correct.

Everybody else. Okay. Yep. Yep. But like like I said, she she cast an AOE harm.

She cast a three action AOE harm. So she basically just kinda threw it out there, throw a template, and then everybody who was in the template who failed to save or, yeah, that's kinda how that worked out. Yeah. Okay. So, with that, Karsten, we're up.

I mean, this happened, like, relatively really quickly, the darkness and all the stuff. Right? Like, I would remember that there is a a thing right in front of me or there should be, right, After roll off You could assume that there's a guy right in front of you. This is the span of, like, six seconds. So unless he's really quick.

Yep. I'm going to assume, so I'm just going to whack at. Right? Mhmm. And also, I think in Pathfinder, even though they're hidden from you, they're not you still know they're there.

They're just hidden. Okay. Right? But you have, like, a 50% miss chance. It's pretty gnarly.

Yeah. That is pretty crappy. Mhmm. On top of having to hit their AC still. Mhmm.

Do what? On top of having to hit their AC still. Okay. So do I have to put anything in the modifiers then? No.

I I have everything covered on my end. Oh, okay. So you you missed the flat check. So you missed Or you you see the movement in the darkness and you take it and you take a swing against him. But, what you thought was what you thought was, the body of the guy that you were attacking ended up being some random piece of rubble.

Your sword clangs off of the clangs off of the rubble. Okay. Was it was it 28 he misses? Yep. He can't hit.

Yeah. There's no. No. This is this is a hidden condition. The hidden condition forces a flat check-in which you have to roll an 11 or above in order to be able to even have a chance to hit.

So he rolled a two on that, and then he rolled a 22 dice. So Oh, okay. Right. Right. Right.

So it's not impossible. You fell in ice. No. You succeeded on the flat check, but you failed to actually hit him. This is wonderful, just so you know.

Well, it's good work. I'm gonna raise my shield for my last action. Okay. You know, compacts are not just swing your sword, though. These are puzzles that you need to solve Oh, a clue.

As well. Get it. Alright. Cool. So you swing, you swing, and you raise your shield.

Oh, good road. Alright. So, something happens there. Here. This guy is going to a he's going to take a swing at yeah.

So he's going to try and stab, Karsten with his short sword, and he's going to miss. Yay. And move. And he's going to shoot Karsten with his no. He's not.

He's going to move out. Alright. Next up is Cahir. Two questions. Okay.

Can we move into this black face that we can't see? You can move, but you might run into some walls. Because that guy seemed like they moved into it, but Yeah. I have the I I have the black right. So the so, yes, you can move in.

There there's a the reason why the fog of war is where it is, is because, it is because you see nothing but a big black bubble. So if you move beyond that big black bubble, then parts of the map will be revealed. Just to me or to everybody? Well, I can't reveal it just to you. Otherwise, I would.

But Yeah. Okay. Mhmm. And then do we know which one is creating the darkness? You do not.

Okay. It's that guy that was just standing next to us And yeah. And yeah. Seemed like it went around. So okay.

So I'm gonna do something stupid and try to move out of the darkness. What should I do? K. Just try to pull my guy into a spot and see what happens? Or Pull the guy into a spot, and then I'll reveal what happens.

Is this dumb, Ramsey? I don't know. Part of the puzzle. Oh, not numb at all. Flat out retarded.

Nah. Good. Alright. Oh. Oh, shoot.

Didn't mean to move right in between everyone. It's perfect smashing opportunity. Yeah. Right. Well, something does happen, though.

Yeah. If somebody was holding an action or just such an opportunity. Well, let me he did not hold his action. He has a pack of opportunities, so he's gonna take that opportunity. Chris, my my guy seems to have lost about 10 hit points, maybe 11, somewhat inexplicably explicably yeah.

Explicably. Yeah. Well, you you took damage from the harm spell. And so I did fail then. Let's see.

You still took half of success. And you Yeah. You should have taken more. Yeah. You should have taken five damage from the harm spell.

Alright. It looks like I took the full hit of it because I was at 30 something, 30 Me too. Going. I only took five. Good job.

I said you only took five. Same here, it takes five damage. Maybe you said it twice. Twice, though. Yeah.

Yeah. Oh, you're right. Because I was thinking that they because it was still rolling that. So we'll just revert. That's not be done.

I just wanna make sure we know. K. Oh, there you go. Okay. So you ran through and here as you you ran out of the darkness and as you run out of the darkness, the, the black skinned, the black skinned elf, one of a a different black skinned elf, basically tries to run you through with a rapier, but you are successful in, you're successful in evading that attack.

Now you've got two more options. So I think I tried to turn on my Titan swing by clicking it, because I have it in one of those little boxes. Did I do that correctly? Let me see. It's in the chat.

It, you will if you go to your, if you go to your actions thing, you'll see a Titan Swing checkbox at the top. Oh, it's up there. I'm sorry. Okay. Yeah.

And check the checkbox, and then swing your swing your great axe. That will cost you two actions to use to attack when you've got the Titan Swing. Let's hit it, baby. Oh, you suck. Ouch.

That sucks. I mean, you throw the hero point. I'm a reroll it to hero point. You do that. Big money.

You suck. Oh, okay. Better. Results are not. Big damage.

Big damage. Big money. What would've added to that anyway, wouldn't it? Right. You run through and take a take a mighty what what does your what does your Titan swing look like?

I think it's like a jumping up really high and coming down right in the center of the person's head. Okay. No. Absolutely. You can totally do that.

The the titan swing ability is given to you by Raythellian, so it should be some sort of sun based effect that causes that. Jump up towards the light and stuff. Pull it down. Alright. Mhmm.

So you so you jump into the air and whatever light is around you kind of encapsulates your the head of your ax, and you swing down and you swing down and a ball of sun erupts when you hit him. Sounds good to me. Not feeling good, person. Well, that guy is probably enough. Yeah.

Right? Something seems to damage that make everybody feel bad. Yep. Oh, also something that I don't know if you guys have noticed, but if you hover over, any of the specific any of the characters, you'll see not only the not only the, their state, but also how far they are away from you. Mhmm.

Mhmm. I did see. So Yeah. I did see that. And that was very helpful.

Yeah. I think that will that will make it so that, so that, Ramsey, you don't have to, you don't have to use the measuring tools nearly as much. Yeah. It's really nice, Chris. This whole little program is really nice.

Indeed. Alright. This guy is gonna go over here. Yay. Get boxed in here, guys.

Well, you're the goon who decided to just run all the way over there. Oh, it's rule fine. Rule and rule fine is you never leave your team. You never leave your wingman. I I couldn't even see you guys.

I ran towards the line. There. It was, like, six seconds, and you're like, I think I should run off. Well, you can't follow me because you're so slow. Oh.

That's it. I need a new partner. Alright. Good news in the Dutch space. In front of you.

You or you. Hurt. It hurt. I need a I need a snack. I'm gonna go get a snack.

Are we okay for a minute? Good idea. Long way through. I'm having some of my cherry pie. Oh, I have, alright.

So he so he pulls back with his rapier and lunges forward to to run you through, but you are able to sidestep just enough that his blade hits nothing but air. Oh, here. Lucky. Holy cow, dude. Lucky.

Getting lucky. Better lucky than good. Really lucky. Right. Alright.

Sameer, you are up. You can only see that big black bubble that's in front of you. You're hearing fighting happening happening on the other end, but you are unsure as to what has happened. Right. Well, there's nothing for it but taking a stroll into.

Right? I have a rough idea of where, friends were. So I've got a 30 foot move, and that's about the best that I got. Right? Yeah.

So, yeah, I think, would, try to go to this location here. Okay. You run into Karsten along your way, but, are able to basically do one of those one of those weird run into a guy and then circle around and spin and keep going. Yeah. Hey.

Come with me. Open my hand, baby. What the hell do I do? I am So this, yeah, I don't I just don't know. So I sign I have this this lovely, sign of the sun.

Yeah. Right? Is that the thing that everybody has? Mhmm. Yeah.

It is. It's the same thing. Okay. So He gave us a hint. Cast it.

I'm I'm yeah. I think I'm gonna go with that now that I'm in the middle of the darkness. Okay. So active use your sign of the sun. Oh, how do where are oh, here you are.

Play button. I play buttoned it. Bam. Oh my gosh. Yeah.

You activate sign of the sun, and the dark and the darkness just completely disappears. Oh, wow. That was beautiful. Alright. So I wanted to get into that earlier, Carson.

Correct. That's why I already got it on. No. No. You didn't.

No. It's had a light up. To be fair, though, I didn't think that was going to work. I Yeah. Maybe either.

I thought the other one's stronger. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Apparently, our side of the sun is greater than second level. Right. That level. Right. We're not called levels here.

Wrong game. Wrong game. Whatever. It won't work on, like, really high level things, but in this specific example yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Sick. Okay. Now that I can Alright. See what the flip is going on, I'm like, dude, to here.

Where did that come from? Hot, man. Changes to here. Right. So that's two actions.

That gum. Everything else I can do is two Pull me towards you? I wish I had that kind of telekinetic capacity or that number of of actions. So what it looks like is I could do, like, a blazing bolt one to three actions. Is that am I seeing that right, Chris?

Mhmm. Yep. Yep. K. How do I how do I differentiate between one and three actions for this thing?

When you cast it, it'll ask you which Okay. Which one you wanna do. Hit the dude and and tap him. Alright. So I I've got him targeted, and then I can go to my spell and cast that.

Right? Yep. Blazing bolt. One. And I go ahead and attack.

Right? Yep. Oh, it's nice. I can do it. Jeez.

Critical miss. Wow. You don't get any worse than that. No. No.

That's the point that we want. True. Yeah. You can use your hero point. Where is that hero point hiding?

It's it seems like a good idea. If you right if you right click on the on on the, on the spell attack card on the spell attack card in the chat, if you right click on that, then it'll give you an option to reroll using hero point. Am I doing that wrong? Just right click on the Go go over to your chat. Uh-huh.

Go over the go over the chat where you see your your the the entry that you missed. The blazing bolt? Says critical mist. Not blazing bolt. Critical mode.

Okay. Critical miss. Yeah. Where it says critical miss, right click on that, and it'll give you an option to reroll using hero point. Much better.

Mhmm. Oh my god. Get it out now. Jeez. Alright.

Then roll damage? Then roll damage. Yeah. Hey. Big damage, though.

Nice. Six dice stand. That is nice. Which was enough. Oh, beautiful.

That is so helpful for you. Now Now the next guy can swoop in. Alright. That lure's gonna kill them all. One swoop.

I'm not gonna go Don't worry. You're up. Alright. And she is up next. 30 foot.

Let's try it. It may not work, but that's okay. We need to move closer by 15 feet, it looks like. So we'll move here. We're gonna target this one.

Oh, wait. No. I can't do it because I had to move. I don't have enough actions. Well, new plan, same as the old plan.

We're gonna we're gonna we're move a little closer, and we're going to, whack a whack a and just cast, the old electric arc on those two. I do like a good electric arc. Yeah. Me too. I wanna do something else, but I didn't have the third action I needed after I moved, unfortunately.

I I see you there. Alright. Alright. I'm gonna roll some damage. Love to see it.

Lots of pretty decent damage too for a cam trip. Oh, yeah. That is. Holy crap. Wow.

Nice. Love it. Wow. And that's so that's me. That's all I got.

Good work. So she, she reacts immediately. All of them really reacted immediately to the, to the, bright light that suddenly appeared. They all scream out and kinda cover their eyes, and, like, it's too bright. That would hurt their eyes.

And they seem pretty discombobulated at the moment. Mhmm. And she is going to, see. She has very limited options at the moment, but she knows about where you guys were. So she's going to randomly lash out.

Can she not see? She's blinded by the light. Oh. I did that. And she's going to cast fairy fire.

One of the most misheard lyrics in history. Probably. All creatures in the Internet and Caswell. Very few people here revved up like a deuce. Yeah.

Yep. No. That is not what they hear. That is what it said. That is not what they hear.

No. No. Alright. Boys of summer is another one that's really bad. She's going to Paul, run away.

To a, darker corner. Darker corner. So she cast verifier. Basically, what this means is everybody who's in the area, which is Karsten, Samir, and Alwar, for the next five minutes, you are lined out with a colorful heatless fire, of any color of your choice. You can be whatever color you want.

I think it's my choice, but I don't care. Visible, you can't be concealed while affected by fire fire, and you are and if you're invisible if you are invisible, you are considered concealed and rather than being undetected. So basically, just as far as like hiding for hiding purposes, you're one degree higher than what you would normally be, which in this specific example doesn't really do much. But it was her only template spell that wasn't that wasn't harm. She probably could've harmed again, but wanted to try something else.

So there we go. She cast very fire and runs away. Carson, you're up. Hey. And she is no longer she's no longer blinded.

She's dazzled. And double move and whack that guy. Get him. Oh, he is off guard. I guess he's already blind, so he's probably already off guard.

I don't know. Not sure how that works. Yeah. I don't know. It does the math, so, you know.

Winter dawn striking my foe. Oh. That's that is a crit. That's, yeah. That'll do.

He's already not feeling good. Oh, he's feeling a whole lot less good. Yeah. It'll take, like, a match. Boom.

It's still That's still nice and tense. Three more buff. Wow. Scott, I think your perception of what good damage is is skewed by you being a giant instinct barbarian. No.

I was just, like, three damage. Sixteen's good. I was just coming in the three. Odds for Oh, roll them again. Fair enough.

You got a roll tire. You are right. 16. You are right. 10 is really good.

So, Clark, how do you wanna have killed him? I wanna slice off his head and have it go rolling to that girl. So I scream. Right. I love feet.

It's a big slice. So it instills fear in her. Righteous fear. Wait a minute. No.

Maybe not right this fear, but fear. Something like that. Okay. Here, you're up. I'll get it.

I'll get it. Let's do the old simple strike a rooskies. Bam. Bam. Thank you, man.

Your giant ax, and then you can scream too. And you have the head go flying for Big money. Big money. Money. That would be funny.

Oh my gosh. Right? Thanks. Is that seriously your damage 21? Wait.

Wait. Wait. Let's let's just let's just take a moment here and enjoy the fact that here pulled a 21 to hit and did 21 damage. Yeah. Perfect.

That's beautiful. That's all Yeah. That'd be over the top. That was just one quick action. That's what your your mom said.

That's for number two. There's no such thing as overkill. Oh, Chris, when I strike this one, I can use my second strike. Correct? Yeah.

You use your second one. Right? Give her a shot. That's a good job. Hey.

Still oh my god. All that damage. Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Go. Oh my god. There's nothing Nicholas. You slash into her heavily. Oh, she's at the desk.

She's at the store. Oh, don't worry. She is. She's she's got two PCs ahead of her. So, Yeah.

Jeez. I don't I don't like her chances. Speaking of, Sameer, you are up. She's terribly concerned. She's finished her.

You will need to move to get line of sight on her, though. She is Go right up the store. Oh, maybe you don't need line of sight. May maybe you've got line of sight on her. Maybe.

But Okay. She just got slashed through the through the torso with a giant ax. She reels back in pain and Up to you. She's got, like, one leg hanging off almost. So do I do I need to move to get line of sight?

It I can see You do not need to move to get line of sight. I think that you're okay with that, but she is 45 feet away from you. So Right. If you're looking for something that's shorter, I need that. Yeah.

I don't think it's gonna make a difference on me either. I if I add add the reach to my spell, right, that would take an action. Am I understanding that? Yes. Yeah.

I think so. Use your Metamagic. I think I think your Metamagic costs an action. So I'll, I'll go ahead and do that. It's the same as me moving.

Yeah. I use the telekinetic projectile. So right there, click here. Cahir, what did you do? Was that is is that slashing damage?

Is Is that what you do? I don't I'm assuming so. Sharp objects? No. Yeah.

I think so. Slashing damage. Alright. I'm going to do I'm gonna do that. Do that.

It's attack. Pull something other than a one, please. Oh, good. A three. My gosh.

Alright. Well That's it. Yeah. Lloyd Boulder of, you know, the size of your hand skids across the the ground and slams in the wall behind her. Very distracting.

It definitely does have quite a bit of force to it for sure. Mhmm. But, like, basically, it's just kinda one of those things where she she starts she reels back from the huge hit that she took, and you were aiming the projectile right where her head was It just whizzed straight by. Unfortunately, your teamwork was not up to snuff at that moment. Now we're Europe.

Alrighty. Well, I think I like the chances of that better. So we're just gonna move up a little bit, and, we're gonna cast electric arc again. As we do it, we're gonna take some of the, like, purple light that's flowing around us and, like, make the the bolt just a little purpley from the the, you know, very fire. That's what it's called.

Yeah. Right. A little bit of SIP in there. Why not? Because the SIP are bad.

That's why. The Lord Knight's soft. She crit succeeded. What does that mean? Alright.

She gets another turn. She was determined. Man. She just called me I was safe. Sorry to lie.

Oh, that's weird. I don't even think Carson can get over there. Can you? Uh-uh. Oh, I don't know if he's got it.

Oh, yeah. He's he's 20. He can get over there and swing. So he wouldn't be able to do much else than that, but he can do that. Okay.

So she is going to she was gonna do that, but I don't think she's got another turn in her. Mhmm. So let's, How did she know die? She's just that good. I roll like I normally roll.

That's how Crit failure. Crit success. Let's see. We are going to so tempted to use that, but we won't but that's that's not she's going to cast a three action harm again. Mhmm.

Mhmm. That's probably the thing to do. Go out with the bang. Or you might be out of range from here. No.

No? The 30 foot emanation. Yeah. I'm just a 30 foot feet away. Right?

Oh, it's a it's a it's a 30 foot oh, no. Yeah. You're right. You're right. Yeah.

The point blank. Yeah. It's an emanation. It's not Right. Right.

So fireball. Why do they just go fuzzy? That's weird. It has to emanate from hers. Yeah.

Yeah. Can't you can't place it somewhere else. It would get me in here. Yeah. Would not get Karsten.

Yep. But Maril now. Maril. I'm a long ways out. 45, 45 feet from her, I think.

Let's see. Is there any way that she can save herself here Rather than just going supernova. No. I think that's pretty much it. Alright.

Well, so yeah. So we'll need both, our and Kihir to make reflex or make fortitude saves. So go ahead and click on that button there. See how you do now, Kihir, you big goon. Yeah.

I was counting on my team Alright. Rolling restlessly. Boom. He's really good with fortitude anyways, so he's screwed. Yeah.

Don't roll like me, dude. That's not that I rolled it. Great. Alright. So here, you failed.

Yep. And Alwar, you succeeded. I'm gonna go with oh my gosh. This is terrible. To here, you get you get hit with you get wracked with pain, but it's manageable.

You take four points of damage. I'll worry. You are also racked with pain, but this is something that you've dealt with before, and you know how to compartmentalize your mind away from your pain. So you take two points of damage. Okay.

And, Karsten, you are up. You know what would be funny? If I just ran into here, you could shove him, and he could just his axe would just hit the girl. I mean, is that a possibility? No.

But I just That is not at least not with your class. Well, that's just silly wonkiness. He's something like drunken master. I'm gonna run and spend two actions. I'm gonna nudge, to hear as I go by, and then I'm gonna scream and whack this lady.

I have a big smile on my face like, sucker. I can figure out where all my buttons are. I know. Right? Alright.

Here we go. Now I get a loose buttons aren't hidden behind buttons. Oh. Oh, boo. That was silly.

Did you did you go like me? You didn't. I mean, you have a hero. Well, we also have three more of hers. Yeah.

We also have three more heroes. That's true. But we've said that before. I am I'm I've got three shots at her. Alright.

She is amazing this time. You use your hero point? What are you doing? I'm doing her. And we've been playing for an hour.

You Against her. We Right. Way to go. Way to go. It's good.

It's better than average. It's dead. I just want you to know that you damage, not 21 every time. How how did you how did you get lucky? I go off, a disagreement.

I cut off her head as well. Then I go rolling. Okay. I didn't have an official of that. Could you could you try it again?

Let me get on Discord first. Okay. Go. You can't see Greg. She's a witness detection program.

I guess so. Oh, god. Sorry, Chris. Go ahead. Flex my muscles too, Kiair, after I'm done killing her.

Right. Trying to be as intimidated, and I know I'm not. I'm a wee little man. Your hair is cut too nice. Right.

So Do anything with this experience, or is it just tell me that? Just tells you that. It's auto assigned. Oh. Let's see.

See if I can get up as your chest. What? Pull things into it. I don't see a chest. I see it hasn't pulled anything into it yet.

No. We really need a bag of holdings. Do those things exist on this plane? Mm-mm. They do.

Okay. We've got their they aren't they well, they might be things that characters of your level can get, but hasn't come up. It'd be nice when we have all these battles to find one, stick all this junk in. Or maybe you don't pick up every little thing that shows up and only pick up the the nice stuff. Chris, that is not a capitalistic mindset.

That is actually capitalistic a capitalistic mindset. Only taking the valuable stuff and leaving the junk behind? Oh, that's totally capitalism. No. That's that's completely what is happening over here.

Okay. Alright. So there is a it's hard to see, but there's a treasure chest in the middle of the room. Mhmm. Oh, yeah.

That is hard to see. It's not doing anything, though. It's a secret invisible one. Oh, yeah. It is.

It's seven twenty five feet away from it. 50 feet. Not doing anything? No. It's just staying invisible.

That's on Mimic. That's right. Uh-oh. Wait then. Doesn't want to be found.

Playing hard to get. Just like to hear. Oh, he's not even there. Where'd he go? Not for sure we're gonna be addressing our lives.

Let me configure ownership. K. Try now. It's not moving. Yep.

No. Just don't. Oh, studded leather armor. Chainmail. That'll have a bulk for you there.

Religious, simple Yeah. So yeah. So from from the, from the woman, she had a religious symbol to some sort of spider god. She also had some lethargy poison and, some bolts, a shield, and hand crossbow. And she she was also the one with the chain mail.

Oh, wow. Then the two warriors were the ones with the style leather or note the the one guy that dropped the that that you killed first had the style leather. The other two had just leather armor, and they were equipped with rapier short swords and crossbows as and crossbows. So Barely cannot carry anything out. So reloads.

Okay. I can probably carry more stuff, but I don't know where to find that use effect. Inventory. There is no value? 10.

No. Nothing nothing really stands out. The what you have here is just standard standard adventurers equipment. So nothing nothing special, nothing fancy. They don't even have any gold on them.

Yeah. I'm gonna take some of that poison. Leathers are poison. No, Future exploration. Particular reason.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty good. Direct injury.

Okay. Yeah. That's pretty good. Okay. Oh, there is a field.

While, while he's making that decision I'll do that. Okay. What are the rest of you doing? I'm good. I picked up what I wanted.

I'm ready to go. Is this, a wall back here, Chris, or is this gonna be No. That's that's a, well, let me let me, let me show you. Oh my gosh. So this is a hallway that continues on.

It appears to have, a little bit of a, tables, followed by an alcove that it or an alcove to the north that appears to be there that you can see. Okay. Before we move on, were we taking a couple of minutes to rest, heal up? That's a good question. Mhmm.

Looks like three of us have seen better days. Yeah. Pears barely hurt. What it seeing better days? Yeah.

Oh, gosh. That's so funny. I'm gonna magically heal you. Oh, please. Magically heal all of me.

I I don't know how to do it, though. Yeah. I don't know. Why does that not work? So you didn't drop it into the big blank square.

I'm laying my hands on you. Please be gentle. Focus. Press the play button? I don't know.

Are you out of focus points? I don't know. Don't get upset with me for not knowing your character, sir. Where do we find the focus points? The that's in the spell section.

Woah. I can take 12 points now? Look. Oh, that's great. Holy cow.

I don't I don't know how to apply it to Jason. Is it is it his turn? Does he do that? Jason, can you click on the apply healing? Yeah.

Looks like it didn't pull. That's beautiful. Good job. Thanks, Clark. I'm, like, full health now.

Yeah. 12. Wow. That went up. It was six last time.

Holy crap. I feel so much better now. And I knew you did. Yeah. You are refocusing and then casting it again?

Yeah. I gotta cast it, probably, hopefully, just three times. We only get one shot. Depends. I'm also gonna refocus while we're here and get my focus point back.

There you go, Mark. Doing that. Yeah. That's what I'm thinking. Thank you, sir.

Do you need more or are you good? I'm down five. Oh, yeah. I'm gonna be down a couple as well. But are do you want more or is that good?

Yeah. That'll probably be alright. K. What am I doing? Refocus myself.

Right? How many hit points does have? I'm 42 out of 47. Oh my god. 10 hit points more than me.

Good lord. Yeah. Yeah. Just get used to being the being the squishiest of all the guys. It's just what's gonna happen.

And, but Yeah. You're just squishy. I am. But but how am I, like, way more squishy than the small gnome squish? Or Gnomes are gnomes are in fact very hardy creatures.

I I got that that constitution. I have a plus two constitution. How'd you get that and still have it? I can kiss the spell feature. Alright.

I'm ready. I was thirty minutes. Right. Did you refocus again after your last one? Of course.

Right there. I hope. I don't know what that is, but I'm ready. I'm focused. Somehow I have a a thing that has a lay on hands is crossed out.

Yeah. That's because you don't have any focus points. Oh, wait. Oh, there it is. There we go.

Okay. There you go. Okay. I'm good. I'm good.

I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good, Chris.

I'm good, buddy. Alright. What did you do? What did you do to fix your focus point problem? The focus point problem is it says focus right above that spell.

So I clicked it. Found it. But you had, if you had zero Yeah. If you left click on the focus spell thing, it'll it'll give you it'll add it'll add your focus points up until your max. If you right click on it, it'll remove it.

Gotcha. Okay. Just right above my thing, it said focus spell, and then it hasn't, like, greater than and equal or greater than and less than one. Like, you click on that. Anyway.

Alright. So you guys proceed down the hallway? Hallway of awesomeness. Yep. Alright.

About halfway down the hallway, you find an alcove with a, could be a dining table, could be a war room table. Not quite sure. There are a number of papers and things on the top of it though. The chairs around it, there are in fact four chairs around it that seem to have been knocked over and hasted. Uh-oh.

We surprised our our world Can we read the papers? Yeah. So go ahead and roll Agent crouched. Go ahead and roll, Perception? Go ahead and roll go ahead and roll perception.

Yeah. See what you find. Why is it private? I can't see my rolls. Because you rolled in private.

Because you rolled perception. Perception in this game, you technically shouldn't know what you rolled. Oh. Alright. Like, how it automatically does the secret rolls like that?

Yeah. It is really cool. It's a lot cooler than like, when you're playing this game live, you're supposed to, the GM is supposed to be doing the perception roles for you because it's supposed to be secret, and they're supposed to know when you're not. That just never felt good. But this, you're at least rolling.

So Right. Must be I rolled in the wrong spot. This mine showed up. Yep. You're fired.

Iron figures. I think it's probably the the green eye is the perception roll. I know that one. Probably where Not the other perception roll. There's search Alright.

So rolled out perception there. I rolled it correctly this time. Alright. Good job. Okay.

So you guys started, rifling through the paperwork. And a lot of it is, a lot of it's more like logistical stuff, like, troop movements of the of what you can assume the goblins were. I hear you and no. Karsten, I should say. Karsten, you specifically noted note, there are some there are some paperwork and reports here of things that you were, part of.

Right? What? So there's, so basically, it's it's definitely, like, these these out were seem to have been directing the the goblin horde that you hordes that you guys have been, fighting for the past six months. Wow. I communicate that to our to the group.

You specifically happened across, something amongst the pages that doesn't really track with everything else in there. Okay. It's a torn journal page. Oh, okay. Inside that torn journal page, you you see, what appears to be written in a human hand, not a, not an oven hand.

It's again, you know, seems to be torn from a actual journal itself, and appears to be the musings of some sort of scholar or explorer, chronicling their investigation of into dark rumors. The, the part of the journal that really kind of piques your interest is, e b is a is a is a, a line in there that says the betrayer stirs and the ruins of Kothilar. His servants, beasts of the underdark, dig ever deeper to restore him to power. May the gods preserve us. This really catches your attention because if you remember, there was a separate journal that you had that you guys had perused, earlier on in these tunnels that also mentioned a, I believe it was a Tower Of Kulthalar.

Mhmm. So Kulthalar had popped up a few different times, and not in the and not in the hand of the actual enemy itself. Mhmm. Mhmm. Right.

Do we I mean, do we recognize that as a place? And that is what you guys find. So Okay. Okay. Do we do we recognize that name, Chris?

Is that a place or name with. Hey. Let me see. If I can open the map, a, is the thing I can do? Sorry.

I but I my audio was off for Ah, okay. I was asking, do we recognize that name? Is it a place or something, or do we just not have any idea? I'd say that that is something that a bardic knowledge or a lore history could, Kelly. Yeah.

Sounds like a bardic knowledge to me, which is essentially a lore history. Oh, yeah. I love that skill. Alright. Action.

Action. Action. Action. Action. Article or oh, hey.

That's weird. That defaults to public, and it really shouldn't. It should be, blind, maybe. Is that right? That looks right.

Yep. Sweet. Alright. So what you know, you've you have heard Kofilar, in a few different, a few different, places. One thing that one thing that it it tells you, Kofilar specifically is in, is in the Elven tongue.

But it's not the common Elven. It's like a it's like an old it's effectively like the old English version of it's old Elven. So it doesn't have a it doesn't have a straight translation, and I see what your you have. You do not have Elven as your as a language that you know. Uh-huh.

So it it's, it's in it's definitely an Elven tongue, thing. You have heard, of the, of the of a bard's tale of of Khoslaar, where a, enemy of, an enemy of the light resides in a in a tomb of darkness, in a in a, in a mountain where it's dug so deep that the, that the sun cannot reach it. And the, and and the Bart and the Bartic tale that you remember is specifically of, somebody who braves braves the, braves the dungeon, jumps into goes down in there to find treasures and and defeat the, defeat the dark lord of the of the, of Colthalar. But, his but is never seen or heard from again. But there's many, many attributions to that person's, to that person's valor as they walk through the, as as they, see the terrors unknown.

So that is what you've been able to that that is what you know about Kofilar. So it seems to be some sort of dark stronghold that exists in a mountain, that, is written in or that is named in some ancient elvish script. Okay. Alright. More research necessary?

Yeah. Our last little foray into that particular situation. Something that Was just just betrayer was Mhmm. In this place. It'd be, the place where this presumed dead betrayer might be, doing his work.

Right. And just to, like, I I don't want I I don't wanna be just handing you something that isn't, like, isn't helpful. Yeah. And this is something that you would know, being a person of this world. There is an Elven nation on the continent that is on the western side of the continent.

Ah, okay. There's a there's a mountain range that, basically separates the elven nation from the rest of the continent. And the elven nation is a peninsula out into the, up to the west. So Do we have reason to suspect that it survived the, you know, rain of fire? You have no reason to suspect any such thing.

You don't know. Maybe it did, maybe it didn't. Exactly my point. Alright. Alright.

Anything else? Any other questions? I was taking a walk over here and look around to make sure that, you know, nobody's doing anything. Mhmm. And there is, in fact, nobody that's chasing you this time around.

Alright. Nobody's coming from behind. Can we see where they fled to? The dead seem to still be dead. Perfect.

Excellent. Just go ahead. You would be dead. Oh, what was the question, Scott? Can Can we see where they fled to?

Like, does anybody have the ability to see that they went the way we're going? The, assumption would be that they jumped out of their chairs and came to fight us and are in the other room dead. Yes. Mhmm. Okay.

That is the, that is the prevailing theory at the moment. And I just checked, they seem to still be dead. They are, in fact, still dead. And there is a yeah. And at the end of the hall, there is at the end of the hall, there is a corner here as well.

Okay. So that is not another, tunnel? It's it's a corner. Okay. Alright.

Excellent. Well, I believe there was a oh, it was, like, beds or something down there? Close. Sarcophaguses. Oh, forever beds.

Permanent beds. Yeah. So Yeah. Yeah. Alor.

The perma beds. Excuse me. Pardon me. The other way. Okay.

So, as you guys continue down this hallway, again, you know, this is definitely a, it's definitely a space that is, very very heavily worked. The sarcophagus is that you pass, all seem to have some sort of, some sort of reference to, darkness. And you do see, there's a symbol that keeps on popping up, in the sarcophagus, but also, like, along the along the walls and different things. And the symbol is that of a shattered sun. At the end of the at the end of the hallway, there is a door.

No writing on the sarcophagus is? Just the the sun symbol? Just the sun symbol. Okay. Yeah.

Well, don't like that. Right. Do you want to open one or two? Yeah. Oh, hold.

Do you Curiosity. Want to open one or two? Time out. If you open them, you gotta make sure your super light is on. I don't think it shut off yet.

Alright. Well, we don't wanna open it. Yes. I think it's But just to be clear, the the elves that you guys were fighting, they were very much alive. They were not undead.

Why would they be in this coffin thing? Well, yes. That's fair. That's fair. That's a good point.

Chances of elves lying down in coffins and them not being undead are slim. So solid point. Yeah. No. I would I would presume that we exhumed bodies from somewhere and have brought them with us.

They're bringing corpses with you? Yeah. I don't well, no. Who the Drow when they moved up here to Drow, they brought them with them. Oh, that's possible.

That would matter. Yeah. It's possible. We're also have had some casualties among, their nobility since they got here. That is also possible.

Mhmm. Or they were planning their own deaths. They know the thing. That is possible. Yeah.

Horrible. Theories. Been here for much longer than we thought. Yeah. That's a good question.

Are these, new? Are these old? Are these, like, super all double ultra old? These are they are not super double ultra old, but they are def they definitely haven't been they definitely been here longer than just six months. Okay.

For sure. Okay. If you would like to roll a craft archaea or a, an archaeology lore, or a crafting or or a crafting skill check or a, or a bardic lore to or a catch all skill, you know, then feel free to lure. We will bardic lore. Okay?

So looking at these looking at these sarcophagus, they were def they were built into the stone itself. So this will definitely this definitely says that, like, these were a part of the main plan of of this entry. Something that your something that just kind of like your catch all knowledge and specifically, like, when it comes to crafting and artistry, something that you notice, is that the, the shattered sun symbols that are on the top have been recently carved. But the, but the actual tops of the sarcophagus is themselves, are a lot older. So they have been defaced is what you what you're thinking.

Okay. Kinda like the sphinx with the head being smaller than the rest of the body. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Okay. Okay. Got it. They may have reburied. But I'm awful.

Interesting. Sameer, I'm kinda with you now. I originally wasn't on the the, tomb raiding plan, but I'm curious now because I don't Can I, I'm gonna just go ahead and do a detect magic Okay? On on my sales and and everything around me. I don't you know, that makes sense, anyway.

Oh, really cool effect. Yeah. I don't know I don't know what just happened, but I I did it. Magic. I don't know.

That's what happened. Okay. Great. Now you take the magic. So there are a couple things that you there are a couple things that you pick up.

There are, two of these sarcophaguses which don't radiate anything. It's this one. Oh. This one. Okay.

That one? Okay. These three A magic tear. Have the remnants, an after image of necrotic magic. What does that mean?

That was necromancy magic. Oh, necromancy. Yeah. Once upon a time. But it's it's more like residual.

Right. There's nothing act there are no active spells. Yeah. But there was something that was done in those three things. Is there is there a, like, a way that I would be able to determine or figure out if there's, like, a if there was a contingency spell or something of that nature where the magic would be dormant until x y z happens?

Or am I pretty confident that x y z happened, magic has been the spell was activated, and there's just the lingering after afterglow? Yeah. So the way that the way that I would categorize this is more of just an afterglow. It's not like, you know, you triggered some you you don't feel like you triggered something, you know? Right.

Okay. Okay. Tahir, are you with us? Yep. Sorry.

Okay. Did you did you look these over from a from a crafting standpoint? Could the two of us look these over together? I just wanna what I'm looking for is any sign that these have been tampered with beyond the the facing of the of the surface at the top. Okay.

Yeah. Go ahead and we'll, craft crafting check. Each of us. Right? Yep.

Either of you are stone smiths. Right? Alright. Well, we'll go with this. Good job, dude.

Jeez. Yeah. I don't I just have crafting. I don't have, like, stone smith or anything like that in particular. Well, no.

This this is just more of a background thing. Like, you've you've worked with stone very heavily, but, like, I think we've got blacksmith and then I'm not sure what sort of crafter you are. But magic. But, yeah, blacksmithing generally. Okay.

So a couple of blacksmiths. So go ahead and role crafting as well. Just okay. Here we go. I tried to do something.

It was like, hey. You know, throw your item in here. Like, I don't have an item. What are you talking about? Okay.

Oh, nice. Nice. Alright. So, basically, both of you guys, go over these. They there's there's been nothing added to these to these sarcophagus once they were built.

You're fairly confident that that has that that hasn't happened, that nothing has happened on it. Scott, or, yeah. Scott Cahir, actually is able to find on a few of the sarcophagus', like, on the top pieces. It's very clear that whoever was working on before was basically sanded them down pretty heavily. But, there are a couple places with your, critical success that you have.

There are a couple places that you were able to discern that, there were runes and etchings on the on these before, before they were defaced. And those etchings that you're looking at, they look like they are, they they look to be elven, and not like ancient elven like Kofilar is, but like the the elven the regular elven common tongue, but they are so weather weather born weather torn and and sanded down that it's hard to tell what they what they say, other than they look like their proper names. Like, looks like they added, it was it was somebody's name that was on there. So why do we wanna open them? Curiosity.

Curiosity. Yeah. It seems like they are older tombs that were reused. Mhmm. And I'm curious what's in there and not in there.

Right. If these dark elves over there are the goblin masters or masterminds or whatever Mhmm. But and they're not the type to bury goblins. Right. And if there are those elves in here, what killed them?

Yeah. Or, again, are they just being prepared? Or yeah. I'm not so much looking to loot dead bodies. That's, Yeah.

That's not really the goal there. That's the way we're just gonna be. I just thought there was more enemies to fight in there. Well, I mean, that could be too. There may be.

Yep. But so anyway, if you're, incredible brute force, Kihiro, do you mind helping me pop the lid off from this one right here? The middle one? Yeah. Why not?

What kind of training we gotta do with Chris? Oh, boy. Athletics. Athletics. That one's easy.

That's good. That's good. Don't even go to the skill section. You can just click the fist. Where's the fist?

Where's the fist? Show me a Oh, here's a fist. Found a fist. Athletics. Fantastic rules.

Great. Why? Because I'm not fighting something in our life doesn't depend on it. Okay. So here I'm choking a pressure.

You lift off the you Kakeru, you and Sameer are able to lift off the top of the sarcophagus of the middle one, and set the, set the lid to the side. What you find on the inside is really nothing. There's, there there's a empty sarcophagus, there's a stone a stone pillow, what it looks like, and a indentation, in that stone pillow as if it were carved out for a specific head. But there's no head and no body inside that sarcophagus. What?

Right. Well, I guess we can put that back on. Right. Is that one that was magic? I didn't see which ones were magic.

That yes. That was one of the magic ones. Yeah. Okay. Alright.

We do, another. You can open as many as you want. Let's see how many are empty. And let's do this one. Okay.

I'm just gonna work right down the line. Okay. Well, we'll just we'll just if you're gonna go through all of them, you're gonna go through all of them. The three that were magical are all empty. Okay.

The three that were not the three that were not magical have ancient well preserved elven dead people. Oh. Well preserved enough to tell that they're not these dark looking elves, but your standard variety elf? They are your standard variety elf. Although they do seem to be a little bit taller, a little bit harder than what, what you have been accustomed to seeing an elf look like.

It looks pretty good for the big guy. Yeah. They they have very they have very regal countenances. Yeah. Smears a little disturbed.

Yeah. So they were, doing something. Probably getting ready to use those. Yeah. Yeah.

I'm wondering if we got three undead, elves running around somewhere. That's that's essentially what I Mhmm. Sorted out. Yeah. That yeah.

That's fair. I hadn't really thought of that. Alright. That's that's my concern. Yeah.

Yep. On your guard. Shields up. Well, that does remind me. What what's your exploration activities happening right now?

We were exploring. I am pretty certain. What was my default? I think what would my default be? Let's see.

We've got void notice, cover tracks, defend, detect magic, follow the expert, hustle, investigate, repeat a spell, scout, search, track. That does, remind me one of the things that I did want to do in this room was see if there was any way I could, determine, foot foot traffic. Go ahead and roll, tracking. It's survival. We will be investigating.

Maybe searching. I was with the difference between those two. Investigator is recall knowledge. Search is, prepped ahead of doors and things. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. I guess we will search rather than investigate. K. Search.

Okay. Right. So anyway I don't I don't care if you wanna want that to be my exploration activity. Oh, track? Yeah.

I don't like, I don't care. I'm I'm fine with that to be my exploration activity. Otherwise, I'll do detect magic. Okay. Arsten?

I have no idea. I'm I'm exploring. Okay. You've typically chosen to defend as your exploration activity. Oh, well, then I will defend.

I'll do that too. Since I can't really do anything else. For yeah. So you'll I'll just raise your shield there. You're defending.

But here you don't have a shield, so defending isn't really gonna Oh, shoot. Do whatever you think I should do. Cover my tracks? Yeah. I'm fine.

I know. My tracks are too big. I think you've typically I think you've typically scouted. Yep. Sounds good.

Alright. Good. Good. Good. Okay.

So, Jason, as far as your tracking is concerned, you have been able to, the, the tracks that you're seeing right right here, this is a like, this entire hallway is pretty well, pretty well traveled. So it's, like, it's not like there's, if there's any dust or things that are settled anywhere, it's really in the sarcophagus alcove. You don't people don't really hang out there all that much, but the rest of the rest of the hallway is pretty well traveled. So you got heavy foot traffic through the hallway regardless. Right.

Good to know. Enemies are the way, guys. I don't know we're here. Come on. We've been quiet.

Yeah. The screaming dark elves there at the sudden explosion of light wasn't subtle, but they may not know we're coming. No. There's always a chance. Yep.

There's always a chance. I mean, when you think like that Alright. So you head up to the door. Oh, man. Let's see what's searched.

Mom, handsy cakes. Why are you in the way? Get out of there. Oh, sorry. I was just following footprints.

Okay. Alright. So as you approach the door, our go ahead and roll a perception Mhmm. As you are checking for hidden hidden things. Mhmm.

Find them. I do that well. Find them. Uh-huh. You you do that well.

Yes. So you approach the door. You check all the area all of the cracks and knobs and different pieces. The door is definitely one that can be opened and is not, in fact, locked. What?

Alright. And you do not you do not see any traps or mechanisms that could be traps. So looks good to me. We Uh-huh. Open it up.

Lose a hand, aren't I? Alright. Uh-huh. Pretty serious. It's alright.

You can heal it back. I actually can't. What? Would I be able to? I can't see anything.

Oh. Oh. You do not see a fragment of the map. I think. We see a whole bunch of other things.

See. You wanna go back? How about we go back? Look why you're asking. Shut the door.

Oh, yeah. It's not showing back up. I don't think they saw us yet. That's right. There you go.

I backed up. Thank you. Oh, I'm so glad we're not lucky. We got the mistake here. Let me see.

And with that, I think that it would be a great idea for everybody to roll initiative. Yeah. So Oh. We do. Where do we do that in a new area?

Yeah. That's the question. Do we have hero points now too? Yeah. We should.

Oh, everything went black. That's my fault. Alright. Where's my initiative button? Eight give me a second.

Just a sec. I worked on it. You did? I'm sorry. I'm doing like five things right now.

Okay? Give me a break. You are amazing. Sound like a teacher. I will laugh if you have all these buttons and there's no initiative button.

There's not. Well, there's the initiative button that you guys always had in the combat carousel. Yeah. But So so where do we go? This one up at the top.

Yep. Found it. I don't know pluses to anything. Wait. What?

Oh, somehow I clicked the wrong. I'm do icky. Thank you. Yep. I don't know how I was able to do that.

I just saw a dice when I clicked on it. Well, the funny thing is it didn't actually do anything. So Yeah. I don't know. Alright.

So you guys open the door and you see, two Elven Elven women who are about the same, who who are that same, like, taller, more filled out and real style people, you actually see three of them. There are two that are close to the door, and they are carrying some pretty wicked looking double bladed, scimitar style swords. And there is one in the distance that, that is not carrying anything but a knife. And in this room you also see a pretty large treasure chest by the, by this one. There's a large treasure chest in the room as well as an alcove, with a door, to the, to the east.

Let's begin the encounter. Cahir, you are up. What do you do? No. I feel like I wanna go stand right next to the treasure.

Whack that lady. She up next, though? One of them is. She'll go before you do. Right.

Last. Just a moment. Just a moment. He's doing five different things here. I'm afraid.

He's gonna try for the big swing on big money. Oh. Oh, yeah. He did. Oh, that's a critical hint.

Roll that thing. String. Alright. I'm getting there. Doing six things.

Oh, that was weak. Gosh. Wow. Well, that's not the loss that I'm getting on right now. I go and I do regular swings, and I get 21, and then I get You aren't currently raging.

You should be raging, but you're not currently raging. I didn't even click critical. I'm sorry. Can I reroll that? Oh, okay.

Yeah. That's You also you also should be raging, so apply your rage effect. K. There you go. Much better.

Now roll that damage. Hit critical though. Right? Yeah. Used to doing that.

That's better. That's better. My gosh. Better. There you go.

Oh my gosh. 58 points of damage? Oh my gosh. It was a chicken swing. Titan critical hit, Chris.

What do you want from oh my gosh. It's that's yeah. I am I am perfectly I am perfectly happy with what just happened. I was just kinda hoping that I'd have three l's to do something, not two. Instead of two.

Jeez. But I guess I'll just have to console myself in this. The contingency spell that goes off and she dies. Oh. No.

Treasure chest go. Treasure treasure chest. All of a sudden Bomb. Erupts into a thing with teeth and claws and all kinds of tattoos. Oh, no.

It was a dissection. Nice. What you get, you greedy greedy man? I think greedy. Maybe my swing accidentally hit that person because it was Amazing.

Yep. So, like and and I I'm very excited because I believe this this is the first time that I've ever seen a mimic in a game. Yes. Yes. So in all my years of D and D, I have never bought or used a mimic, which just seems tragic.

It looks like a cloud. Very exciting. So, basically, a mimic is, is a monster that pretends to be an object. And then when you get and it's kind of like a Venus flytrap. Right?

Usually, it pretends to be, you know, something that you wanna get, like a treasure chest. And when you get close to it, it attacks. And so it's it's an aberration sort of thing. But I was duped from a rookie I'm a rookie, and you duped me. You know, like I said, I've never good.

I've never seen one in game, and I was and I'm very excited to be able to use one now. So he's going to target you Privately. After you. And After you did 4,000 points of damage. And it is going to, it's going to I guess it's just gonna attack because that's what mimics do.

So it's just gonna much much crunch. So it swings out with a pseudo pod and hits with a critical. Oh. Oh. Oh.

Oh. Oh. Oh. It's gonna eat you a hole. Dealing 20 points of damage.

Oh. You basically like, this this this, Wow. This treasure chest is basically all of a sudden grows tentacles and teeth. It lunges at you and and grabs a hold of you. So it's going it it hits you because 20 points of damage, and then it's going to, going to grapple you.

We will do a athletics. He's pretty big big guy. Yeah. He does not he is not able to what's your athletics? Yeah.

He's not able to grapple you, but he will use his final action to attempt to smack you again. And it will hit, see here. Any creature that's hit with a mimic, breath wise touches the mimic must succeed a reflex save. So I need you to roll a reflex save. Not a bad roll.

Which you were not able to you were not able to defeat that. So you are you you basically, like, it's Pseudopod just latches onto you, and it's almost like you've got a a sucker tentacle. It's pulling you in. And it does 13 more points of damage to you Good lord. As it starts pulling you into its giant maw.

It's okay because Cahir's not feeling good. No. Chris, does he get to go in in out of turn like that because I stood next to him? No. He was holding his action.

So he so you finished your action, and he just inserted himself into into the initiative space right at right after you. So I just I just wondered if I would have stood in front of her instead of beside her, would that have changed it? Well, if you weren't within five feet of the treasure chest, then it wouldn't that was the trigger. So it was waiting for you to be within reach. So Yeah.

And I didn't even know Mimics existed. Right. Well, in your defense in in your defense, like I said, I've been playing D and D for twenty some odd years. I've never seen a mimic in game. So Never would have seen it coming.

But did you know it was there? You knew what the treasure chest was, obviously? Oh, I didn't. I assumed it was just treasure chest. I was just really happy with what it was.

Chris did. Right? I mean, you placed it there? Yeah. Yeah.

I put it there. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, okay. That's part of the encounter.

Yeah. It was part of the encounter. I didn't just throw in a random mimic. I'm hurting. I'm hurting.

That hurts. You used to be really good. Very good. Yeah. Other elf is gonna move in.

I am complete I'm really last. Target Carston. You're really last? Yeah. You are.

I'm last in the initiative order. Yeah. You are. So this is going to, so this this elf runs up to you with its double curved blade and does a flourish and attacks you, hitting you, but not creating you. Clark, do you wanna be used?

Block. Yes. Whatever that means. So Privately rolled some dice, it says. Mhmm.

Oh, sorry. Let me take that take that back. That's that's what happened. Okay. So it swings, with its sword.

You block one of its attacks, but its other attack comes back around and deals three points of damage to you. But she's not done. She then lashes out. Yeah. She then, basically lunges at you and tries to take a bite out of you with extremely sharp teeth.

Well, thank you. Alright. While I get a hold of her, I'm gonna punch some missus out. Okay. I'm a party.

We're not that close yet. She misses, but she is going to attempt to create a diversion. Oh, she already did three actions. Oh, you're right. You're right.

You're right. You're right. We moved attack to attack. That's absolutely correct. I forgot about the move.

Thanks for keeping me honest. It's okay. Sameer, you are up. I am up. Yeah.

You have basically, what you've seen so far is here, ran out, destroyed one of these things, and then was suddenly attacked by a, by a piece of furniture and Uh-huh. Completely decimated by it. Yeah. Yeah. Like, he's not feeling good.

No. He's not feeling good. And then the and then some sort of vampire elf lady decided to attack Karsten and tried to bite him. Yeah. Yeah.

I'd forgotten, Chris, and I'm not sure how to make it happen. I'm supposed to do that, magic thingy. Well Oh, yeah. Just roll a, roll a e four, and then if you've got a one or two, that's a first level spell. And if you've got a two or three, that's a second level spell or second rank spell.

Okay. So you gain one second rank spell. So I'm just you you can basically just go to your spells and where it's got a one, like, next to blazing bolt, you just make it a two. Yeah. You're good?

Yeah. Okay. That seems to have done it. Alright. Splendid.

The blazing bolt. I can't even I don't even remember the name of that. Yeah. Alright. Go ahead and blazing bolt that that that lady here.

We need her out of the way so that we can get to Cahir. Oh, you just just as a point of order, just so you know, attacks of opportunity are very rare in this game. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. So she might not have one. Mhmm. I'm not saying does. I'm not saying that she doesn't.

As a matter of fact, I don't even know. Like, I have to go and check out her character sheet. Right. Right. But most monsters don't have attack of opportunity.

So I laugh and then who does. Right? Well, anyway, regardless, I I'm gonna I'm gonna try this on her. I think, her chosen. I'll do this.

I'll do this. Please do decent. Yeah. It's decent. Seems decent.

That's a hit. Yay. See, Jason, you can roll good. I know. Let's see the first.

Ouch. Good one. $16.01 offset each other quite nicely. 16. That's not bad.

Or 19. No. 19. Oh, that's pretty that's that's pretty good for this this old dude. That's pretty good.

Alright. So that was all three of my moves. K. So you did a three action blazing bolt? Yeah.

Blazing bolted her in the face? Alright. Yeah. Wait. Knock her teeth out.

Well No. Feeling good, but that's she's pretty strong. I work. You're not feeling you're not feeling good. She's not feeling good either.

Given the circumstances, just looking at these people, I I assume I'm able to tell. Do these look similar to the well preserved corpses we saw earlier? They do. Yeah. I kinda thought so.

In fact. Yeah. Alright. So they were tall. Not gonna be successful for that.

So alright. We're gonna start off just to do the do the thing. Boop boop. Yay. Oh, that's pretty good.

That is sounds great. So that will be a long lasting greatest anthem. Everybody grab your anthem. Yay. Where did I stick it?

Just drag it over you. Drop it off your, your your pog. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

I'll tell you where to stick it. But I knew that was coming when I shut up. We're just gonna do the old standard, an electric arc, the chick in front of me and that funky looking chest that just came alive. Okay. Because, all we've got is second level spells left, and neither one of them are gonna be really effective right now.

So, oh, that's not good damage. Look at that. Three ones and a two. Boo. Oh, well, maybe it's enough.

He's, not feeling good. So Maybe. Give me one second. Yeah. Yeah.

Because I'm not the greatest anthem yeah. Go ahead, Remy. Yeah. On the on the spell at the bottom, there's it says spell effect, greatest anthem. Just where it says spell effect, greatest anthem, just click and drag that over to your character, thing.

Okay. So I can't do it for you, kinda. I don't think I can. No. I got it.

Okay. Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool.

Nope. I cannot. In fact, I did not think so. Alright. So both of the both of them get Okay.

Get hit with, the electric arc spark Nice. The the spark bounces between the two of them, and they get stiff really quickly, but then get back but then drop back into their regular combat activities. Oh, well. We tried. They felt it.

They felt it. Alright. This will be interesting. You're gonna be dead. No.

That's what I'm thinking. Don't think like that. Oh, Oh, nobody really nobody really ran up to help you. So Nope. It's it's got a right way.

That's all. Just get away. Well, the two squishies went, Yeah. Carson's up soon. He can come up there and help.

Fair enough. Do it. In the meantime Uh-huh. There's only one target. Yeah.

Yeah. Now, Chris, you seem to be rolling feeling so good. A lot of privately rolled dice. I don't remember you doing that before. Fine.

I'll go I'll go normal. Sorry about that. The new thing. The new, Oh, is that it? Okay.

I just remember I just remember being able to see when you got hit. Really? Yep. So Under strike? Yeah.

A long ways with that one. Yep. Get them all. So she releases a, a tendril of lightning that cracks with with thunder dealing damage to you. Here, please make a reflex save.

Big money. Oh. It's not big money. That may that may be a good time for a hero point. Yeah.

I would say that's tough. Yeah. Let's do that. We have two of them now because we've been playing for a while. Right?

Why not? We should. Oh, rolled to the 17 part, you lazy bum. Any of the other sides right there would have been great. Or Alright.

So you did succeed. Hoping to make that crit. But I know. Right? Critical success would have been fantastic.

Oh, that's maybe what I should've done instead. You would have been very nice indeed. I think cussive on the back end of that spells or something. And you are clumsy one for a round. You're always clumsy one.

Alright. So you take seven points of electric, you take seven points of damage. Six of that is from electricity and the other one is just a sonic boom that hits your ears. And then she's going to cast, field. Oh.

That was anticlimactic. I was hoping for better. I'd go with what we got. Okay. Carson, you're up.

I'm up. I'm gonna whack the girl right there by me. Okay. Boom. Chaka locka.

Winter night. And there's a storm. Come on, baby. Wow. Come on.

Mhmm. I'm like, yes. Did you roll the critical one? Yeah. I got a three.

That was still killer. Which was enough. K. And then I'm I can't even oh, I can too. I'm gonna run to Carson.

Oh, to here. I'm gonna heal him for twelve. Wait. Maybe. I can there we go, red team.

Yeah. Alright. Take it. Nice. There's an apply healing button.

Also, something also something that you should that you should do as well is go up to the lay on hands healing thing and pull over the spell effect lay on hands. Me? Oh. Yes. K.

Here. You get a plus two status bonus to your AC for a round when you're, when lay on hands is applied to you in combat. Oh, look at that. Where do I pull it? You're pulled onto your.

Oh, I know. I just can't grab anything. So where that person, that pink or orange person is spell effects. Yeah. Lay on hand.

Just grab that. Oh, there I can grab. Okay. Yeah. It doesn't it doesn't immediately look like you could grab that like it's a button or anything.

So that's what took me so long to figure out the other thing. Okay. Okay. I got it. Alright.

Cool. Sweet. Well, you may survive another round. I may. Speaking of, Kahir, you are up.

So, Chris, I'm kinda wondering. Mhmm. I have this item that support potion of fire retaliation. Uh-huh. And since this thing is wood, you know, if I should put that on or do whatever before I hit him?

Well, that'd be kinda funny. Well, that is definitely something that you could do. Or should I just tighten swing and try to get it over with? That that is a really that's a really hard call, honestly. Like, I I would say, go with go with your gut on that one.

Because that that is a that is a hard that is a hard call. I'll tighten swing. Try that for the first action. Right. Just give me one second, because right now you are grabbed.

I think oh, he grabbed me that third action. Right? I like got a tentacle on me or something. I didn't grapple you, but he still got you somehow. Yeah.

Structuring up. Yeah. So you are you are grabbed at the moment, that, so if you wanna try and get out of that, you have to do a you have to do a reflex save in order to be able to get out of it, or you can just try and keep going even though you grabbed. So What does the grab do? Well chances of hitting?

It makes you off guard and immobilize. So you can't move and you, and your AC is too less than what it was before. I gave you a plus two. So Let's just try. It's gonna always retry.

Oh, I see. Right? That does it. Now when I'm tight in swinging, it should roll more dice. Right?

Yep. Two dice. Okay. Nice. Right.

Nice. You do 27 points of damage to it. It takes it. Oh, that's tough. But it looks Looks what?

It looks looks really hungry. I mean, it looks hungry. It has not even remotely con gotten it it ain't it ain't scared. It's not disinterested. You cannot move because you are immobilized.

So best cat. Because you are grabbed. So you can try and use your action to Critical hit is what we're gonna try. Okay. You can't do me the ring with this one.

No. Wow. Oh my gosh. Holy cow. Should've let him go.

Do not try to hold down my fury. Wow. I'm trying to let this happen here. Just wanted to walk away. I wanted to give him a chance to hit Carson.

Oh my gosh. Wow. Amazing. Oh. Oh, wow.

Wonderful. Just and 72 points of damage. Judas Priest. Holy shit. Oh, so only the barbarian only the barbarian could do that.

Oh, yeah. There was Oh, that's hilarious. Like, how like, Scott, who needed to do that much damage in order to drop the thing? Yeah. That's what I was gathering.

That's amazing. Oh my gosh. That's crazy funny. Second rule That was supposed to be a really tough monster. Shoot.

Okay. It was. It was. Apparently, it was. It took half of it, it looked like.

Sameer, you're up. Okay. There's no more trailers, is there? Yeah. They're still still monster.

We used to try them. Sorry. That was, very distracting there. That was a very distracting performance. Should get, like, six hero points for that?

Oh, man. That's so good. I'm going to I'm gonna target this guy here, Mhmm. And I'm going to I'm gonna do that. Right?

Is that the is that the way you do it? Well, and, Scott, it it didn't specifically matter for this for this one because you rolled in at 20. But, when you use Titan Swing, it counts as two attacks. So your third attack would have been a negative 10, non negative five. So Oh, sorry.

Just keep that in mind. Oh, it's it's it's no it is no problem. You still you still credit the guy because you it because you rolled in at twenty. So it it does not affect what happened here at all. But just wanted to make sure that you are aware of that.

So it's like two swings? Exactly. Yeah. Okay. I will remember.

Interesting. I guess I don't have a great idea here what to do. Let's let's just do let's just do the teleconnect projectile. You're gonna extend that? I thought I did.

Okay. Yeah. I think I did. It's showing up. Yeah.

You got me still on there. So I'm gonna do here. Attack. Slack. It's a nice hit.

Oh, look at that. Alright. I'm not used to this. What do I do now? Well, it's all around.

Shoot. You what? Next to the goal damage is critical damage? Not on not on the spells. So Oh, there's not?

Just oh, awesome. So just roll damage, and then I'm just going to apply double damage to the creature because that's what you do anyway. That's a nice roll. It is. That's 31 points of damage.

Nice job. But 32 points of damage. Holy cow. One shot at a person. Oh, nice.

Nice. Wow. It's first. One spell gaster to another. Of course.

Right? Oh, many crypts. It's crazy. Absurd. Oh my gosh.

Sorry, Chris. That's okay. This was this was supposed to be a this this was supposed to be a rough battle. It was. I mean, I nearly dropped you in one round.

Yeah. I am. Yeah. You did. Right.

Right. Right. What the hell was that thing? Yeah. Right.

Did you guys see the clock chewing my face off? Where were you guys? Does it stood at your treasure chest? It it basically has a treasure room, Luke. So so after, after after the, the mimic kind of falls over in its death throes, its giant mod just kind of opens up, and treasure and loot falls out of it.

Interesting. That is interesting. Never seen that before. Oh, and this may be a different this is a different style of loot than than what I've been showing you guys before. I wanted to try it out and see see what what we Yeah.

Yeah. What we thought. So, you can basically when you open it up, you can see the, like, from which creature it's from, how many, you know, how many you've got and that different things going on there. So Interesting. Health of good health is interesting.

The person with 36 HP where everybody else has Right. Right. No. It's it's interesting how it works. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Take it. You know, legit, I don't know that it's really I think it would serve you guys better.

The what? It's only four HP. Yeah. I I you know, well, I guess that's true. Immediately It's only four HP.

Yeah. The the impact to you is significantly higher than anybody else in the group. By ratio. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

I don't like that. Taking these, s Button. What did that do? Spicy cinnamon. No.

That's neat. That seems like something I want. Maybe. There's a take button. Oh, yeah.

I saw the the take button. Our wants to take an item. Our does want to take an item. Accept. There you go.

Accept. Here we go. I think we should take it all. Those other three stuff. So I think we're starting to run out of room for the crappy stuff.

But, yeah, like, these alchemical things we should probably take. The paste and stuff? I think I'm gonna take the spy. I think I am the sneakiest of us if we need to use that somewhere. I mean, that probably should take the pace because I touch people.

Looks like you put it on your skin. Yeah. So it's like if one of us gets sickened, the pace can help us get rid of it. Like, when you get sickened, you have to use an action to throw it up, and the pace makes it easier to do that. So yeah.

Sure. What does this refilling mist do? Oh, I'm saying fast. For invisible people. You do.

Oh, yeah. Invisible creatures become fast too. Been sealed. I guess I'll my thought is I can take the mist just because my actions, like, I'm kind of designing myself to be more support. Now the downside is I'm not in melee very often.

So I don't know. Maybe one of the ballet guys would actually be better with it because they're gonna be closer. Yeah. This quantity Okay. Deal.

Then I'm going to and you also find 70 gold in there, so I'm going to just read that. I knew that was the treasure chest. Yeah. That's our stuff. You just had to split open the treasure chest.

That's all you had to do, and it almost killed me. It did. Oh, okay. And then I'm gonna go to bed. Yeah.

So at this point, I think that we are in a good spot to good spot to call it, and we'll pick up where we left off, next time. Weeks. K. Two weeks Tuesday. Is that the goal?

Seems to be the the appropriate time for that or the time that works out best for everybody at this point. Or twenty eight. Alright. Twenty eight at seven.
