# Transcript
Okay, so who remembers
Where we
Did up
Who remembers what happened last time
We were in a battle with a bunch of
A bunch of goblins
Jason killed something
Running away
I didn't kill it
We captured it
We did? Oh, because we want to figure out where we're going
I want to interrogate
Or have somebody who's really good at interrogating
To interrogate
Yes
That's what I remember
You guys were chasing down
The hag known as Velcra
Who is apparently leading the
Firewalker tribe
Of goblins
In your
In your tracking
You tracked them
You tracked
The group to
This part of the bog
That is
That the trees grow
Their leaves
In a reddish hue
Rather than a green hue
And the overall mist
Of the area
Is
More of a
Pink
Pinkish
Color
As you were moving more and more
Towards this area
You also
Knew that
The giant frog monster
That you have been avoiding
Rightfully so
Because it looks like
It'll be really
Really
Really difficult
If not impossible
For you to defeat
At your current
Skill level
That creature
Exists
In this area
But you did find
That there were
A number of clues
That were pointing you
Towards this area
To find
Toadwin
The
Heir to the
Namarzul
Or the frog people
Tribe
You suspect that
Valkra
Was
Using his
Blood
To create
A
A key
Of some kind
Trying to remember
If you guys
Actually
Got a proper
Name
For the key
But
I
I don't
I don't remember
If I told you
But
It is
The
Ember key
I believe
So
You guys
Tracked them
In this
Direction
And were
Ambushed
By a
Group
Of
Goblins
Firewalker
Goblins
As well
As
Some
Undead
Creatures
And
At least
One of them
Was a
Namarzul
White
So
You defeated
All of them
With the
Exception of
One goblin
That tried to
Run away
But
Amir was
Able to
Knock it out
Before it was
Able to get
Too far away
With a number
Of different
Clever
Shenanigans
To
Get him
Just far
Enough
To be able
To shoot
Be able to
Get him
And
This is
Where we
Are
All right
So
Here we
Are guys
Yeah
So
The
The
The
Namar
The
Not Namar
The Firewalker
Goblin
Has just
Been knocked
Out
You guys
You guys
Are
You know
Taking
Your
You guys
Are
You know
Catching
Your breath
From the
Battle
It was a
Pretty intense
Battle
But you
Were all
Able to
Make it
Out
Alive
And in
Relatively
Good
Shape
What are
You going
To be
Doing
Now
So
I was
Chasing
That guy
Down
I'm going
To continue
To close
The distance
Until I
Am
You know
At him
And can
Appropriately
Apprehend
And or
Maybe
Bind
Him
For sure
I think
We were
Following
Jason
Weren't we
In all
Those turns
Or no
Yeah
You guys
Were moving
Pretty much
As a group
So
You can
Definitely
Move
Move
More
Towards
Where the
Where the
One living
Goblin
Is
And
Samir
You were
It's
It's
Simple enough
For you
To be
Able
To
Bind
The
Bind
The
And
Make sure
That it's
Not going
To get
Away
Anytime
Soon
Perfect
Done
Alright
Where are
Your next
I
Gotta do
Some
Healing

You need
To do
Some
Healing

Of
Stuff
If
That's
What
You're
Wanting

I
Don't

How
To
Do
It
When
He's
When
I
Don't

What
Um

Oh
Oh
Oh
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Okay
Um
Yeah
You can't
You can't

Somebody
Because
There's
Nobody

Thing
So
Um
Let me
Just
Go ahead
And
We'll
Switch
You guys
Back
Over
To
The
Combat
Um
The
Combat
Map
So
That
Clark
You can
Do
What
You
Do
What
You
Gotta
Do
That
Should
Make
It
A
Little
Bit
Easier
On
You
Sorry
About
That
I
Was
Confused
I
Was
Like
I
Don't
Know
What
You
Mean
So
So
At
This
Point
We're
All
With
The
Goblin
Over
There
Who's
Snoozing
Yeah
I'll
Just
Move
Everybody
Over
There
Hmm
That's
A
Neat
Trick
Okay
Okay
Person
Uh
I
Need
To
Make
You
Really
Small
Okay
Uh
There
Instruidore is struggling to get there but he I have confidence he'll make it
A lot of walls
Hmm
Yay
Hey
Guys
Hey
You made it
Yay
It's the Ramsey
Oh
What up
I
Completely
Forgot
And it wasn't on my calendar so
Oh
Dinner
And I checked my phone and I'm like oh
Oh shit
All right
Let me
Let me get on
Okay
No worries
Oh
I've done nothing
Are you okay
Um
Now
Um
Scott
Barely
Her
Uh
I could use 12 more if you got them
Hmm
Oh
Wow
That would take me from zero to full hip
What
82 hit points
I'm just kidding
That's a mild exaggeration
There you go
Okay
82 hit points
Huh
Wow
Alwar still got me beat by 10 hit points
You really expect to be able to catch up
To
Well
Alwar is a
Is a spellcaster
But he's
A bard
And
How do I click on myself
You're a sorcerer
Uh
When you
When you
When you hover over your character
If you press the T button
That'll target you
The D button
T
T
T for target
T
Yep
Oh
E for target
I wanted to do a right or left click
Oh
I don't know
It works
It works for everybody else
Unfortunately for yourself
You have to use the T
You have to use the T
T button
Mmhmm
How is it that Prince Troubadour
Has got
54 hit points
All right
I'm good
Um
I have
I have
I have
Um
I have done it
It's
Three times
Dude
In bad shape
Holy cow
I can
Does anyone else need healing
Proubadour
No he
He got himself
The champion
Oh did he
Okay
Uh
Yeah
His hit points are really low
I mean
He's barely above me
Um
And he's got a plus two constitution
I'm amazed
I don't know what to tell you man
He's a champion
So he should have
Decent amount of hit points
Yeah
Oh yeah
I know why
Cause you guys are demigods
You get an extra three hit points
Every single
Um
Every
Level
Um
Every level
Mmhmm
That's why
You're
That's why your hit points
Are
So much
That
That's why
Prince Troubadour's hit points
Are so low
He's just a normal character
Mmhmm
Just a dude
I suck
Right
I mean you could look at it like that
Or you could look at it like
He's hanging out with the
He's hanging out with the
With the popular kids at school
So
You know
He becomes more awesome by
Association
By association
Exactly
Alright
So
You have the
Uh
You have the goblin
Side up
And
You know
It's not quite coming to
Just yet
But
Um
It'll be able to come to
At
At any point
Is there anything else
That you guys want to do
After having
Performed
Healing
Activities
Um
He said
One of these
Creatures was
A white
Yes
Okay
I'm not sure
That I really know
What that is
Um
Oh
You
Would know
That what that is
Because you guys
Have fought whites
In the past
Um
And
The white
And the white
Is the undead creature
That had killed
All of Prince Troubadour's
Um
Uh
Uh
Some patriots
Uh
The
The band that he was
Traveling with before
And as a matter of fact
That Tripkey white
That um
You guys killed
Was actually
One of his
Um
Um
Or comrades
Uh
Yeah
One of his allies
That was
Killed by a white
So
Um
That
That much
You do
You know
Thank you
For the repressure
Yeah
No problem
A bit sad
Alright
Um
I'm assuming
You guys
Are gonna want to
Rifle through the bodies
Uh huh
Uh huh
You guys
I'm all stacked up
Over here
In a nice corner
Um
Okay
So
Make it easier
Yeah
So
I will go ahead
And drop
These spoils
That you were able
To find
Here in the chat
Let's give me
Give me
Uh
Ooh
Yep
Boots of elvenkind
Boots of elvenkind
Boots of elvenkind
Hello
Hello
Hello
Everyone
Everyone's just been so quiet
Everybody's waiting
In anxious anticipation
For all the goodies
I'm about to drop on you
Yay
Waiting for the flat loop
Boots of elvenkind
Recording rod
Yeah
Gadget skates
Potion of leaping
Fult scroll
Case of
Simplicity
What does all that mean
In english
Oh
Uh
Well if you click on them
They'll give you
You
You will see
Descriptions pop
Populate
In english
Yeah
It's crazy
Now obviously
You
Do have to choose
Who is going to have
What
But
Not everybody gets
Not one
Per person
I'm going to make that
Clear
Before we get
Absolute weird
Hmm
And
Rather than
I'm going to
Generate
The
Role that
Or the
Occult
The occult
Role
That
Um
Automatically
Comes inside
That case
For you here
Okay
Okay
I would like
The gadget
Skates
Unless someone else
Wants them
That
Sounds
Fantastic
All you
All you
Man
Let's
Say
Our
Guys
Having more
Movement
Seems good
Right
I can already
Move 35 feet
What are you
25
I'm at
25
That would make
Sense for me
You guys can have
All the rest
Don't really need
Anything
Chris
How do I
Get that
From there
Into my
Character
You just
You flick and drag
It onto your
Character sheet
Or click and drag
It onto your
Character pog
That should get
You there
All right
And Ramsey
The
Um
I
I mean
I'm just
Assuming that
You're the one
Picking up the
Occult scroll
Uh
Case
I would
Imagine
I think I'm
The only one
You're the only
One that
Using it
Yeah
The only one
That can use
It
Um
So
The scroll
That
There's a scroll
That's already
In that case
Which is
A
Scroll of
Curse of
Recoil
So
Okay
You're lost
Okay
I see
I see
Interesting
Um
Jason you can
Have everything
Out
The elven boots
Are good
I'll take
Those
But
Elven boots
Are good
For anyone
I don't know
Why everybody
Isn't jumping
On that
I'm happy
To take
Them
Yeah
Um
You can have
The elven boots
You don't
Want to move
Five
You don't want
To move
Five feet
More
Every round
Clark
I think that's
Only
If you have
The
Oak of
Elvenkind
Also
Yeah
Yeah
And
It's not
Here
Yeah
It's a
Plus one
To acrobatics
Check
Until the end
Of your turn
You can ignore
Difficult train
We're missing
The cloak
Now
Once per hour
Until the end
Of your turn
You can ignore
Difficult train
When moving
On the ground
If you're
Wearing
The cloak
Of
Elven
Okay
You gain the
Five
Bonus
Okay
Well
I guess it's
Not as often
As I thought
It was
But
Ignoring the
Difficult train
It's still
It's
Yeah
It's still
Baller
Being able to
Get through
Difficult train
And people
That want to
Move from
One location
To another
Really fast
I would
Recommend the
Boots be
On their
Feet
Rather than
A spell
Caster
Who's not
Going to
Move at
All
Awful
Just
Just
Recommendation
Like
Okay
Okay
Okay
Okay
So I
Should take
Off
Well I
Yeah I
Mean like
Basically
What it does
Is it allows
You to
Ignore
Difficult
Train
So if
There's
An oil
Slick
Or something
That's in
Between you
And your
Opponent
Then you
Can just
Ignore it
Makes it
So that
And what
Difficult
Train does
Is it
Makes you
It makes
Every
Movement
Cost double
When you're
Moving through
Difficult
Train
So
So the
Boots of
Elvenkind
Like I said
I mean
They're
They're useful
For anyone
I mean
Obviously
If
If
You know
Samir
He needs
To get
GTFO
And he
Doesn't
And he
Wants to
And he
Wants to
Be able to
Get out
Really quickly
And there's
A bunch of
Difficult
Train around
Him
Then he's
Gonna have
A hard
Time
So it's
Still useful
On a
Spellcaster
It's just
More useful
On like a
Melee
Combatant or
Somebody who's
Gonna be
Moving a
Lot
Just because
You get to
Ignore
Difficult
Train
Did you
Already
I did
Not
I took
The
Recording
Rod
That was
Useful
Very
Useful
In the
Dwarf
Campaign
It
Was
Yeah
And you
Get another
Shot at
It
So
Record
Some
Stuff
All right
Let's
Interrogate
This
Mother
Or is
He
Dead
I'm
Gonna
Grab
That
Motion
Leaping
Who
Ended
Up
Getting
The
Gadget
Skates
Clark
Okay
Me
Cool
Cool
Cool
Okay
Do we
Have
Anything
Left
Got
The
Boots
Of
Ovenkind
Recording
Rod
Is
Taken
Gadget
Skates
Are
Taken
Leaping
Is
Taken
The
Colt
Scroll
Is
Taken
The
Colt
Scroll
Case
And
Everybody
Has
Increased
Their
Their
Monies
By
Um
50
Gold
Nope
I
Did
Not
Do
That
You
Should
Take
Your
Money
Where
Is
My
I
Really
Needed
To
Buy
The
Gold
I
Well
You
You've
Just
Never
Chosen
To
Go
Shopping
Had
Coins
Oh
There
We
Go
I
Was
Like
How
Does
This
Happen
Yeah
Where
Wherever
It
Is
Like
I
At
The
Bottom
Of
The
At
The
Bottom
Of
The
Chat
Window
That
Had
All
Of
The
Stuff
In
It
I
Had
A
200
GP
So
Everybody
Oh
I
Didn't
Know
What
That
Was
I
Looked
At
It
Or
50
Gold
Pieces
Not
500
Yeah
I'm
Rich
Magic
Swords
In
This
Or
No
Like
Plus
Five
So
You
Automatically
You
Automatically
Get
The
Pluses
But
There
Are
Property
Runes
That
You
Can
Add
To
Your
Weapons
To
Make
Them
Like
Like
The
Fire
Like
The
Plus
Two
Fire
Damage
Or
The
Plus
Or
Plus
Plus
Two
D6
Fire
Damage
Or
You
Know
That
Kind
Of
Stuff
You
I
Don't
It's
Not
Just
A
General
Plus
Five
To
Hit
Plus
Five
Damage
Well
The
System
Does
That
But
I
But
I
I'm
The
Way
That
I'm
Running
It
It
Just
Automatically
Gets
Added
So
Here
So you
Don't
Have to
Pay
For
It
You
Get
The
Pluses
Like
Right
Now
You're
Running
Around
With
Right
Now
You're
Running
Around
With
A
Plus
One
Striking
Sword
And
A
Plus
One
Striking
Shield
I
I
See
So
You're
All
Right
Getting
Your
Pluses
For
That
But
If
You
Want
To
Add
Like
Firebrand
Or
Frost
Damage
Or
Lightning
Damage
And
That
Kind
Of
Stuff
You
Can
You
Can
Buy
Runes
To
Upgrade
Those
That
Way
What
If
I
Want
To
Go
To
A
Plus
Two
You
Just
Need
To
Level
I
See
It's
Not
You
Don't
Buy
It
You
Don't
Buy
That
Particular
Thing
It
Just
As
Part
Of
Your
Character
Yeah
I'm
I'm
Using
A
House
Rule
That
Just
Automatically
Or
It's
It's
It's
A
House
Rule
But
It's
A
Recommended
House
Rule
I
Forget
What
They're
Exactly
Called
But
You
Are
Automatically
Going
To
Get
Your
Pluses
To
Attack
And
Damage
As
You
Level
So
We
Don't
So
We
Don't
Have
To
Like
Worry
About
Like
You
Being
You
Staying
Current
The
Math
In
This
Game
Is
So
Tight
That
If
You're
At
A
Certain
Level
And
You
Don't
Have
A
Certain
Plus
On
Your
Weapon
You're
Not
Going to
Hit
As
Often
As
Expected
That
Makes
Sense
And
Then
Does
That
Bonus
Apply
To
All
Weapons
As
Long
As
I'm
Proficient
In
Them
Yeah
Yeah
Which is
Another benefit
Of
The
House
Rule
Because
Otherwise
You would
Have to
Be
Buying
For
The
You'd
Have to
Be
Buying
The
Pluses
For
All
Your
Weapons
If
You
Had
Multiple
Weapons
So
Yeah
That
Totally
Makes
Sense
Okay
I
Really
Appreciate
That
House
Rule
A lot
Then
I
Don't
Have
To
I
Mean
I
Can
Do
The
Runes
But
I
Don't
Have
To
Keep
Buying
Different
Swords
I
Like
My
Swords
Thank
You
Yeah
And
You
Can
Get
Those
Runes
On
There
And
Add
Make
Them
All
Kinds
Of
All
Kinds
Of
Cool
And
You
Can
Do
Same
Thing
With
Your
Shield
And
That
Kind
Of
Stuff
So
You're
Still
Going
To
Be
Wanting
To
Buy
Weapon
Runes
It's
Just
Not
The
Plus
One
Stuff
Because
That's
Already
Taken
Care
Of
You
Can
Only
Have
The
Same
Amount
Of
Property
Runes
On
Your
Weapons
As
You
Have
The
Pluses
On
There
So
If
You've
Got
Plus
One
Weapon
You
Only
Have
One
Property
Rune
Okay
Plus
Two
You
Can
Have
Two
If
You
Have
Plus
Three
You
Can
Have
Three
You
Know
And
How
How
Far
Does
That
Go
Up
Um
Good
Question
I
Want to
Say
Three
I
Think
Three
Yeah
So
So
You
Should
Be
Popping
Up
To
A
Plus
Two
Here
At
Level
Five
Or
Six
I
Think
And
Then
You'll
Pop
Up
To
Plus
Three
At
Level
Ten
And
Then
From
There
You're
Not
Going
To
Get
Another
Plus
So
All
Right
Any
More
Questions
Before
We
Lay
Into
The
Goblin
Right
Let
Let's
Let's
Let's
Go
Go ahead
And
Start
The
Interrogation
If
That's
That's
What you
Guys
Are
Wanting
To
Do
Next
Right
Okay
So
After
After
After
A
Few
Minutes
Or
After
A
Bit
Which
You
Guys
Get
All
Situated
You
Get
Through
All
Your
Stuff
You
Take
Care
Of
The
Bodies
Or
Whatever
It
Is
That
You
Do
Whether
It's
Religious
Rites
Or
What
Have
You
You
Notice
That
The
Goblin
That
You
Had
Knocked
Out
Is
Lying
On
Its
Side
Its
Eyes
Are
Open
And
You
See
These
Fiery
Embers
In
Its
Eye
Socket
And
It's
Looking
Right
At
You
What
Do
You
Do
It's
Still
Hogtied
So
Mmm
Mmm
Ah
Ugly
Little
Beast
Yeah
Yeah
And
If
You
Do
Want
To
See
What
It
Looks
Like
It
Is
In
The
NPC
Pane
Of
The
Of
The
Thing
There
So
Anyway
Oh
You woke
Up
Huh
Good
Get him
In
A
Nice
Sitting
Position
All
Right
You
You
Are
Roughly
Or
Gently
Do
You
Not
Particularly
Either
Okay
So
You
You
Set
Him
Up
On
His
On
His
Knees
And
He's
You
Know
Kind
Of
Sitting
There
With
His
Arms
Tied
Are
Are
His
Arms
In
Front
Of
Him
Or
Are
They
Behind
Him
I
Was
Finding
Everything
Kind of
Tied
Up
Behind
Him
Okay
So
He's
You know
So
You've
Got him
On
His
Knees
His
Hands
Are
Tied
Up
Behind
Him
His
Feet
Are
Tied
Together
As
Well
And
He's
Again
He's
Just
Kind
Looking
At
You
The
The
Face
That
He
Has
Is
Pretty
Unnerving
I
Mean
Goblins
Are
Kind of
Unnerving
To
Be
In
With
But
Just
Kind
Of
The
Way
That
The
Way
That
These
Firewalker
Goblins
Look
Is
Really
Really
Unnerving
Their
Their
Skin
The
Way
It's
Cracked
The
Way
It
Looks
Like
Scorched
Earth
With
Glowing
Red
Embers
Underneath
It
Combined
With
Those
Glowing
Red
Eyes
Like
The
Flame
Touched
Eyes
Is
Just
A
Really
Unnerving
Sort
Of
Appearance
When
You
Actually
Look
At
It
He's
Definitely
Not
Providing
Any
He's
Not
Going
To
Start
The
Conversation
So
He's
Just
Sitting
There
Staring
At
You
We
Should
Start
With
Some
Introductions
I'll
Proceed
With
Samir
Would
Would
You guys
Prefer
Or
Not
Prefer
To
Give the
Gentlemen
Your
Names
I'm
I'm
Not
Going
To
Tell
Him
My
Name
Get
With
It
Why
You
Stalling
Let's
Move
This
Along
Oh
My
Gosh
You
Clearly
Never
Done
An
Interrogation
Oh
My
Gosh
Not
Gonna
Give
Him
A
Cigarette
Let's
Go
That's
Right
You're
Not
Oh
So I'm
Being
I'm
Okay
I was
Trying to
Be
Cordial
And
Polite
Nice
My
Comrades
Are
Less
Interested
In
The
Game
So
No
We
Are
Interested
In
The
Game
He
Doesn't
Care
Because
His
Eyes
Are
Red
He
Hates
I
Don't
Think
That's
Hate
Behind
Those
I
Think
You
Should
Chop
Off
A
Lim
And
I
Think
You
Might
Talk
A
Little
Bit
More
Oh
Yeah
Is
He
Understanding
All
Of
This
And
So
Carsten
Revealed
His
Racism
To
The
The
Entire
Group
I
Don't
Think
That
You're
Racist
Against
Goblins
I
Just
Think
You're
Racist
Against
Glowing
Eyed
Goblins
You
Don't
You
Don't
Red
Eyes
Sorry
Little
Facetious
Who's
Got
The
Elven
Boots
On
I'm
Joking
I'm
Joking
All
Right
So
Here
Definitely
Well
Who's
Paying
Attention
To
The
Goblin
While
You
Guys
Are
Having
This
Conversation
Um
Because
Depending
It's
Um
He's
Not
Specifically
Hiding
His
Emotions
But
He's
Also
Like
A
Little
Bit
Of
An
Alien
Entity
To
You
So
Um
Somebody
Who
Has
A
Decent
Society
Or
Some
Sort
Of
Charisma
Based
Um
Skill
You
Um
You
I
Got
Nothing
A
Person
Um
What
Would
That
Be
Do
Do
Do
Not
Have
Society
I'm
A
Part
Two
Society
Yeah
So I
Think
That
Like
The
Um
Really
Call it
A D&D
Uh
Diplomacy
That
Thing
Insight
Just falls
Into
Perception
Okay
Here
Uh
Okay
I was
Hoping
For a
Charisma
Which is
A little
Weird
But
Yeah
No
Charisma
Based
Things
Are
Active
Diplomacy
Deception
Intimidate
Okay
So this
Is what
Uh
This is
What I
Will
Do
Um
This
Is
How
I
Will
Um
How
I
Will
Rule
This
If
You
Have
A
Plus
Two
Or
More
In
Charisma
Then
You
Can
Use
Your
Perception
To
Determine
The
Um
To
Determine
The
General
Like
Insight
Um
Like
General
Disposition
Of
The
Goblin
Um
Otherwise
You
Are
Just
Not
As
Familiar
With
The
Social
Interactions
To
Be
Able
To
Do
That
If
You
Are
Trained
In
Society
I
Will
Also
Allow
A
Perception
So
Either
One
Of
Those
Things
Guess
Who's
Trained
In
Charisma
Plus
Two
Yeah
That
I
I
Can
I
I
Want to
Do
A
Perception
Rolling
A
Perception
How do
I roll
It won't
Let
Oh
Yes
I
Rolled
My
Not
One
Oh
My
Gosh
How do
I
Roll
Um
Well
It
Depends
On
Where
You
Are
Are
You
Rolling
Out
Are
You
Trying
To
Go
Out
Of
Your
Character
Sheet
Or
Are
You
Trying
To
Go
Out
Of
The
Hut
In
The
Bottom
No
My
Character
Sheet
Perception
I
Did
Change
The
Color
Of
The
Dice
Yeah
It
Was
A
Flash
You
Two
You
Said
I
Have
To
Have
A
Charisma
Plus
Two
You
Either
Need
To
Have
A
Charisma
Plus
Two
Or
You
Need
To
Be
Trained
In
Society
In
To
Be
Do
That
I
Don't
Think
I'm
Trained
Society
But
I
Think
I
Did
Pretty
Good
There
Yeah
All
Right
So
Both
Our
And
Karsten
You're
You're
Definitely
Picking
Up
Some
General
Vibes
From
This
Goblin
He's
Putting
He's
Definitely
Putting
On
A
Brave
Face
But
He
Is
Also
He
Kind
Of
Like
Noticed
That
His
Eyes
Keep
On
Darting
To
The
Bodies
Of
All
Of
His
Patriots
Like
All
Of
His
Allies
Recently
He
Kind
Of
Nervously
Kind
Of
Resituates
Himself
A
Few
Times
You
Know
Those
Sorts
Of
Things
Through
Those
Physical
Cues
You're
Able
To
Determine
That
He's
Probably
A
Little
Bit
More
Malleable
Than
He
Looks
Right
He's
Putting
On
A
Brave
Face
He's
Not
Specifically
Hiding
It
But
He
Is
Not
Specifically
He's
Not
Actively
Trying
To
Steve
Anyone
But
He's
Also
Not
He's
Also
Trying
To
Be
Brave
So
Fine
Samir
Be
Nice
To
Him
If
You
Need
To
Be
Listen
We're
Asking
Questions
Without
Asking
Questions
Yeah
I know
Only
You
Know
How
To
Do
That
I
Just
I
Would
Just
Prefer
To
Just
Just
Get
Rid
Of
Them
Like
As
Friends
But
No
You
Just
Want
To
Do
The
Right
Thing
First
Question
I
Should
Probably
Ask
Him
A
Question
Yeah
I
Think
You
Should
Ask
Him
A
Question
The
Boots
On
His
Feet
Point
To
Here
Where
And
How
Did
You
Get
Those
Really
Good
Question
Random
Treasure
Table
Gave
Them
No
He
Says
He
Says
They
Were
Given
Us
By
The
Mistress
She
Has
Many
Schools
At
Her
Disposal
They're
Really
Good
Are
You
Writing
This
Down
Carson
No
I'm
Not
Writing
This
Down
You
Want
Me
To
Write
This
Down
I
Don't
Even
Think I
Have
A
Writing
Utensil
In
Any
Of
My
Stash
When
Do
You
Write
Stuff
Down
I'm
Just
You're
The
One
Of
Recording
You
Silly
Willie
Not
Doing
Doing
It's
One
It's
A
One
Shot
Thing
But
You
Can
Record
Over
Though
Can't
You
Don't
Think so
I think
It's
You
You
You
You
Can
Play
It
Replay
It
As
Many
Times
As
You
Want
But
You
But
Once
You
Record
With
It
It's
It's
Done
All right
Let me
Find
Something
Yes
And I
Will
Record
It
Wait
It
Says
It's
Reusable
Maybe
Yeah
This
One's
More
More
Powerful
Yeah
Oh
Yeah
No
That
Yeah
I
Was
Confusing
This
One
With
The
Other
One
Then
Then
We
Can
Use
Zerana
Recording
One
Rod
Okay
Why
Are
You
Recording
This
Conversation
We
Don't
I
Don't
Know
He
Told
Me
To
And
I
Said
I
Don't
Write
It
Down
Yeah
Write
It
Down
Oh
My
Gosh
Okay
Let's
Let's
Continue
So
We
Talked
About
Footwear
Now
Now
Are
You
Going
Through
All
The
Magic
Items
That
We're
Gonna
Have
To
Come
With
Something
On
The
Fly
For
Yeah
That
Would
Be
Funny
No
No
I'm
Not
Going
Through
The
Rest
Of
The
Magic
Artems
Oh
Boo
I'm
Just
Making
Sure
That
I
Don't
Have
To
Boil
My
Blood
At
Him
Specifically
Fair
Enough
I
Mean
If
We
Need
To
The
Elves
Didn't
Sell
It
To
Them
And
They
Didn't
Give
It
To
Them
And
That
That's
A
Bit
Of
An
Offense
On
My
People
Well
Jason
You
Do
Remember
That
In
The
Cave
There
Were
Dark
Elves
In
There
Mm
Mm
So
They
Could
Have
Given
Him
That
Or
Her
Or
Something
Because
They're
Not
Very
Nice
Right
Correct
Maybe
Doesn't
Say
These
Aren't
Boots
Of
All
Of
The
Good
Elves
These
Are
Just
Boots
Of
Elves
So
Yeah
Okay
Okay
Drower
Elves
Too
Buddy
Might
Get
In
A
Fight
About
That
With
Some
Elves
That's
Fair
That's
Fair
Anyway
You're
Yes
I
I
Shoot
You're
Sam
Okay
Um
Yeah
Anyway
Um
But
Samir
Can
Jump
To
Any
Conclusions
He
Wants
To
So
You
Know
If
This
Is
Elven
Make
And
Drow
Don't
Count
As
Elves
Then
Must
Have
Got
It
From
Some
From
Somebody
Else
It's
Uh
Mistress
Is
Uh
Pretty
Popular
Lady
He
You
Protects
Us
From
What
Those
That
Would
Do
Us
Harm
She
Tells
Of
She
Tells
Us
Of
A
Time
Where
We
Are
Where
We
Will
No
Longer
Be
We
Will
No
Longer
Live
In
Fear
Of
Long
Shanks
And
He
Looks
Pointedly
At
You
And
Looks
Pointedly
At
All
The
Corpses
Yeah
Yeah
Justifiably
I
Get
It
But
It
Was
You
Who
Ambushed
Us
It
Was
You
That
Evaded
Our
Territory
Ah
Now
There
We
Go
Now
Now
We
Got
Getting
Some
We
Got
Getting
Some
History
So
We
Are
In
We
Are
In
Our
Rights
To
Defend
Ourselves
Agreed
Mm
Mm
Mm
Mm
Um
This
Is
Where
Jason
Is
Not
Having
The
Clearest
Memory
From
Six
Months
Ago
Uh
This
Specific
Tribe
Tribe
Or
Not
This
Tribe
Of
Goblins
Attacking
The
Frog
Village
Oh
They
Totally
Attacked
The
Frog
Village
They
Also
Totally
Attacked
The
Time
Temple
They
They
They
They
Also
Totally
Invaded
Your
Village
Okay
So
I just
Want to
Make sure
It wasn't
The other
Tribe
Of
Goblins
That we
Were
Dealing
With
Earlier
Nope
Nope
It's
It's
It's
These
Guys
So
His
Logic
While
Sound
In
This
Specific
Example
Is
Not
Sound
In
The
Context
Of
Everything
Else
That's
Going
On
Right
And
So
That's
Where
Yeah
That's
Exactly
Where
We
Go
Next
Guys
I
Bring
Up
These
Specific
Situations
And
Circumstances
So
You
Wouldn't
Have
To
Fear
Us
So
Much
If
You
Weren't
Attacking
Here
Attacking
Here
And
Attacking
Here
Fell
Beyond
What
Is
Recognized
As
Your
Boundaries
And
Your
Borders
Who's
Driving
You
Why
Are
You
Making
These
Attacks
Um
So
He'll
Give
You
He'll
Give
You
A
Story
Um
About
Um
He'll
Basically
Kind
Of
He'll
Give
You
A
Story
About
How
Him
And
His
People
Were
Um
Were
Uh
The
Um
Were
The
Slaves
Of
A
Um
Of
A
Uh
Country
That
Worshipped
The
Sun
How
They
Were
After
The
After
The
The
Great
Cleansing
Fire
Um
Fell
Down
That
They
Were
Found
And
Rescued
By
The
Mistress
How
She
Gave
Um
Gave
Them
Purpose
And
How
Um
She
Showed
Them
That
The
Only
Way
For
Them
To
Truly
Be
Free
Is
To
Is
To
Um
Defeat
Everyone
And
How
She
Promised
That
That
Um
They
Would
If
They
Helped
Her
Um
They
Would
Be
A
Part
Of
The
New
Kingdom
That
Is
Going
To
Be
Built
Once
Time
Itself
Is
Rewritten
So
The
Way
That
He
The
Way
That
He
Words
It
And
The
Way
That
He
Builds
This
Together
Um
He
Basically
Informs
You
That
Um
In
His
Mind
Because
Of
The
Suffering
That
Him
And
His
People
Um
Dealt
With
In
The
Past
The
Ends
Justify
Any
Means
Necessary
And
How
Your
Um
And
How
You
And
Your
People
Have
Been
Solely
Responsible
For
All
Of
His
Suffering
And
All
Of
The
Suffering
Of
His
People
From
The
From
The
Tribe's
Inception
And
How
It's
Justifiable
For
You
To
Be
Sacrificed
For
Him
And
His
People
To
Be
Free
The
Mistress
She's
A
Long
Shanked
Individual
Yes
One
Of
The
Good
Ones
By
The
Name
Of
Velcro
I
Do
Not
Speak
Her
Name
How
Do
You
Know
How
How
Does
Such
A
What
Is
Such
A
Glorious
Um
A
Glorious
Sound
Come
From
Such
Foul
Lips
Possible
That
I'm
More
Glorious
Than
You
Think
What's
Your
Beef
With
The
Yellow
Thing
They
Were
Necessary
We
We
Aren't
Able
To
Produce
As
Many
Soldiers
As
Quickly
As
We
Need
To
So
We
Supplement
It
Gotcha
That
Makes
Sense
Fair
Enough
The
Mistress
This
Isn't
By
Chanks
Hanging
Out
In
Camp
Is
She
She
Stays
Close
Are
See
Here
He
He
Starts
To
Say
Something
But
Then
He
Kind
Of
Checks
Himself
A
Little
Bit
As
If
He
Feels
Like
He
Is
About
To
Give
Up
Too
Much
Information
Jason
I'm
Going
To
Want
Mirror
To
Make
A
Either
A
Diplomacy
Or
An
Intimidation
Check
To
Kind
Of
Help
Facilitate
Is
Help
Loosen
His
Tongue
Can
We
Come
In
And
Help
Do
Some
Of
That
Stuff
You
Can
Absolutely
Assist
Basically
The
Way
That
That
Would
Work
In
This
Context
Is
If
You
Have
An
Idea
About
Something
That
You
Could
Do
That
Would
Help
Prove
Samir's
Point
Or
Just
Kind
Of
Help
Make
Things
More
More
If
Not
Difficult
Well
I
Think
I
Would
See
The
Hesitation
Yep
I
Think
I
Would
See
The
Hesitation
And
Bring
In
The
The
Axe
Scenario
And
Just
Kind
Of
Walk
Up
And
Set
It
Down
Next
To
Him
Pretty
Sure
He
Saw
Me
Kill
Everyone
With
One
Blow
We
Established
That
You
Weren't
Killing
Everyone
With
One
Blow
In
This
In
This
Path
Combat
And
You
Were
Pretty
Sore
About
It
No
His
Compadres
Were
One
Blow
It
Was
The
Big
Dude
That
That
That
Fair
Okay
Yeah
So
You
So
You
Step
Up
And
You
Bring
Your
Imposing
Presence
Along
Go ahead
And
Roll
An
Intimidation
As
Well
Would
That
Whorish
Or
Demoralize
Well
Demoralize
It
Would
Be
Intimidation
But
It
Doesn't
Need
To
Be
Demoralized
Demoralize
Is
More
Of
An
In
Combat
Thing
I
Had
Up
The
Coercion
Thing
Or
Whatever
Uh
Yeah
Coercion
Could
Work
Yeah
You
Want
To
Do
That
I
Just
Roll
The
Intimidation
Get
Off
There
You
Are
All
Right
Who
Is
Pretty
Weak
Pretty
Weak
Oh
That
Is
Pretty
Weak
Or
Big
Buck
Man
As
Yourself
Jason's
More
Intimidated
Than
Me
We
Got
Problems
He's
Got
More
Than
A
Feud
Going
On
Yeah
The
Yeah
He
Starts
Flittering
Across
His
Eyes
Oh
And
He
Bears
A
Couple
Fangs
It
Probably
Does
Look
Rather
Disconcerting
Yes
Yeah
I
Mean
He
Is
Half
Dragon
As
Well
We
Got
A
Little
Bit
Of
Dragon
Blood
In
Him
All
Right
So
He
You
Know
He
Starts
To
Hold
Back
You
Notice
It
Obviously
So
Does
Kahir
Kahir
Steps
Up
Slams
His
Giant
Axe
I
Mean
Keep
Keep
In
Mind
Here
His
Axe
Is
Roughly
Even
Larger
Like
It's
It's
A
Great
Axe
That
Is
That
That
Is
The
That
Is
A
Giant
Axe
So
This
Thing
Is
Just
Gigantic
The
The
Double
Head
Is
Is
As
Broad
As
He
Is
Kind
Of
Thing
And
Samir
You
And
Samir
You
Have
Like
You
You
You
Know
Engage
Your
Draconic
Heritage
To
Bring
A
Little
Bit
Of
Additional
Flair
To
Your
Questions
And
As
He
Tries
To
Hold
Back
You
You
Do
See
That
He
Just
Kind
Of
Starts
Inching
Back
A
Little
Bit
Under
The
Under
The
Intensity
Of
Your
Stare
What
Is
Your
Follow
Up
What's
Your
Follow
Up
Question
Uh
No
No
No
Sorry
I
Think
Jason
He's
Where
Is
She
Staying
Oh
Okay
Um
After
A
Few
Moments
Like
He
He
Looks
At
You
He's
Like
Super
Intimidated
He
Looks
Over
To
The
The
Pile
The
Pile
Of
Bodies
Again
Like
He
Just
Can't
Seem
To
Take
His
Eyes
Away
From
It
He
Looks
At
The
He
Looks
At
The
Um
At
The
Half
Orc
And
And
Also
Kind
Of
Like
The
Shining
Knight
In
The
Back
And
Um
The
Uh
The
Gnome
That
Is
Not
Uh
Not
Terribly
Imposing
But
Is
More
Imposing
Just
By
The
Nature
Of
The
Company
That
He
Keeps
Right
And
Um
He
Uh
He
Just
Kind
Of
Slumps
Down
And
Says
I
Will
Tell
You
But
You
Must
Let
Me
Go
What
Do
You
Mean
Let
You
Go
Do
What
I
Think
It's
Fair
The
Only
Thing
That's
Keeping
Me
Alive
Right
Now
Is
This
Information
I
Must
Have
Your
Word
And
Your
Bond
That
You
Will
Let
Me
Go
If
I
Tell
You
I
Think
It's
A
Fair
Deal
You
Kidding
Me
No
He
Was
His
Life
You
Should
Be
With
Us
For
The
Rest
Of
Your
Life
I
Would
I
Would
Be
Happy
To
Let
Him
Go
I
Think
There
Should
Be
Some
Conditions
On
Where
You
Go
The
Fact of
The
Matter
Is
The
Mistress
Is
Got
You
As
Captive
As
Anybody
Has
Ever
Had
You
If
I
Tell
You
I
Am
Not
Going
To
Go
Back
My
Life
Is
Forefoot
She
Will
Kill
You
My
Life
My
Life
Is
As
Good
As
Dead
Right
Now
The
Only
Chance
I
The
Only
Chance
I
Have
To
Be
Free
Is
To
Leave
And
Never
Return
I
Can't
Tell
You
Or
You
If
I
If
I
Tell
You
If
I
Don't
Tell
You
You
Kill
Me
If
I
Tell
You
Kill
Me
If
I
Tell
You
And
You
Let
Me
Go
And
I
Go
Back
To
Her
They'll
Kill
Me
Yep
I
I
I
I
Ask
I
Ask
This
One
Thing
And
Just
Hope
And
Pray
To
Pray
To
The
Maker
That
You
Win
Because
If
You
Don't
Even
If
I
Run
I
I'm
Already
Dead
I'm
Not
A
God
And
Why
Don't
You
Just
Stay
With
Us
Who's
The
Maker
Because
You
Are
Going
To
Die
At
At
At
At
At
At
At
At
At
At
At
At
At
At
At
At
At
At
At
At
At
At
At
At
Not
Actually
False
Either
Smear
Grins
And
For
Those
Of
You
Who
You
Know
Had
That
Had
Those
Really
Good
Like
Perception
Roles
For
Your
He's
He's
Being
Extremely
Pragmatic
He's
Being
Extremely
Truthful
Here
He is
Not
He is
Not
He
Is
Not
Stupid
He
Is
Not
BSing
You
And
He
Realizes
That
He's
Dead
No
Matter
What
Happens
And
His
Only
Chance
Of
Not
Dying
Is
For
You
Guys
To
Actually
Win
So
He's
Kind
Of
Deciding
Really
Quickly
To
Bet
On
You
Guys
And
Hope
That
You
Don't
Die
But
He
Still
Think
You're
Gonna
Die
Yeah
Yeah
Um
So
Samir
Turns
Around
And
I
Mean
I
I
Do
Poke
The
Question
At
Him
Who
Is
The
Maker
Um
But
To
Confer
With
He
Didn't
Have
An
Answer
For
That
He
He
He's
Got
Some
Just
It
It's
Kind
Of
Like
You
Know
It's
The
The
God
That's
Greater
Than
Greater
Than
The
One
That
They
Currently
Serve
And
Is
Not
Necessarily
The
Not
Necessarily
The
Ally
Of
Their
Deity
In
Bor
Wrath
So
Um
They
Do
Know
That
Bor
Did
Not
Create
The
World
It
Seeks
To
Corrupt
And
Control
It
So
Anyway
Um
My
My
Thought
Here
Would
Be
To
Propose
That
Um
Our
Dear
Little
Friend
Um
I
I
I
Think
The
Best
Refuge
That
I
Can
Suggest
To
Him
Would
Be
If
We
Could
Make
An
Arrangement
Where
He
Would
Um
Maybe
Go
Hang
Out
With
The
Yellow
Fang
I
Think
Of
The
Same
Thing
Sorry
What
Was
That
One
More
Time
I
Don't
I
Don't
Know
That
He
Would
Buy
It
But
That's
His
Call
I
Would
I
Would
Be
Willing
To
Try
And
Negotiate
With
The
Yellow
Thing
Leader
Their
Grim
Fang
To
Have
To
Have
Him
Come
Stay
With
Them
I
Don't
Think
There's
Any
Other
Safe
Place
For
This
Guy
Any
Safer
Place
For
This
Guy
Any
Thoughts
On
That
No I
Agree
I
Was
Thinking
The
Exact
Same
Thing
Okay
So
I'll
Turn
Back
Around
To
Him
Here's
The
Best
That
I
Can
Offer
You
So
Far
As
As
I
Can
See
And
You
Heard
Me
Talking
With
The
Guys
Like
I
Wasn't
Trying
To
Hide
It
From
Him
Tell
Us
What
We
Need
To
Know
I
Cut
Your
Bonds
You
Travel
With
Us
We
Get
You
Back
To
Yellow
Fang
And
Negotiate
Agreement
For
You
To
Stay
With
Them
In
Peace
That's
The
I
Think
That's
The
Safest
Place
That
We
Can
Put
You
Have
Have
One
Problem
With
This
There's
Multiple
Problems
With
This
First
Is
First
Is
I'm
Bartering
This
Information
So
That
I
Can
Get
A
Head
Start
You're
Telling
Me
To
Travel
With
You
And
Die
With
You
I'm
Offering
An
Escort
To
Yellow
I'm
Escorting
You
I
Would
Be
Offering
An
Escort
To
The
Yellow
Fang
Tribe
Like
Okay
So
Just
Help
Chris
Understand
What's
Happening
Here
So
Are
You
Saying
That
You're
Going
To
Drop
What
You're
Doing
Right
Now
And
Take
Him
Back
Across
The
Portal
Into
Where
Into
The
Burned
Wood
Where
The
Yellow
Fang
Tribe
Currently
Lives
And
Drop
Drop
What
You're
Doing
Right
Now
To
Do
That
Or
Are
You
Saying
That
You're
Going
To
Have
Him
Travel
With
You
While
He's
While
He
Directs
You
To
How
Directs
You
On
How
To
Navigate
Around
His
Current
Tribe
And
Then
Once
You've
Defeated
Velcra
Then
You're
Taking
Him
Back
To
The
Yellow
Fang
Tribe
I
Or
Do
You
Have
A
Third
Option
In
Mind
That
I'm
Just
Not
Picking
Up
Right
No
My
The
Question
That
I
Don't
Have
An
Answer
To
That
Samir
Would
Is
How
Far
How
Long
Is
It
To
Get
Him
Back
There
That
Would
Be
That
Would
Be
The
Matter
Of
Minimum
Two
Week
Turnaround
It's
A
Two
Week
One
Week
There
And
One
Week
Back
Right
It's
A
Little
Bit
Long
Yeah
Especially
Considering
That
You
Have
A
Prince
That
May
Be
Being
Killed
In
A
Blood
Ritual
As
You
Speak
Yeah
Okay
Yeah
That's
Not
That's
Not
An
Option
For
Us
To
Do
But
We
Can
Give
Him
Yeah
You
Can
Just
Head
That
Way
Yeah
Run
Up
The
White
Flag
And
You
Know
We
Can
I
Mean
If
You've
Got
Something
That
You
Could
Send
Along
The
Way
To
Kind
Of
Help
Help
Assist
Introduction
Right
You
Know
You
Can
Point
Him
That
Direction
Hope
That
He
Takes
You
Up
On
The
Offer
And
He
Knows
Where
You
Tell
Him
To
But
As
Far
As
Like
Actually
Getting
Him
There
Right
Now
In
The
Current
Timeline
Situation
Not
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
And
He
Is
Not
Wanting
To
Go
Anywhere
Near
The
The
Fire
Walker
Tribe
At
This
Point
Because
He
Knows
That
He's
Dead
So
So
He
Doesn't
Want
To
Make
Himself
An
Easy
Target
Yeah
Sure
I
Mean
Works
For
Me
This
Guy's
No
Threat
To
Us
I
Mean
Unless
You're
Unless
You've
Got
A
Teleport
In
Your
Back
Pocket
There
Mason
I'm
Looking
I
Don't
Know
No
No
I've
Got
Some
Chalk
I
Was
Don't
See
That
I
Have
Much
To
Write
On
The
Chalk's
Not
Good
Well
I'm
Sure
I'm
Sure
That
You
Guys
Can
Figure
Something
Out
As
Far
As
Letter
Of
Introduction
Like
I
Wouldn't
I
Wouldn't
Be
Like
You
Got
Any
Paper
You
Know
I'm
Sure
Between
The
Four
You
You
Got
Some
Way
Of
Being
Able
To
Do
Something
So
I
Like
It
That's
Fair
Deal
I
Think
Carson
Carson
Is
Mute
Okay
Here
Any
Objections
Okay
We're
In
Agreement
We'll
Let
You
Go
And
Send
You
With
The
Best
I
Can
Do
Is
Send
You
With
A
Letter
Um
Introduction
Sealed
Okay
You
Surrender
The
Yellow
Things
If
You
So
Choose
And
I
Think
That's
A
Good
Option
Okay
Um
So
You
Choose
Not
To
That's
Up
To
You
Yeah
So
He
Will
He
Will
Respond
Um
Respond
And
Say
I
Will
Take
Your
Advice
And
Travel
That
Way
And
Uh
After
That
He
Basically
Kind of
Gives
You
He
Gives
You
A
A
The
Lowdown
Of
Of
The
Of
The
Situation
So
Um
As
It
Is
Like
There's
Actually
Like
There's
The
Goblin
War
Camp
That
Is
Pretty
Much
Dead
West
Of
Where
You
Currently
Are
Um
The
Goblin
War
Camp
Holds
Um
Uh
At
Any
One
Time
Anywhere
From
30
Anywhere
From
30
To
50
Goblins
Depending
So
It's
A
Pretty
It's
A
Pretty
Large
Encampment
Especially
For
Um
Like
I
Mean
Communities
After
The
Flaming
Retribution
Have
Tense
Like
Really
Tiny
This
Is
This
Is
More
Medium
More
Of
A
Medium
Size
Sort
Of
Situation
From
From
A
Goblin
War
You
Know
In
General
And
It's
Not
That
There
Are
30
Goblins
It's
There
Are
Always
At
Least
30
To
50
Goblins
There
Are
A
Bunch
Of
Them
That
Are
Just
Coming
And
Going
In
In
That
The
Actual
To
Yeah
The
The
Actual
Coven
Of
Hags
Themselves
Actually
Are
Are
Keep
Up
In
A
In
A
Group
Of
They
They
Keep
Up
In
A
In
Like
The
Rock
Outcropping
There's
A
Cave
Inside
There
That
Is
Guarded
By
Three
Of
The
The
Trueest
Believers
Of
The
Firewalker
Tribe
And
Also
The
Triumvirate
Leaders
Of
The
Actual
Goblins
Themselves
They
Live
Outside
The
Cave
And
That's
Actually
A
Distance
Away
From
The
Camp
Not
Like
So
Far
That
They
Can't
Like
Interact
But
Far
Enough
That
Like
It's
Like
You
Have
To
Be
Intentional
To
Go
And
Talk
To
The
Leaders
So
And
They
Have
Their
Lieutenants
That
Kind
Of
Facilitate
Like
The
Actual
Self
And
That's
Kind
Of
The
General
Layout
Give
Me
One
Second
Pop
Off
For
A
Second
Bye
Bye
Chris
All
Right
I'm
Back
Right
That
Was
Quick
What
Was
That
It
Was
It
Was
A
Very
It
Was
A
Very
Quick
Thing
So
Yeah
So
You've
Got
That
Rock
Outcropping
To
The
North
You
Can
Like
According
To
This
Goblin
Like
You
Can
Just
Kind
Of
Skip
The
Goblin
War
Camp
Completely
If
Your
Goal
Is
Just
Just
Velcro
So
You
Could
Basically
Just
Go
Straight
To
You
Would
Still
Have
To
Deal
With
The
Goblin
Leadership
But
You
Wouldn't
Be
You
Wouldn't
Necessarily
If
You
Followed
That
Path
Need
To
Go
Through
The
Entire
Army
To
Get
There
And
He
Gives
You
Exact
He
Gives
You
Exact
Instructions
On
Like
Where
Things
Are
Comparatively
As
Far
As
The
Actual
Distance
We're
Talking
Like
A
Matter
Of
A
Matter
Of
A
Half
Days
Force
March
To
Get
To
The
To
The
Cave
Itself
Okay
Okay
Very
Helpful
And
He
Seems
He
He
Also
Seems
To
Think
That
Like
You
Know
While
You
Could
Go
Through
The
Goblin
War
Camp
Your
Chances
Of
Survival
Are
A
Lot
Lower
Fighting
Your
Way
Through
The
Entire
Army
Than
Just
Skipping
The
Skipping
The
Small
Group
Or
Skipping
To
The
Small
Group
A
Lot
Less
Fun
Right
It's
True
I
Mean
You
Gotta
Do
What
You
Want
With
We
Fighting
Hundreds
And
Hundreds
Of
Hundreds
And
Hundreds
Of
Goblins
Feel
Free
Yeah
If
We
Had
An
Army
That
Would
Be
A
Different
Story
But
This
Is
A
Great
Way
To
Test
Our
Skills
Or
Even
If
We
Just
Had
20
You
Know
Comrades
Behind
Us
That
I
Be
Happy
Then
Anyway
Yeah
So
I
Mean
You
Do
Have
The
Namar
Zul
They're
They're
Relatively
Close
If
You
Wanted
To
Circle
Back
And
Grab
Them
And
Just
Wade
Through
All
The
Bad
Guys
But
You
Are
Also
Kind
Of
Working
With
The
Timeline
Yeah
This
Is
This
Is
Probably
Better
Left
To
You
Know
All
Task
Force
Quicken
Out
Strike
And
Though
The
Army
Will
Be
Leaderless
If
We're
Successful
And
That
That
That
Would
Be
Enough
To
Maybe
Not
Disband
Them
But
If we
Needed to
Go
Back
Through
And
Take
Care
Of
Them
It
Would
Be
A
Heck
Of
A
Lot
Easier
Job
Without
Them
Having
Organized
Grass
To
Lead
Them
Well
If
We're
Really
Successful
They
Might
Have
New
Leaders
Yeah
Yeah
Yep
Um
Okay
Uh
I'll
Pull
Out
My
Dagger
Or
My
Claws
Whichever
I
Whichever
I
Have
I
Don't
Know
If
I
Have
A
Dagger
I'll
Untie
Him
Anyway
Let's
Say
You
You
Have
Whatever
Whatever
The
Needful
Is
Right
You
Have
That
Yeah
I
Do
Have
A
Dagger
By
The
Way
I
I
Do
I
Tied
Him
Up
I
Can
Untie
Him
Yeah
All
Right
So
Um
After
You
You
Untie
Him
You
Give
Him
Your
Your
Letter
Of
Letter
Of
Introduction
Or
Whatever
It
Is
That
You
Produced
Um
Do
You
Have
Do
You
Have
Any
Idea
About
Kind
Of
Like
What
What
That
Would
What
That
Would
Be
Um
Check
With
Chat
GPT
I
I
Mean
I
Can
Check
I
Can
Check
With
Chat
GPT
If
You
Want
But
Like
I
Was
Just
You
Think
Would
It
Be
Would
It
Be
A
Personal
Item
Would
It
Be
Like
An
Actual
Letter
Would
Would
Do
You
Have
Like
A
Personal
Mark
That
You
Send
Him
With
Like
What
What
Would
What
Would
Samir
Have
And
You
Did
Travel
With
The
Band
For
A
While
So
You
Might
Have
Like
Some
Way
Of
Like
Doing
With
That
But
Yeah
I
Did
Yeah
I
Think
Really
The
Safest
Way
To
Do
Is
To
Give
Some
Sort
Of
Letter
Just
Having
A
Seal
Or
Personal
Artifact
It
Could
Be
Scavenged
From
A
Dead
Body
So
It
It's
Safer
For
Him
I
Think
If
It's
Some
Sort
Of
Note
Letter
Okay
All
Right
So
You
Load
Him
Up
With
A
Note
You
Tell
Him
Tell
Him
What
Direction
To
Go
He
Generally
He's
Familiar
With
The
Area
I
Mean
He
You
Worked
With
The
Fire
Walkers
That
Attack
Him
So
He
Knows
How
To
Get
To
The
Waste
And
That
Kind
Of
Stuff
So
He
Starts
He
You
Know
After
You
Let
Him
After
You
Let
Him
Out
He
Kind
Of
Rubs
His
Writh
A
Little
Bit
To
Get
The
Circulation
Going
Back
Getting
Back
Going
And
Then
He
Starts
Hoofing
It
As
Fast
As
He
Can
Go
The
Opposite
Direction
Of
Where
He
Just
Told
You
To
Go
And
He
Definitely
Kind
Of
Moving
Would
You
Like
Your
Sword
Might
Be
Helpful
Oh
He
Yeah
He
He
Grabs
A
Dog
Topper
On
His
Way
Out
He
He's
Not
Stupid
And
This
And
This
Swamp
Is
Dangerous
So
Right
After
After
A few
Minutes
You
You
Have
That
You
Have
That
Conversation
And
You
Start
You
Start
Feeling
The
Ground
Sort
Of
Like
Starts
To
Shake
So
It
Shakes
Then
Shakes
Big
Frog
Friends
Coming
And
You
Do
Look
North
And
You
Do
See
That
The
Giant
Frog
Monster
Is
Heading
In
Your
General
Direction
Time
To
Go
Yep
Eat
Those
Dead
Bodies
Right
Probably
That's
That would
Be your
Hope
Yes
Yeah
Hopefully
Not
Eating
Your
Life
Bodies
One of
Those
Things
Is
Much
More
Preferable
Yes
Yeah
Even
He
Was
Eating
My
Dead
Body
That
Would
Be
More
Preferable
Oh
Yeah
Yeah
Probably
But
Eating
Your
Body
In
General
Is
Not
That's
Not
The
Preferred
Method
Here
We're
Very
Very
Lucky
They'll
Do
It
In
That
Order
Yep
All right
So you
Guys
Are
Moving
You
Start
Following
The
The
Directions
Did
You
I
Pick
Up
That
You
Did
Land
On
On
The
Goblin
Suggestion
Of
Just
Skipping
The
War
Camp
And
Moving
On
To
The
The
Brass
And
That
Kind
Of
Thing
I
Think
So
Yeah
Yeah
I
Would
Like
To
Confirm
That
The
Goblins
Intel
Was
Accurate
Before
We
Just
You
Jump
Dick
First
Into
It
But
I
I'm
Sure
That
Can
Be
Easily
Arranged
Just
You
Know
As
We
Get
Close
We
Can
Start
Seeing
Things
But
Yeah
Yeah
So
There
Are
A
Couple
Things
That
He
Did
Share
With
You
About
Like
The
About
The
Leaders
Of
The
The
Leaders
Of
Firewalkers
The
Firewalkers
Are
Actually
Led
By
A
By
A
Female
Witch
By
The
Name
Of
Minar
Ghul
She
Is
Like
Like
Like
He
Said
A
True
Believer
In
In
The
In
The
Hags
Her
Like
In
The
Hags
And
Their
Plan
And
That
Kind
Of
Stuff
She
Is
Actively
Trying
To
Get
To
The
Point
Of
Like
Joining
Their
Coven
Like
That's
Her
That's
Her
End
Goal
Right
Now
She's
Kind
Of
Like
On
The
Outside
But
She
Wants
To
You
Know
She
Wants
To
Be
She
She's
A
Tag
And
Girl
Kind
Of
Thing
Um
Groupie
She's
She's
A
Goblin
Yeah
She's
Goblin
Got
It
Um
These
Three
Are
All
Goblins
Um
The
Other
You
You
You
Don't
In
In
D&D
There's
No
There's
No
Becoming
A
Hag
You're
Well
There
Maybe
There
Is
But
There's
No
Rule
About
How
To
Do
It
It's
A
Hag
Is
Just
A
Monster
That
Monster
So
Yeah
I
Just
Kind
Of
Figured
That's
Like
You
Were
Made
That
Way
Like
You
Don't
Get
To
Be
Right
Right
But
I
Mean
Witches
Witches
And
Hags
Kind
Of
Like
Have
A
Little
Bit
Of
A
Symbiotic
Sort
Of
Okay
Relationship
There
So
Like
You
Know
It
Could
Be
An
Unofficial
Member
Of
The
Coven
Or
You
Know
I'm
Not
Granting
Any
Actual
Like
Bonuses
Or
Anything
Like
That
But
The
Other
Two
The
Other
Two
Are
Are
Members
One
Is
Goes
By
The
Name
Of
Zabini
And
He
Is
A
Goblin
Monk
Who
Serves
As
His
Patron
Deity
He
Serves
For
The
Betrayer
And
He
Has
Linked
Himself
With
The
Hags
Because
The
Hags
Have
Have
Also
Kind of
Linked
Up
With
Vorath
So
It's
Kind of
Like
A
Alliance
Of
Situation
And
Then
The
Last
Is
Girlunk
Which
Is
A
Goblin
Ranger
And
He
Is
He's
One
Of
The
He's
Not
Really
A
Believer
He's
The
More
Pragmatic
Of
The
Three
But
He
Does
Realize
Like
That
Like
He's
Kind of
Like
Under
Service
Because
He sees
The
Value
In
What
The
Hag
Coven
Is
Bringing
To
To
Him
And
His
People
So
And
That
Is
Those
Are
Those
Are
The
Three
The
Three
That
The
Three
Leaders
So
Ramsey
You
Said
That
Power
Wanted
To
Confirm
The
Information
That
Was
Being
Given
Yeah
What
Would
He
Like
To
Do
In
Order
To
Be
Able
To
Assure
The
Info
Is
Good
So
I
Guess
I
Don't
Know
Maybe
We
Can
Just
Out
A
Little
Bit
Like
Largely
I
Just
Want
To
Confirm
That
You
Know
Where
He
Said
The
Leaders
Were
On
That
Rock
You
Know
Outcropping
Or
Whatever
Up
There
That
We
See
I
Know
We
Can't
Get
Too
Close
But
Yeah
Yeah
Just
As
Much
As
We
Can
Like
I
Don't
Want
To
Put
Too
Much
Risk
Into
It
But
Yeah
Yeah
Like
Oh
Hey
Yeah
There
Some
Rocks
Where
He
Said
There
Was
And
It
Looks
Like
Something's
Moving
Around
Up
There
Good
Enough
Okay
Yeah
Yeah
Easy
Enough
So
You
Move
So
You
Guys
Kind
Of
Like
Are
You
Going
To
Kind
Of
Check
Out
The
Goblin
War
Camp
At
All
Or
You
Gonna
Just
Kind
Of
Skip
Um
I
Think
Given
The
Army
Itself
A
Wide
Berth
Um
Okay
Is
Probably
Best
Okay
But
That's
Just
Considering
Yeah
Well
Especially
Considering
You
Got
A
Couple
Of
People
That
Aren't
Necessarily
Gonna
Be
Too
Quiet
Um
That's
Me
Low
And
Loud
Um
All
Right
So
You
Guys
Are
You
Guys
Move
Up
Through
The
Bogs
And
Over
Time
Like
You
Know
Again
You
Know
It's
It's
Not
It's
Not
A
Long
Distance
It's
Like
A
Four
Hour
March
But
Like
Right
When
You
Get
Beyond
Where
You
Were
Fighting
This
Guy
Or
These
These
Creatures
The
The
Swamp
Itself
Seems
To
Like
Dry
Up
A
Bit
And
What
You
And
What
You
Get
Is
More
Of
Like
A
Rocky
Um
Rocky
Grassland
Um
The
Um
Or
Not
Rocky
Grassland
But
Like
A
You
Know
More
Of
A
Mountainous
Region
Sort
Of
Thing
So
The
Bog
Itself
Kind
Of
Lends
It
Lends
Its
Way
To
Um
Kind
Of
Foothills
And
That
And
That
Sort
Of
Thing
No
Giant
Mountains
Just
Foothills
And
Rocky
Outcroppings
Um
As
You
Proceed
Further
Um
The
The
The
Air
Itself
Becomes
Less
Red
Less
Mystery
Misty
Although
The
Trees
Themselves
Kind
Of
Have
More
Of
A
Pinkish
View
To
The
Leaves
Um
Still
But
They're
Not
Um
They're
More
Like
Sacra
Blossoms
Than
They
Are
Um
Like
Blood
Red
And
What
You
Were
Seeing
In
The
Aquabog
Itself
Um
You
Do
Um
After
You
Move
Uh
You
Do
Definitely
See
The
Giant
Frog
Monster
It
Does
End
Up
Where
You
Guys
Were
And
It
Does
Appear
To
Be
Um
Concentrating
Its
Effort
On
Something
On
The
Ground
Um
You
Could
Assume
That
It
Is
Getting
Itself
Some
Um
Some
Carrion
Um
Over
Time
You
Do
You
Start
To
You
Start
To
See
The
Um
The
The
Uh
Countryside
It
It's
It's
That
It's
That
Rocky
Foothill
Sort
Of
Thing
Um
You
Do
You
Do
See
Um
Like
What
Do
You
Call
Um
Uh
Like
Wooden
Stakes
That
That
Are
Set
Up
For
Uh
Defensive
Um
Defensive
Notions
There's
A
Bridge
That
That
That
You
See
In
The
Distance
And
There
Is
That
Rocky
Outcropping
That
Looks
Um
Almost
Exactly
Like
What
The
What
The
When
Uh
That
You
Questioned
Um
What
He
Uh
What
He
Described
Um
You
See
Some
Smoke
Coming
Out
From
Uh
From
Behind
The
Um
Behind
The
Wood
Wall
Um
There
And
You're
Not
You're
Not
Close
Enough
To
Be
An
Earshot
Or
Anything
But
There's
Definitely
Signs
Of
Life
And
And
It's
And
This
Appears
To
Be
More
Like
A
Miniature
Goblin
Fort
Sort
Of
Thing
Is
That
Enough
Sounds
Like
Enough
To
Develop
A
Strategy
And
It's
Not
A
Perfect
Analogy
But
Basically
What
You
See
Is
What's
Kind
Of
In
The
In
The
Pain
There
Um
So
You've
Got
That
Jutting
Rock
That
That's
Coming
Out
You
You
See
A
You
See
A
You
See
A
That's
Coming
Out
From
Under
That
Again
It's
Pretty
Heavy
In
The
Distance
The
Trees
Themselves
Are
More
Are
Are
Less
Green
And
What
This
Picture
Describes
They're
Kind
Of
Like
This
Pink
Color
But
It's
It's
Pretty
Close
To
What
You
See
Here
Alright
What's
The
Plan
Well
Far
Out
From
This
Are
We
Yeah
What'd
You
Say
Jason
How
Far
Out
From
This
Are
We
I
Mean
You're
Out
Of
You're
Out
Of
You're
Out
Of
Ear
Distance
But
You
Are
You
Know
You're
Definitely
Within
Sight
So
It's
Kind
Of
One
Of
Those
Things
Where
I'm
Basically
Kind
Of
Thinking
That
You
Guys
Are
Probably
Like
Kind
Of
Hugging
The
Cliff
Side
Here
A
Little
Bit
You
Know
Trying
To
Keep
Yourself
Keep
Yourself
Out
Sight
You
Aren't
So
Close
That
I'm
Going
To
Require
A
Stealth
Roll
Um
But
You
Are
But
If
You're
Just
Kind
Of
Walking
In
Old
As
Brass
If
Anybody
Care
To
Look
They
Would
Probably
Be
Able
To
See
You
So
Um
Because
There's
Not
Like
I mean
There's
A little
Bit
Of
Foliage
Between
Like
The
Rock
Face
And
The
Thing
But
It's
Not
Like
It's
Not
The
Best
Yeah
I mean
This
Is
A
This
Is
Supposed
To
Be
A
Defensible
Location
So
It's
Kind
Of
That
Way
Although
I'm
Not
Saying
That
You
Couldn't
Come
Up
With
A
Way
Being
Able
To
Kind
Of
Drop
In
Unannounced
And
That
Kind
Of
Stuff
But
It
Would
Have
To
Be
More
Of
A
Plan
Than
A
I'm
Just
Rolling
A
Stealth
Roll
You
Know
The
Plan
May
Involve
A
Stealth
Roll
Probably
Will
Um
I
Am
Going
To
Suggest
That
We
Are
With
Within
Range
Of
The
Ranger
Uh
If
He's
Out
Being
A
Ranger
Scouting
And
All
That
Stuff
He's
Probably
Behind
Us
Tracking
Us
Right
Now
Um
Wouldn't
Hurt
My
Feelings
If
We
Try
To
Set
Up
An
Ambush
And
Take
Him
Alive
Well
Maybe
Not
Alive
Per
Se
But
Um
Alone
Fair
Enough
Any
Ideas
Thought
Strategies
For
Such
An
Endeavor
That's
Not
A
Bad
Idea
My
My
Only
Concern
Is
We're
Pressed
For
Time
I
Don't
Know
If
We
Have
The
Time
To
Be
Waiting
I
Mean
That's
True
Too
Fair
Point
Um
I
It's
A
Good
Idea
But
Um
Um
If
There
Is
A
Like
Side
Or
Back
Or
Something
To
This
Thing
That
Is
Not
On
Guarded
But
Maybe
Less
Guarded
Uh
Mostly
Due
To
You
Know
It
Having
A
Giant
Cliff
Face
I
May
Be
Able
To
Help
Get
Us
Up
There
I
Just
It's
Hard
To
You
Know
Determine
From
That
One
Picture
But
But
Looking
At
The
Totality
Of
The
Place
Chris
Does
It
Look
Like
There's
Something
Like
That
Uh
Yeah
I
Mean
Uh
The
The
The
Rock
Outcropping
Itself
Isn't
Like
Against
A
Cliff
Wall
Or
Anything
So
If
You
Wanted
To
Go
Around
And
Kind
Of
Try
And
Come
Up
The
Come
Up
The
Back
Side
Um
That
Would
Be
Doable
Um
It
Probably
Would
Involve
Some
Climbing
And
Some
Scaling
Of
Some
Uh
Of
Some
Uh
Rock
Walls
And
Cliffs
But
Um
You
Know
At
Least
From
Your
General
Like
There's
There's
Kind
Of
The
Face
That
You're
Pressing
Up
Against
But
It
Doesn't
Seem
Like
This
Is
Like
Going
Straight
Out
Of
A
Rock
You
Know
The
The
The
The
Rock
That's
Jetting
Out
You
Could
Probably
Kind
Of
Work
Your
Way
Around
And
Come
Out
On
That
Um
That
Is
About
Um
30
Foot
In
The
Air
From
The
From
The
Actual
Bottom
So
So
Like
If
You
Wanted
To
Drop
In
Um
You'd
Have
To
Have
Some
Sort
Of
Solution
For
That
Um
But
You know
That
Would
Be
More
Self
Confused
With
The
Other
Guy
Oh
Yeah
I
Can
No
I
Don't
Think
I
Can
Do
That
Wrong
Character
Right
So
Hold on
Let me
Let me
Make sure
I heard
You
Correct
There
Chris
So
You're
Saying
That
We
Can
Get
Up
Above
Them
But
It's
30
Feet
Down
To
Where
They
Are
Right
That's
What
I'm
Saying
Like
I
Mean
From
The
Top
Of
The
Top
Of
The
Rock
Like
If
You're
Looking
At
That
Rock
That's
Shutting
Out
Like
You
Can
Work
Your
Way
To
Be
On
Top
Of
That
But
To
Drop
Down
Into
The
Actual
Like
Amp
Itself
That's
A
30
Foot
Drop
Yeah
By
Your
Estimation
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Excellent
Let's
Do
That
Okay
I
Have
A
Thing
I
Have
A
Plan
Oh
No
Yeah
Yeah
Now
What
Do
We
Go
I'm
Not
Saying
You
Know
Whatever
But
When
We
Go
Let's
Go
That
Way
Okay
I
Do
Like
The
Idea
Of
Trying
To
Take
This
This
Ranger
One
On
One
If
We
Can
I'm
Just
Concerned
Because
They've
Got
The
We
Might
Be
Sitting
In
Wait
For
A
While
Exactly
Exactly
I
Hear
Yeah
That's
A
Thought
I
Had
To
Well
We
Can
Start
Getting
Ourselves
Repositioned
I
Think
Like
We
Need
To
Be
Actively
Looking
For
This
Ranger
Dude
Yeah
I
Could
I
Would
Guess
That
He's
Out
Here
I
Was
A
Ranger
I
Would
Be
Sure
Sure
Unless
Unless
There
Was
A
Specific
Meeting
That
Called
Me
In
Yeah
Um
Um
Anyway
Keep
Your
Eyes
Peeled
I
Will
Happily
Try
To
Cover
Our
Tracks
All
Right
That
Sounds
Like
A
Survival
If
There
Is
A
Body
Who
Can
Do
That
Better
Than
Me
Please
Or
That
With
Me
Someone
Else
Had
Survival
Not
Me
Someone
I
I
Have
I
I
Don't
Know
What
I
Have
Survival
I
Have
Plus
Zero
One
Train
Hey
Look
At
Another
Not
One
Excellent
That
Was
Terrible
Oh
Oh
Oh
Yeah
Carrier
Has
Survival
Look
At
That
Good
Job
Buddy
Thanks
For
Not
Rolling
A
Three
Well
You
Improved
Yeah
Yep
That
Does
Remind
Me
That's
Hurtful
We
Can
Just
Keep
Moving
Back
To
My
You
Do
Have
Hero
Points
If
You
Wish
To
Be
Using
Those
But
Do
Not
Forget
Your
Hero
Point
Um
Okay
Yep
There
Is
One
Yeah
Uh
No
I'm
Quite
Quite
Confident
We're
Doing
A
Great
Job
Of
Hiding
Our
Okay
So
Kahir
Like
So
Samir
Basically
Does
Does
The
Old
Trick
Of
Hitting
A
Tree
Branch
And
Kind
Of
Rubbing
It
Behind
Him
Meanwhile
Kahir
Ends
Up
Taking
A
Taking
A
Few
More
Steps
But
Is
Able
To
And
Is
Able
To
Up
Obscure
The
Tracks
Even
Further
Um
So
For
The
People
Who
Are
Not
Actively
Trying
To
Lose
Their
Tracks
Um
I
If
You
Want
To
Keep
An
Eye
Out
For
Said
Ranger
You
Are
More
Than
Welcome
To
Do
So
Alrighty
Sounds
Good
We
Were
Trying
Oh
Gosh
It
Rolled
Off
From
The
15
It
Was
Right
There
Well
I
Mean
Really
Making
A
Lot
Of
Attack
Rolls
Here
We're
Gonna
We're
Gonna
Reroll
That
There
We
Go
Oh
Yeah
Yeah
It's
A
Much
Better
Roll
Okay
Uh
Carson
Are
You
Gonna
Keep
An
Eye
Out
As
Well
Or
I
Am
Am
I
Doing
A
Perception
Check
That
Is
Exactly
What
I'm
Looking
For
Uh
Sorry
Just
You
Want
Just
Perception
Or
Like
Seek
Uh
Perception
Seek
Is
Something
You
Do
In
Combat
But
This
Is
Specific
Oh
That's
That's
Fine
Jason
That's
That's
A
That's
A
That's
A
Wasted
Roll
Anyway
Uh
Wow
I'm
Doing
Really
Good
You're
Doing
Really
Good
Yeah
Samir
Samir
Is
Busy
Trying
To
Cover
Up
Tracks
He
Doesn't
Have
He
Doesn't
Have
Mental
Energy
To
Perceive
And
Cover
Up
Tracks
At
The
Same
Time
Which
Is
Why
You
Roll
The
Two
So
There
You
All
Right
Um
All
Right
Oh
On
Your
Travels
Through
The
Like
Kind
Of
Taking
The
Long
Way
Around
You
Are
Able
To
Navigate
Through
The
Forest
This
Forest
Is
Kind
Of
There
Are
Some
Things
About
It
That
Especially
For
Those
Who
You
Trained
In
Survival
There
Are
Some
Things
About
It
That
Are
Kind
Of
Odd
The
The
Most
Interesting
Thing
Is
The
Color
Of
The
Leaves
But
There
Also
Just
Appears
To
Be
Some
Other
Worldly
Aspect
To
This
Place
It
Just
Kind
Of
Seems
Like
You
See
Fungus
That
Is
The
Wrong
Color
You
See
Like
You
Know
Just
Things
That
Are
They
Look
Right
But
Slightly
Off
You
Know
It's
Just
Very
Small
Sorts
Of
Things
Going
On
There
Um
So
Um
You
Throughout
The
Um
Throughout
The
Uh
Area
You
Don't
You
Don't
Happen
Across
The
Ranger
Um
In
The
Actual
Like
Um
In
The
Actual
Forest
Itself
However
Um
Once
You
Get
Relatively
Close
To
Where
That
Rock
Outcropping
Is
Um
Outwear
You
Specifically
Do
Note
That
You
See
Movement
At
The
Edge
Of
The
Um
At
The
Edge
Of
The
Outcropping
Once
You
Actually
Notice
It
And
Kind
Of
Point
It
Out
Um
Karsten
You
Notice
It
As
Well
There
Is
Definitely
Like
Some
Something
Or
Someone
That's
Kind
Of
Like
At
The
At
The
Tip
Um
Over
There
Okay
Um
Okay
And
If
You
Were
A
Ranged
Combatant
And
You
Were
Um
Kind
Of
Expecting
Some
Sort
Of
Some
Sort
Of
Attack
At
Some
Point
Or
Another
You
Might
Want
To
Set
Yourself
Up
On
A
Pretty
Nice
Overwatch
Vantage
Point
Um
So
He
Was
Smart
Yeah
Um
Interesting
Um
Um
Um
Ah
Okay
Okay
So
We've
Got
A
Guy
Okay
Um
We've
Never
Seen
Any
Of
These
People
Right
Or
Seen
Depictions
Of
Them
Or
Statues
Or
Paintings
Or
Anything
I
Don't
Think
We
Have
We
Have
Not
So
Far
As
I
Know
Oh
I
May
Have
Lost
Chris
All
Right
I'm
Back
Okay
Chris
We've
We've
Not
Ever
Seen
Either
Any
Of
These
Individuals
Or
Any
Depictions
Of
Them
Before
Have
We
Correct
Okay
All right
All right
All right
They look
Like
Yeah
Yeah
You
This
This
You
You
Would
Assume
That
This
Is
Gerlunk
Based
Off
Of
The
Description
Also
Again
This
Is
Kind
Of
One
Of
Those
Like
You
You
Saw
The
Previous
Goblin
Warrior
Right
Um
And
You've
Seen
Other
Goblins
Like
Grim
Fang
And
That
Kind
Of
Thing
The
This
Guy
There's
Like
Again
There's
Just
Something
Off
About
Him
He
Almost
Has
This
Like
Fae
Like
Quality
About
Him
He
Looks
He
Looks
Like
Almost
Like
There's
Some
Like
He
Like
There's
Either
Like
A
Fairy
Or
Elf
Or
Some
Sort
Of
Like
Um
Some
Sort
Of
Like
Quality
Um
That
He
Has
Like
His
Head
Isn't
Like
Huge
And
Bulbous
It's
More
Proportional
Like
He
You know
He
Just
Looks
Um
Looks
Odd
For
A
Goblin
But
He
Is
Most
Assuredly
A
Goblin
Okay
Okay
Um
And
Oh
Man
Um
Arston
Orca
Here
How
Uh
How good
At acting
Are you
Guys
Uh
Boy
You're
Asking a
Real
Difficult
Question
In
Real
Life
Zero
Is it
Isn't it
Acting
An
Actual
Skill
I
Like
Deception
Or
Performance
Or
Yeah
My
Performance
I get a
Plus two
Uh huh
Uh huh
Uh
Deception
Wherever
I
Don't
How come
These don't
Seem like
They're
In
Logical
There it
Is
Plus two
Untrained
Okay
Okay
Okay
And
Performance
Untrained
So you
Know
I got a
Plus two
Though
Oh
Nevermind
It wouldn't
Work either
Way
Uh
It would
Have to be
Me
Okay
Um
Let me
Consider
For a
Moment
Before
I do
Something
Stupid
You're
An elf
Right
Jason
Samir's
An elf
Yeah
You're
Still
Way
Too
Tall
Um
Mm
Mm
I'd
Have to
Be
You know
One
Standing
On top
Of
The
Other
Shoulders
Okay
Okay
Okay
Okay
Um
Well
That still
Could
Work
They
Would
At least
Give
Us
Ah
No
He's
Too
I don't
Know
I'm
Gonna
Try
It
Cause
I
Want
To
Try
It
And
It's
Gonna
Be
Cool
So
I'm
Gonna
Do
It
All
Right
Let's
Do
I
Don't
Think
This
Is
Gonna
Work
But
Damn
It
It's
Gonna
Be
Awesome
All
Right
You
Say
That
Now
Uh
So
Here's
The
Game
Um
I'm
Gonna
Go
Uh
How
Far
Away
Are
We
From
Set
At
Rock
Outcropping
Um
Well
Back
In
The
Woods
I
Imagine
Yeah
So
In
Order
For
You
To
Actually
Get
Close
Enough
To
Like
Get
On
The
Battle
Map
You
Would
Definitely
Need
To
Have
A
Stealth
Roll
Um
To
Be
Able
To
Get
In
There
Without
Being
Noticed
Now
Yeah
Yeah
Um
You
At
This
Point
I'm
Like
You're
Far
Enough
Out
Out
That
You
That
You
Know
Just
An
Abundance
Of
An
Abundance
Of
Caution
Won't
Necessarily
Give
Him
Any
Reason
To
See
What's
Going
On
Also
You're
Coming
From
A
Direction
That
He's
Not
Expecting
So
Um
You
You're
Not
In
A
Place
Where
You're
Visible
At
The
Moment
But
Let's
Say
100
Yards
Like
Football
Field
Behind
Him
Okay
Is
Where
You
Currently
Are
In
Order
To
Be
Able
To
Get
Close
To
Him
That
Be
Here
Um
Yeah
In
Order
To
Be
Able
To
Actually
Get
Like
On
The
Out
Cropping
That's
That's
About
10
Yards
Away
So
You
You
Would
Need
To
Start
Rolling
Stealth
Probably
Once
You
Get
Once
You
Closed
About
Half
The
Distance
Of
Where
You
Are
Now
So
Like
50
Yards
In
Or
150
Feet
Um
Okay
Okay
Okay
Once
We
Okay
All right
So
We
Can
Get
To
About
150
Away
Before
We
Start
To
Make
Checks
Okay
All right
Actually
That
Was
A long
Explanation
For
A
Very
Simple
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
No
No
That's
Great
That's
Great
So
We're
150
Feet
Out
Essentially
Um
Here's
Here's
My plan
Guys
Um
I'm
Gonna
Disguise
Myself
And go
Have a
Little
Chat
With
Him
Um
I
Think
My goal
Is
To
See
If
I
Can
Get
Him
To
Magically
Um
Kind of
Be in a
Bit of
A stupor
Um
When I
Signal
Or
When
He attacks
Me
Come
Running
I'm
Running
Um
I can
Get
Us
Down
Too
That's
That's
No
Problem
Uh
But
We
Gotta
Take
Care
Of
This
Guy
First
Uh
Second
Question
Chris
We
Have
Seen
Statues
Or
Depictions
Of
Uh
What's
His
Name
Volrath
Right
You
Have
Yes
Ooh
Fun
Excellent
Um
Do I
Want
To
Do
That
I
Don't
Think
I
Want
To
Do
That
I
Think
I
Think
I
Think
I
Do
Better
So
I
Want
To
Take
My
Newly
Acquired
Scroll
Case
Of
Occult
Uh
Whatever
Simplicity
Uh
I'm
Going
To
Consume
The
Scroll
That's
In
It
Uh
Get
Rid
Of
That
Uh
That
Whatever
It
Was
Curse
Of
Yada
Yada
Not
Going
To
Use
This
Anymore
Uh
Recoil
Recoil
Yes
Let
Make
Sure
I
Actually
Delete
That
However
Have
Have
We
Not
Seen
Um
We
Not
Seen
Velcro
You
Have
You
Specifically
Jason
Or
Not
Jason
You
Specifically
Samir
Have
Seen
Velcro
You
Saw
Her
In
The
Um
In
Your
Artifact
In
The
Um
Mirror
Of
Ashes
Okay
Um
What
You
Saw
Where
We
Saw
But
Okay
What
You
Saw
Was
This
Um
A
Uh
A
A
Old
Um
Old
Decrepit
Woman
With
Glowing
Red
Eyes
And
I
Pull
That
Image
Up
In
This
Artifact
Um
That's
A
Good
Question
Arwall
Would
Would
That
Be
Helpful
Alwar
Sorry
Um
Narwhal
That
Suit
Your
In
Your
Plans
Maybe
Maybe
I
I
Don't
I
I
I
I
Think
The
The
Size
Works
The
The
Wrong
Way
In
That
Case
I
Think
I'm
Too
Small
Yeah
That's
True
Yeah
That's
True
The
Hags
Are
Quite
Large
Also
Somehow
I
Lost
All
Of
These
Names
I
Typed
Them
Out
In
My
Notes
But
They
Are
Gone
So
Velcro
Is
The
Hag
This
Dude

Grunk
Grunk

Alright

So

Squirreled
Again
Sorry
Alt
Scroll
Case
Of
Simplicity
Oh
No
It
Wasn't
You
It
Was
Me
And
I'm
Going
To
Use
It
To
Cast
Illusory
Disguise
On
Myself
Chris
Okay
I'm
Going
To
Disguise
Myself
To
Look
Almost
Exactly
Like
What I
Am
Seeing
In
Front
Of
Me
So
Almost
Exactly
Like
Gerlunk
Except
I'm
Gonna
Make
It
Like
A
Little
Darker
A
Little
Shadow
Shadow
Here
And
I'm
Trying
To
See
If
I
Have
What
Do
I
Have
Here
What
Do
I
Have
Here
Yeah
Excellent
And
Then
I'm
Going
To
Use
The
Figment
Cantrip
To
Just
Create
Kind
Of
Like
Shadows
Almost
Kind
Of
Like
Coming
Off
Of
Me
Visually
Just
A
Visual
Illusion
Of
Like
Shadows
Kind
Of
Coming
Up
Almost
Like
Like
Heat
Waves
But
You
Know
Kind
Of
Shadowy
Okay
And
Then
I'm
Just
Gonna
Just
Walk
At
The
Guy
We're
Not
Stealthing
We're
Not
Nothing
We're
Just
Walking
Okay
Let
See
Here
You're
You're
Doing
The
Minor
Illusion
From
The
Item
Right
Yep
Yep
Illusory
Disguise
There
It
Comes
Three
Skies
Right
Trying to
See what
Sort of
Save
We need
On
That
If
There
Is
A
Save
For
Yeah
It's
A
Disguise
Or
Deception
On
My
Part
I
Think
Yeah
So
For
The
Impersonate
Use
Deception
Ignores
Any
Circumstance
Penalties
Or
Target
Might
Take
Disguising
Itself
As
A
Discipline
Of
Creature
With
A
Plus
Four
Status
Bonus
Deception
Checks
Okay
Uh
Huh
So
You get
Plus
Four
Deception
Sweet
That's
Okay
I
Might
Regret
Using
Hero
Point
But
That's
Fine
That's
Pretty
Okay
Ish
Okay
Okay
Stairs
A
Fair
Chance
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Let's
See
He
Is
Okay
Okay
So you
Start walking
At him
What's your
General disposition
Here
Um
I am
Taking
A
Position
Of
Kind
Of
Authority
Bordering
Bordering
On
Arrogance
Okay
Um
You get
About
You get
About
60 feet
Out
And he
All of a
Sudden
Just kind
Of whirls
Around
Has
Has
His bow
Um
His bow
Bent
He's ready
To fire
And then he
Looks at
You
And
He looks
Confused
But his
His bow
String is
Still tight
And he
Just
Who are
Um
I
Without
Breaking
Much
Stride
Um
I
Will
Uh
Say
Um
Uh
Gerlunk
Vigilant
As always
Um
That won't
Serve you
Here
You know
Who I
Am
That's
Pretty
Good
Okay
Um
He looks
Confused
For a
Moment
Mm
Mm
Kind of
Looks
Down
Still
Holding
His
Still
Holding
His blow
Very
Very
Tight
Very
Well
Trained
Looks
Back
Up
And
Says
Father
So good
To see
You
Says
Master
What are
You doing
Here
I was
Told that
You weren't
Able to
Manifest
In this
Realm
And he
Is
And he
Said
But he
Also
Says
And if
It's all
The same
To you
I'd
Ask that
You
Stop
Where you
Are
How far
Away am
I at
This
Point
Um
So
I'd
Say that
You probably
Got to
About
30 foot
Out
Before
He
Before
He
Asked
You
To
Stop
Because
You
Weren't
You
Weren't
Breaking
Stride
At
All
So
I
Didn't
Imagine
You
Were
Running
But
You
Know
At
The same
Time
Like
You
Know
So
You
Probably
Got
Another
30 foot
In
Before
He
Before
He
Asks
You
To
Stop
Yep
Yep
Yep
Excellent
Excellent
Um
Okay
Cool
Cool
Cool
Cool
Cool
Um
So
Yeah
I'll
Kind of
Plaster
A big
Smile
On my
Face
And
And
Stop
And
Kind of
Nod
At him
And
Say
It
Makes
You
More
Comfortable
I
Suppose
You're
Right
I'm
Not
Really
Here
This
Is
In
Your
Mind
I've
Come
To
Speak
We
Have
Betrayal
Among
Us
I
Never
Trusted
Velcro
I
Knew
She
Was
I
Knew
She
Was
Only
Using
You
For
Your
For
Your
Strength
And
As soon
As she
Found
Another
Another
More
Um
A
Better
Situation
She
Would
Move
On
Tell
Me
How
Do
Um
Tell
Me
How
Should
We
Deal
With
Her
Plan
Is
Already
In
Motion
There
Is
A
Group
Coming
Very
Soon
They're
Looking
For
Her
Head
As well
As your
Other
Companions
All you
Simply
Have to
Do
Is
Nothing
Um
I'm
I'm
I'm
I'm
I'm
I'm
I'm
I'm
I'm
I need
You
To
Make
A
Roll
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
For
This
One
Um
Let's
Go
Ahead
And
Go
With
A
Diplomacy
Diplomacy
Where are you
I
I
Suppose
Oh
Oh my
God
Nice
Natural 20
Or a
32
To convince
A ranger
Okay
Who already
Believes that
He's speaking
To his
Master
That he
Just
Need to
Kind of
Make himself
Scarce for
A little
Bit
All right
Um
He
He
Will
He
He
Will
Uh
He'll
Stop
He'll
Think
For a
Moment
He'll
Look
Down
At his
He'll
Look
Down
At his
Allies
You
See
A flash
Of
Concern
And
Pain
But then
He looks
Down
At his
Feet
Like
As if
He was
Staring
Through
The rock
Self
And this
Impish
Grin
Comes across
His face
He says
Very
Well
I needed
To do
Some hunting
Anyway
And
With
With that
He
Kind of
Just
Makes
His way
Off
Into the
Forest
To the
North
And
You've
Officially
Convinced
Nice job
There
There you
Go
That went
Way better
Than I
Thought it
Was going
To
Yeah
That's
Pretty
Spectacular
You know
My original
Plan was
Just to get
Close enough
To him
And then
Whammy him
With some
Magic
But
As he
Was talking
I'm like
I got
I got
Another plan
Let's see
If this
Works
Nice job
It worked
I'm
I'm
Gonna
As
When he's
Like
Gone
I'm
Gonna
Drop
The
Shadow
Like
Part of
The illusion
That was
A separate
Spell
And
Kind of
You know
Jester
For everyone
Else
To
Kind of
Come
Up
And
We do
Nice job
I love
This
That was
Awesome
Nice job
All right
As you
Guys
Walk
Up
Couple
Things
You do
Notice
That the
Stone
And you
Notice
This as
Well
Our
But you
Were a
Little bit
More
You were
A little
Bit
Focused
At the
Moment
But the
Actual
Like
Ledge
Itself
It does
Have that
30 foot
Drop
But there
Is also
A
Walkway
To get
Onto
Onto
The ledge
That you
Weren't
Like
It's just
Kind of
Like
The rock
Formations
Would allow
You to
Kind of
Navigate
Up
And down
Into
The camp
If you
Wanted
To
As well
So
Don't
Necessarily
Need to
Bomb
Down
But if
You
Had
But your
Bomb
Down
Plan
Would
Also work
Very well
You do
See in
The
In the
On the
Ground
There is
A female
Problem
That is
Specifically
Kind of
By the
Fire
She's got
Cauldron
Bubbling
You know
She appears
To be
Doing some
Sort of
Like
Herbal
Remedy
Slash
Magic
Thing
And then
Off
Kind of
Like
Towards
The front
Of
The
Of the
Of the
Wood wall
There is
A
Another
Male
Goblin
Who
Is
Dressed
In
Leathers
And
In leather
In like
A leather
Jerkin
And
Has
Some
Baggy
Some
Baggy
Free
Moving
Pants
Like
Easy
To move
In
And he's
Got like
A
Fertless
Jerkin
And he's
Basically
Kind of
Pacing
Back and
Forth
And
Occasionally
Looking
Outside
The wall
As if
He's
Expecting
Something
I am
Going
To
If
Any
Like
You got
To this
Point
This is
What you
See
Any
Additional
Movement
From this
Point
Forward
Is going
To require
A stealth
Check
In order
For you
To not
Be
Not
Be
Not
You are
As far
As you
Can
Go
Without
Just
Barreling
In
Okay
So
Just
For my
Visual
So
There's
The rock
Outcropping
And there's
Like a
Already
Stairs
Going down
You said
Or like
Further
Back
Or
Yeah
So let
Me just
Go ahead
And load
The battle
Map
Because I
Think
We've
Got
Everything
Kind of
Set up
There
And
Hopefully
That will
Make sense
To
Yeah
So
We're
Waiting
For
Ramsey
To load
And Jason
To load
Hey
I'm gonna
Reload
I got a
Fail message
Of some
Kind
Yeah
Yeah I've
Been having
Some problems
With the
VTT
Tonight
As well
Reload
So
There it
Goes
Alright
Let's see
What happens
Ah
Okay
So
Yeah
Um
So like
There's
These rock
Formations
Yeah exactly
So you could
Make your way
Down that way
Or you could
Just drop
Off
Over here
Uh huh
Uh huh
Uh huh
You know
And this point
Is like a
30 foot rock
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Okay
Uh
And
The
Oh so
This
Hold on
Let me
Make sure
I see this
Correctly
This kind
Of stairwell
Goes all
The way
Around
Like through
Here
Right
Is
What that
Looks like
It
It's uh
Drop here
Here
Yeah
Here
It goes
To here
And then
Oh okay
Okay
There
I mean you could
Go all the way
Around
Kind of like
What you were
Looking at
There
But either
One of those
Is a step
Down
Gotcha
Um
Okay
And the
Female
Uh
Female
Witch
Is
There
Uh huh
Um
Again
These
Goblins
Don't
Look as
Grotesque
As
Goblins
Usually do
They
They look like
They've got
Some sort of
Like
Fae
Mutation
Or
Fae
Blood
In them
Um
I was
I was noticing
How attractive
She was
Yeah
And the
Uh
And the
And the
Monk
Likewise
Um
That
Likewise
Looks
Um
Again
You know
Looks
Kind of like
Elvin
In nature
Um
Is the best
Way you can
Describe it
But
They don't
Look
It's not like
They're half
Elf
Half
Goblins
Like
They're
Just
They just
Look
Elvin
Um
So
There's
Something
That's
Happened
To
Them
Yeah
Yep
Okay
Um
I'm just
Trying to
Think
Yeah
No
I think
That's
Really
For
The
Best
So
Here's
Here's
What I
Had in
Mind
Guys
And you
Tell me
Melee
Specifically
What you
Would
Rather
Do
Cause
I'm
Fine
Being
Up
Here
But
You
Guys
Need
To
Get
In
Close
Um
I
Have
A
Scroll
Of
The
Spell
Helpful
Steps
And
What
That
Does
Is
It
Allows
Me
To
Create
A
40
Foot
Tall
Ladder
Or
Staircase
So
I
Can
I
Can
Just
Straight
Up
Make
A
Staircase
That
Descends
Like
From
This
Point
Going
Down
And
Just
Kind
Of
Get
You
Direct
Access
To
Their
Faces
Yeah
That
Was
Their
Pants
Which
Seems
Better
Than
This
But
We
May
Have
To
Roll
Some
Stealth
To
Not
Make
Noise
Over
Here
Uh
No
Way
Uh
Or
You
Know
I
Just
Make
It
And
Go
Or
I
Can
Make
It
From
This
Point
Down
Even
Because
We're
Kind
Of
Right
There
Right
Yeah
Like
Start
The
Staircase
Here
And
Just
Go
Down
And
Well
That
Was
Kind
Of
My
Thought
Yeah
I
Don't
Have
Any
Uh
You
Know
Dog
In
The
Fight
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Jason
Likewise
Or
Amir
Likewise
Is
Perfectly
Happy
To
Be
Yeah
Cause
Like
Making
This
Circuit
Around
Is
Going
To
Be
More
Steps
I
Think
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
That's
That's
My
Plan
That's
What
I'm
Gonna
Do
I
Agree
Yeah
I
Mean
Get
Us
Close
Yeah
When
We're
Ready
So
That's
That's
What
I'm
Gonna
Do
So
Alright
Cool
Alright
So
Um
We
Have
An
Option
At
This
Point
It
Is
9
55
I
Know
That
People
Like
To
Stop
At
10
So
We
Can
Stop
Right
Now
And
Initiate
The
Battle
At
The
Beginning
Of
Our
Next
Session
Or
We
Can
I
I
Don't
Know
This
Is
Christmas
Week
People
Might
Have
Are
Off
And
They
Might
Have
A
Little
Bit
More
Flexibility
As
Far
As
Like
Bad
Times
Are
Concerned
So
We
Can
Jump
Into
This
Battle
If
You
Want
To
Either
Way
I
Am
Cool
I'm
Game
For
Whatever
Yeah
Um
And
Let

Yes
And
Scott
Same
To
You
Like
If
You're
If
You're
If
You're
Happy
To
Be
Done
Right
Now
Then
We
Can
Just
Call
It
And
I
Am
Not
Going
To
Be
Up
At
All
Are
We
Planning
We
Already
Got
Rid
Of
One
Of
My
Guys
But
You
Know
Are
We
Planning
To
Play
On
January
6th
Again
Yep
Yep
So
I
Should
Be
Back
From
Texas
By
Then
So
I
Don't
Think
That
At
Least
For
Me
I
Don't
Think
That
There's
Any
Hitching
My
Giddy
Up
As
Far
As
Like
When
We're
Meeting
For
Pathfinder
So
I'm
Good
To
Pick
It
Up
On
The
6th
Actually
It
Would
Probably
Be
Better
For
Me
To
Pick
It
Up
On
The
6th
Sure
Okay
Yeah
Absolutely
I
Always
Like
I
Always
Like
Ending
These
On
A
Cliffhanger
And
When
You're
About
To
Jump
And
Kill
A
Bunch
Of
Kill
A
Couple
Of
Elven
Looking
Goblins
That
Seems
Cliffhanger
Enough
For
Me
Perfect
Thank
You
So
Much
It
Was
A
Good
Night
Thanks
Chris
It
Is
On
The
Can
So
We'll
Not
Be
Late
Next
Time
Yeah
All
Right
We
Will
See
You
Guys
In
The
New
Year
All
Right
Yeah
Yep
Merry
Christmas
Y'all
Yep
Sounds
Good
All
Right
Oh
Man
You
Have
That
I
Was
Better
Than
I
Expected
Yeah
My
Deligerent
About
It
But
Like
I
Mean
You
You
You
Did
A
Good
Thing
So
I
Was
Like
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
My
First
Thought
Was
I
Checked
The
Illusory
Disguise
I
Can
Put
On
Other
People
They
Just
You
Know
Making
That
Deception
Roll
Might
Be
Dodgy
But
My
First
Thought
Was
To
Disguise
Someone
And
Just
Get
Close
Enough
To
Him
To
