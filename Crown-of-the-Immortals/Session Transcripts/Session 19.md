Alright. So when last we met, you were in the in the Temple Of Cadence, you found these brand new slash really, really old relics that belonged to a previous self. Upon touching, upon picking up each of the relics, you found yourselves caught up in a vision, that further explained the relics and the people that you used to be. And then afterwards, you listen to a story that, Argyle gave gave you, concerning your previous selves. You had you then had a few conversations with him as as as you were as as you were curious about what was going on.

And then you, and then he raised the temple from the bottom of the from the bottom of the lake. The temple rose to the top of the top of the lake. It is now a floating temple, and you found a way or and you saw that, Oloru was under attack. You found your way over there and fought, a bunch of goblins that were, along with, Prince Troubadour and another Tripty scout that was in your general vicinity. After a long hard fought battle, you find yourself with a number of goblin bodies hanging around, and Prince Troubadour by your side, And you are back on Oloru.

What's your next step? I think our next step is to to see if there's, like, what kind of damage, if everyone's okay, if there are any more scragglers running around. Just kinda make sure this place is secure or secure as possible is what I see. Okay. Yep.

I that's fair. And where did they come from? Oh my gosh. We have Where did this crab come from while we were on the sea? They he he says they come in waves.

Sometimes there are only a few. This time, there were many. They have a crude boats over that direction. They have what? Crude boats.

Crude boats. Okay. Crude boats. Okay. One of the points towards the rear the the rear or the tail of Oloroo where there is a little bit of a, kind of like a stone staircase.

That's kind of what you guys, what you guys kind of it's what you guys walked up, when you were originally coming on, onboarding onto Uluru. Does he know where they come from? And these are the same goblins that keep attacking them over the past? These goblins do definitely have that red cracked, scorched earth, style skin, where there where there are red veins, where the, where the cracked earth would look would be. So these definitely look like they are firewalker tribe goblins.

Is that our next gentleman. Oh, that's a good question. Ultimately, that was our kind of next goal was to go hunt these things down. Yep. And try to kill the leader, make sure they don't harass us again, which will have a knock on effect of making sure they don't harass these guys again.

Right. But, yeah. So, yeah, ultimately, yes. Okay. So, anything about your yeah.

Prince Troubadour does, does say that or he he lets you guys know that Code Wind has yet to have returned. Not great. I would which is the brother. Yep. Yeah.

I would let him know, like, we'll find him by the way. What'd you say? Well Yep. I wonder if we'll find him on the way or if he's captured or something. We will.

As far as we know, he was headed the other direction, but he could have been captured. Right? Because he was coming the direction we came from because he was going after Troubadour, but the Goblin Camp is a separate Actually, do do I have that right, Chris? That is correct. Yep.

Okay. Okay. I mean, but to your point, he could have been captured and brought. Who knows? But Alright.

Is it possible he was turned into one of these bad people? Unlikely. At least not one of these bad people because these are, a different species than he would be. So as far as you know Do we have a kill him? No.

No. I I I would I would let you know if there was if if there was unless you killed some frog people. You you are in the clear. So k. And does it look like things are gonna settle for the moment?

Yes. Every everything is, like, as you finish off the goblins that are in your area, the you hear the sounds of battle sort of, like, die down outs, outside of the area as well. So it appears that the battle is done. Yeah. K.

I think we kinda get our stuff together, and I think we go follow kind of the direction where they're coming from. Yeah. Do we need to rest before we do that? That the spell caster asks, looking at his spells. Yeah.

Probably maybe one night. One night. To go with this. Probably down one second level spell. It would be helpful.

Not necessary for me. I will say that. Yeah. Okay. So there is, so just just a couple of reminders on kind of what you're what what you're facing there.

You totally can go after the goblins, and that's not a that's, you know, I'm I'm not telling you you can't, and it's not a good idea or anything. But when you were talking to, the chief, chief Krokmar Mhmm. He did specifically say that he's had scouting parties that have gone out to try to find the goblins, and they either never returned or they got confused and ended up going the opposite direction of where they were of where they were headed. So there's a little bit of some mystification sort of stuff happening. So if so it it is totally legit for you to for you to, you know, plunge into the forest and try and and try and follow the tracks, as well.

So I'm not saying don't don't do it, but I just wanna make sure that everybody remembers that part of it since it did well. Did not. So thank you. I think I did remember that, but I was like Superheroes. Yeah.

That's right. Yeah. You guys are demigods. What do you, you know, what do you care about? What are you worried about?

Is there any living could, like, force departure telling us to take him back to their lead in the scenario? There was a goblin that was left. Yeah. That was going to be questioned. That is a thing that was happening.

K. I thought I remember we kept one alive. So if you wanted to Did we capture him, or did we let him go? Oh, you already captured him. Yeah.

We captured him and turned him over to the Yeah. The frog people. Right. That they were gonna question him? So so if you if you wanna figure out what happened to him, probably talking to chief Croakmar would be your would be your best bet.

Okay. Seems like a great idea. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

I agree. While we're there talking to him, I also think it's a good idea, maybe get another read on how worried he is about his other son. Because I think we're all kind of down to go that direction if, Yeah. He start I think it's necessary. Right.

Mhmm. But last we talked to him, he didn't seem very concerned. Yes. Yeah. He did not, you said?

Correct. Correct. Yeah. It's a little weird to me. Yeah.

It's all good. His. Yeah. He he trusts his son. He trusts his son's ability to take care of himself.

Yep. He's the next chief. So Yep. So yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Let's, let's talk to the chief. K. So you head over to, chief Croakmar. He, he's as you as you approach him, he's basically cleaning off some goblin blood from a giant war hammer, or at least giant for him.

Giant for Awar. Maybe not giant for, maybe not giant for Cahir, but, and he sees you coming and says, oh, did you get in on the fun? A little at the end? Sure did. Oh, good.

I was I was concerned about the upper the upper left flank, but, apparently, my son and the four of you were able to help get us over the over the hump there. So what can what can I do for you? Well, we were curious if your people have been able to get any useful information out of that captive, the goblin. Yes. Well, yes, we were.

He was not very forthcoming at first, but after some time, we were able to get a feel for what he would, for what he could divulge. He appears to be under a under some sort of magic that prevents him from telling us exactly where his, exactly where his camp is, but, we were able to pick up a few elements. He mentioned something about red trees. He said once once we are once we are through the red trees, we will the the end is near at hand. Through the red trees.

Yes. As far as I know, we there aren't any red trees around here. But maybe we missed them. And we haven't seen any red trees, right? You guys have not.

No. He did also say that the, that the mistress must make the key. I don't know what this key is, but it seemed very important to him. It was something about sun something key. By the time he was talking about the key, he wasn't necessarily speaking as clearly as he could he could initially, but there's it was the sun something key that she, that his mistress is trying to make.

K. That's it. Okay. I don't find that helpful. Was it the It could be.

No. It wasn't the sun's it was the ember key. That's what he was talking. Ember key. K.

And let's see here. He said he said that the once the amber key was forged, then I then, his mistress would be the master of time. Like that. If that means anything to you. We have the temple of time.

Right? Don't look like that at all. Yeah. So if that's the key that he forges or figures out how to fix it That's what we got. Yeah.

Alright. Well, that's bad. I agree. Time to go find some red trees. I'm assuming that ember key doesn't mean anything to any of us.

Right, Chris? Which lords did you guys pick up again? I I don't think so. Yeah. I took the song.

Kingdoms to pass. Belt guard. I did number two. Lost kingdoms. Okay.

Yeah. So it it the the amber key sounds ominous, and you and, again, you know, given kinda what he said, you suspect it has something to do with the time turner. But, that's about all you know. Okay. And Okay.

Okay. We also noticed your, eldest has not returned yet. We're, starting to worry about him. Yeah. As as am I.

Before he was only a few a few days late from which people can be delayed, but we are pushing more on a week now. And that is something to be concerned about, especially with the dangers of the swamp. I'm concerned that he may not be alive anymore. But I can't given given our situation, as you just saw, I can't necessarily send out a search party after him as we are, as we find ourselves under siege on a more and more regular basis. And our we can't sacrifice our our brave, too many more of our braves to be able to, because we need to protect the village.

We need to protect the camp. Maybe we go out looking for him. I'm I'm very concerned for him. I I he he's he's never never this late. I pray that he is still alive.

Well, if I kinda look around everybody and we, well, our mission is time sensitive. We may be able to spare a couple of days to go search. He was, following the same path That's, that's Troubadour. Right? Yes.

He was he was tracking Troubadour, and with and when you say that, it almost seems like a shadow that was on his face just kind of starts to lift as he sees some hope, for for maybe somebody being able to do something about his son. He definitely it it was definitely one of those situations where he, he was caught between his position and his role as a father. He says, thank you so much. I I so appreciate your willingness to look for my boy. I think that he started down the path that Troubadour went, but, I suspect that he got diverted, because if he was tracking Troubadour all the way or no it was it's not Troubadour.

He knows, he calls him, was it riveting riveting word? Give me one second. He's actually using his real name. Right. Right.

He isn't on troubadour. Boguen. He initially was following Ogwyn, but he would have found him and you, if he was tracking him. So I would suspect that he started going down that path, but was diverted by something that was more important than checking on his little brother, which would imply something of, great importance. He is not a he's not a person that would just, abandon family.

So I would say that going in the path that you had been and looking for, potential areas where things are where he could have, gone off path, whether it's some sort of game trail or something else would be where to start. Alright. I said let's go. I think we will need to borrow one of your boats. Of course.

You are welcome to Where do we? You're welcome to any of our any of our canoes. So our is our subs still active? It is, but it is currently sitting it's it's currently sitting in the, in the Temple Of Cadence. Oh, that's right.

Right. No. Wait. Did you take that over here? Yes.

I thought I remembered something about, I don't remember. Something wonky happened after we got the artifacts with the temple. Yeah. So the temple raised to the surface. So it's now it's now above the it's now above the lake.

Right. Yep. Which, yeah. Maybe that's something we need to tell the chief too. I'm just gonna find out.

Building over there? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. So you're bound to see, you haven't already, but, there was a temple To Cadence at the bottom of this lake, that we investigated. That's now on the surface. It still may well be very started, but it's there. And I believe that's why, Oloru, chose this place, to help guard it.

Yep. Is that why we've been being targeted by the goblins, do you think? Most likely. Most likely. Oh, the journey is the journey is long.

Which for oh, yeah. He he says yeah. He says the journey is long. And but you whereas you Team are concerned because that temple's up that they're gonna get attacked more or is that his countenance that we pick up on? He doesn't seem concerned.

I believe it's more of a well, it's more of a state statement of, like, resolve. You know? The the turn of phrase of the journey is long is something that seems that seemed to roll out of his roll out of his mouth as if it was a common mantra that was that was that was said that he says, in considering that he, serves Ovara, the god of the hunt, who is about the hunt and not necessarily the the destination or the the quarry. It seems like that's just kind of something that, so he he he hears, he sees, he accepts kind of thing. It's kind of like one of those things where he's kinda been through a lot recently, and so he's just, like, accepting what's in front of him and, trusting that Olorun knows what he's doing.

So, yeah. I he yeah. He'll he'll Krokmar will say, I've if if the if our, if our destiny is to protect a sacred place of of the gods, then that is what we will do. I'm every level I I'm every bit I'm very confident that we will be able to see this see this, see this hunt end to the end. And Prince of Prince, Troubadour, but with it since he knows the area better.

Bhagwan, would you travel with this group? Bhagwan looks you all up and down, very scrutinizingly, appraisingly, and says, yes, father. These are honorable men. Go ahead. I need him to heal me.

Dictates that I must go with them. So prince Troubadour joins the party. Yay. Oh, yeah. So, as yeah.

And and, basically, while chief Croakmar, you know, kind of has this stoic air about him, like, after you guys have that conversation and you, you know, when you start moving away and everything, you do kinda catch that he kind of, like, moves as quickly as propriety would allow to the, to the upper left hand side of Uluru to take a look at the floating temple. So and he calls his he calls his wife and daughter to go and look at it with so Prince Troubadour looks at you and says, well, my friends, what do we do here? We head out on an adventure. I'm going off on an adventure. I think we should rest for one for one night.

Alright. Yeah. Are there any provisions or anything that you wish to wish to use or get, I guess? I would probably like to get some healing potions, just to have extra. How many healing potions do you guys currently have?

I have a couple. I don't know if I have any. I have what? You can What miner? Cast heal and so can troubadour.

Well, healing potions are still are still useful. Uh-huh. Right. They are they are non magic healing, which is nice. Yep.

Do they have a tracking dog that we could borrow? They do not have dogs here. Yep. Although that is a good thought. We have a tracking Prince Troubadour.

We have a Prince Troubadour. Why do you need why do you need a What are you guys to get a tracking to? Right? Or is that Jason's character? That's Jason's character.

Jason's character. That's why I was asking you. Excellent. This was this was supposed to be the Jason show here, and he it it the this is this is all on me. We just prepped for Jason to be able to do stuff, and here we are.

Quite right. As he looks, as he looks you guys over, he did give you an appraising stare. And he and, as Troubadour says, you guys might need a little help. And he specifically looks at specifically looks at Cahir and Karsten. And he asks you and he says, follow me.

And I follow. I will follow you. What little town is this, Chris? What was that? Sorry.

What little town is this? Oloroo. No. Sorry. What what level?

Oh, I'm sorry. No. You're fine. I had a mouthful dot for it. It was clear.

Not very clear. Well, you're you're kinda you're kinda coming in and out. So I'm only hearing like a portion of what you're saying. So Gotcha. But, the level of the town is level seven town.

Hopefully, I didn't give away the entire, I don't we don't have money for anything, really, you know, even level seven ish unless we sell our relics, which, you know, we're not gonna do. Yeah. But no one would buy. Fair enough. Talking about I got money?

Not like that, you know. Dang it. Why do I not have money then? No. You got money.

It's not like that. Well, then I need more money, Chris. I I'm giving you the appropriate amount of money for your level. I'm not I'm not holding out on you. I'm not being stingy like I was when I when I was running Star Wars way back in the day.

I promise. Fair enough. So we follow Bogwater? Yeah. You you follow Prince or Bogwin.

He makes you to, there's there is a there's a blacksmith in the in the area, who has a, is basically like the bellows is built into the shell of Uluru. The fire, you know, the the it's an open air black blacksmith shop as most of the as most of the, buildings on, on Uluru are. But inside there, is a forge. And inside that, we have, a very thick, trip key. This is like the most muscled frog man you've ever seen.

He looks almost as thick as, as Cahir. He looks over his shoulder and he says, ah, Baghwyn. What what why are you why are you here and who are these people? And Baghuen says, I have a feeling that these might need a, an upgrade, and he and he references your guys' weapons. Any waves at your guys' weapons.

The The, Trippke blacksmith looks at them and says, oh, yes. They do seem to be a bit underpowered. He goes he goes and starts rummaging through his through a chest that is next to the forge and starts pulling out what appear to be stones. He looks at these, throws it out, looks at another one, throws it out, looks at another one, throws it out. And he just continues that way until he gets to, a couple of a couple of things.

He's like, oh, yes. I think this one will do. And he pulls out he pulls out a stone and walks up to walks up to what's, walks up to Kyre, and he shows you a stone, and on the stone is a rune. He says, this will make your acts more fearsome. And he Yeah.

I get it. Asks, and he says, may may I see may I see it? And I would hand it over to him. Alright. Was he He takes your I like great men.

Squeeze it over this Yeah. And he even though he is a small creature, he lifts your ax with ease as if it were, as if it wasn't it it wasn't like this giant sized, giant sized, greataxe. Brings it over the forge and starts pounding on it. And then after a while, like, he heats up the metal on your on your blade, and then he starts pounding on the stone and then pounding on the pounding on the on the metal that is heated up. And then over time, that rune transfers onto your onto your axe.

And now you have a fearsome, You have a fearsome greataxe Oh. Which is pretty sweet. I will tell you what it does here in a second. Fearsome. There we go.

Alright. So what a fearsome weapon does, and just so just just for your guys' preference, like, as players, as you get as you gain in levels and your and your weapon becomes more powerful, you have the ability to transfer runes onto them, which are magical abilities, magical things. These are things that you can pick yourself, based off of, like, the the level of the item. Right? So right now, I'm giving some to you, but if you start looking at the archives of Nephis and you look at property runes for weapons and armor, you will be able you know, you can kind of see what additional powers and things you can get them get for them.

So, like, if you wanted to get the flaming property on your weapon, you you would do that through a rune and that kind of a thing. So, what the fearsome rune does is when you critically hit with this weapon, the target becomes frightened one. So, So, yeah, that's that's what you have on on your axe. Got it. Yay.

I mean, he he looks over at Carson. He looks over at Carson. Yep. That's me. And he praises you, and he says, alright.

I I think I have the measure of you. And he holds out his hand, and he had and takes your takes your weapon. And he will, and he transfers a rune onto your weapon Oh. As well. And you now your and winter's dawn now has a vitalizing rune on it.

And what a vitalizing a vitalizing weapon does is, vitalizing weapon pulses with vital energy dealing an extra one d six persistent vitality damage to undead. On a critical hit, the undead is also in feebled one until the end of your turn. Voice. Nice. Are you gonna put that on there?

Like, I don't have to remember that. I did. So it should already be there. And something to be noted about these runes is as you gain as you gain in levels, like, you can transfer runes off and put different runes on these. So just because the this is what you're starting with, doesn't mean that this is what you have to have.

Right? So you can switch out these runes if you want to. Okay. Do you probably would provide some sort of, like, armor rune for the for the spell casters as well. I just haven't I I haven't done I haven't done the work, but I you, Ramsey, if you wanna find a level five or a lower armor property rune, if you can even get a property rune on your armor right now.

I forget where they start happening. No. Armor armor doesn't have property runes at this level. This doesn't look like. There's a few of level five.

Okay. Alright. Oh, I can't get it on your shirt because you're not level five yet. Oh, that's true. I am not level five.

That is accurate. Yeah. But, yeah, we can but we can talk about that. Like, I Yeah. I I wanna make sure that everybody gets everybody gets a thing.

So Sure. Sure. We'll get some we'll get some magic armor on you so that or a a rune on your armor so that when you attain the level five, you know, like, you get you you you get that immediately. I'll work with Jason on that one as well for him. Yep.

Yep. But, yeah, first one first one is a freebie because I know that you guys aren't all familiar with kinda how magic weapons and things work. So I just figured I'd just hand one to you. And then if you and then if you wanna make changes to that in the future, then we can make those updates and that kind of stuff and that sort of thing. So Okay.

I would definitely honor the blacksmith. And I'd probably take my great axe, slice a piece of wood that he has there for heating up his forge and just show him how sharp he made it and probably just use one hand for that. Just like a little flick of the rest. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

He he is definitely impressed with your with with your, with your strength. He, you know, he's definitely, you definitely have his attention. Alright. Any anything else you guys want to purchase at this point? Or No.

Except for did you I don't know where to find the, like, little healing thing thingies. Like, potions? Yes. One second. Alright.

Sorry. Starting to get dark. Okay. So finally, finding potions and finding things, you just need to go to the, items section. It looks like little suitcase in the up in the, right hand inside the screen.

And then in there, there's a compendium browser button at the bottom. You click on that and click on equipment. Yes. Then what you're looking for is a consumable and Alcohol. Nice.

And it has the trait healing, and that should pull up all of your healing potions and antidotes and things. So oh, trait healing. Mhmm. Right. Antidote.

Elixir of life minor. Healing potion? Is that what I really want? Healing potion is and to the end, it starts with, like, the level one stuff, and then we'll go up from there. You can purchase anything up to level seven.

How do I know what level it is? If you look to the far right, there is a coin, then there's a hand, and then there's a number, and that number is the level. If you wanna purchase something, just click on the coins that are next to it, and that will and and you will purchase that item. Why is this stuff so expensive? In case you're not of the level to be buying it.

Uh-huh. You got You're only level four. Alright. So you're looking at level five, six, and seven stuff that's gonna be expensive for you. What are you all expensive?

I will take, I guess, some healing potions, minor ones. Because I think major major ones. Are $20. $50. Frick.

Alright. Just click on the gold, you said? Yeah. Click on the coins, and that will purchase. Yep.

And then keep doing that if I buy a couple. Oh, there we go. There. Done. We'll and we'll make it easy.

You know, it's I I'm not gonna I'm like, anything that is not, like, unique or rare, you can you can find here. So Now in my inventory, I only see one healing potion miner. Oh, there they are. Elixir of life miner. Okay.

Never mind. There they are. K. Looks like you're going. Yeah.

There's that. I am I am ready to go. 4348. Let's see. The wizard or the wonderful wizard of Oz.

That bag. Okay. 73. I don't think there was I don't have enough gold to get any I really want, which is fine. There's a lot of crap to buy.

Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. That's why it's good to limit yourself by level, really. Yes. Yes. Yes.

Yes. So oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Let's get to it. K. I am In the in the general channel, I'm also going to be posting links to the property runes, for both armor and for weapons. So if you guys wanna click on that link at some point and just kinda peruse through it, it's in archives of Memphis, but, I figure I'd give you a easy easy link to it. Wonderful.

Because this is how you get, like, your super fancy awesome magic weapons. So With runes? Runes. Magic runes, laddy. Yeah.

Not just the the weapon's magic. Right. Right. So this way, you can if you find a better magic thing, you could just move the broom. Yeah.

Right. So you're not finding, like, the ultimate magic weapon of level five, and then later on, you're finding another more ultimate weapon magic weapon of level 10. You know? It's kinda designed for you to have for you to kind of mix and match your your best weapons, so and armor too. Didn't really have to worry about this up until this point because nobody really had access to the runes.

So at least didn't have access to good runes. You could get a rune at level three, but it's pretty terrible. Yep. Yep. Yep.

So so it didn't really matter. Okay. So is everybody finished with their shopping? Yeah. I believe so.

Yep. K. Yes. I think so. Scott might not be.

I'm just looking at all the level seven stuff and things just to see Yeah. The level seven stuff is just there to tempt you. I don't think that you're gonna be able to afford much of that. But but when you're level seven, you will. Maybe.

Yeah. Oh, now I remember. I had a I had a third thing that I wanted to talk to you guys about. It's really quick, really simple, but, since, you know, you're currently level four, but when you get to level eight, that's when you're going to be if, like, as far as, like, the levels are concerned, this is that's when you're gonna be, like, a starting to hit, like, that top tier, power level sort of thing. So level eight is, like, when people could start building keeps or making make making magic schools, attracting followers, and that kind of stuff.

And so if, you know, so I just wanted to let you guys know that, like, about level eight, that's when you're gonna start being, like, somebody who's, like, important. And so if you wanted to think about, like, what sort of important you wanna be and have that worked out, and it may and then it'll make it easier for me to just kind of integrate it in, and that kind of thing. So Okay. Okay. We're not too far away from that.

Well, you're you're about you're about halfway there. So so it's a good time to start thinking about it. Okay. So you guys finish your shopping. You get you get your runes and everything attached.

And, and like I said, Ramsey, just let me know which which armor room you wanna you wanna pick up, and Perfect. We'll get that get that on there, for when you attain to level five. And then, we, and then you rest up for the night. So everybody go ahead and get some sleep. That should help out with some of the people who are currently enfeebled and clumsy.

Yeah. One would imagine. So for those of you who are trying to remember how to sleep, you go in the bottom left hand, like your character section, the bottom left hand corner. If you click on toggle effects Wait. Wait.

Wait. You click on extras, the boxes. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Click on rest for the night. That will do that for you. Boom.

No longer fatigued. I ate too. Okay. So we'll go ahead and remove the enfeebled. So because you did eat, you're no longer have have a super crazy metabolism.

Thank goodness. I was gonna eat. Alright. And so we'll go ahead and have Prince Chodor drop back down to where everybody else is at. And in the morning, Chief Procmar, Farella, and lady green, and lady green leaf, all see you off.

Lady Greenleaf gives you all, a token of her appreciation, which is, a my gosh. It's going to be an apothecary medicinal medicinal herb. Here we go. And I'm going to put it in it's, in the, chat. And she basically pulls out, she she pulls out, some fresh plants that she had freshly picked from her garden, and she gives each of you an apothecary's medicinal herb.

Mhmm. Medicinal herb. Excellent. So everybody pull one into your inventory. Pull one where?

Into your inventory. Well So just pull it on top of your character, and it should drop it in your inventory. Oh, okay. Why don't you just say that to start with? Because I expect you to be able to put two and two together and come up with four.

No. Still not. They don't do that. Oh, shoot. That's what I get.

I have a mouse that doesn't But she she passes you each one of these and says for your Yeah. For safety on your travels, may Uvara grant you grant you favor in your hunt. Yeah. It worked. Chief says, be safe and return soon.

And for Rella just has a look of concern on her face. Specifically, she looks at her other brother and looks at him straight straight in the eye and says, be safe, my brother. I don't know what I would do if something happened to both of you. And with that, you guys are moving back into the swamp. Oh, the swamp.

Alright. So does anybody have any survival? I do. Survival? Damn.

I'm trained. I'm trained. Plus I'm survival. Alright. Proficiency.

Stop that. We got I'm lost. We got somebody who's trained. That's Right. That sounds like that sounds like our lead tracker right there.

Where is survival? Core skills bottom left for me? No. I don't I don't can I see it? This is You're supposed to be an you're untrained plus two.

Oh, there it is. It's not even in order. It is. I got it. I suck at survival.

Even in order, but it is? Yeah. It doesn't seem like it was in order. That's okay. Alright.

So, so your your task is to is to one, is to one, find, code win. Two, if you can find some, find the goblins layer that would also be great. So you know How is Prince Troubadour at tracking? He does. Yes.

K. But Prince Troubadour is an NPC so he will lean on the PCs to be doing the heavy lifting. He's he's here to help. He's not here to take So it's still him in. Yep.

Pull him in when necessary. Yep. So Joe. Else do go down our path, but look for game trails and such? Yeah.

That was the general instruction that chief toadwin or chief Croakmar gave you was knowing his knowing his son, he would not have just kind of diverted himself. He would have been diverted by something. So either they either he was taken on the road by something, or there was something that was extremely important that diverted his attention from finding his brother. So either way, looking for a game trail is probably a good place to start. And we know what trail he would have started on?

Yeah. So why don't you go ahead and roll a survival for me or tracking? Are you Scott? Track. Yeah.

I believe so. So go ahead and roll a track. Is there such a thing as rolling a track? Yeah. Unless he's survival on my thing.

Are you looking at your character sheet? Or are I are you looking at the little part in the bottom? I was on my character sheet. Okay. So on your character sheet, just go ahead and roll serve roll a survival.

That's fine. I can pull up his hands and find tracking do. Yeah. So if you click on the little hand in the little in the lower left hand corner under the survival category, there's a track, and you can just pull that. Oh.

Okay. Sounds like a hero point. Yep. Sure. Feel free.

I mean, I have to. Right? You don't have to. You could see where a 12 leads you. Let's see where the 24 leads.

Alright. So, you start going down start going to retracing your steps. And you do make it through, I mean, the you make it through a few days. It took you it took you took you a while to get to here from where you were. You you make it you make it, well into your first day before you start seeing anything that might be kind of off track.

A majority of the bog land that you off that you offloaded on is covered by a boardwalk, and so there's not really a whole lot of, like, diversionary, things because you have just a bunch of boiling water at the bottom. So it's boardwalk or boiling water. You're not really going going into the boiling water. But you do eventually, at the end of the at the end of the day, you do see, that there are some, places where there where there are woods and are not woods, but, like, solid ground that are kind of off from the boardwalk itself. You don't see anything that specifically is looks like it was a looks like it was a that it was diverted from, like, somebody walked on it or anything like that, but these are areas that could be things that you were a that somebody would be able to move through.

So you're starting to get to more solid more solid land. Make it to the end of the day, you still haven't really caught much of anything, but it's starting to get dark. So should probably try and figure out where you're going to be staying for the night. Not survival. Not survival.

Scott's another survival role. Is it still a survival role? What's that? Well, I like, it The Well, honestly, we could we could just let Scott's other role kind of make that Okay. Good.

Feel the need to make you guys roll multiple survival checks throughout the whole time. So, we'll have the we'll have your other survival role stand. So you're able to find a place that is a suitable place to make to make camp. It's not directly on the road or on the boardwalk. It's a little bit further out, so that you're not necessarily gonna be approached by random creatures designed to designed to walk the boards walk the boardwalk at night.

You do throughout the day, you did see a number of different things that, you know, you either dodged out of dodged out of, dodged out of the way in time or, off in the distance. There are a number of creatures that you've seen throughout the day, being, undead creatures shuffling around or or giant, giant swamp creatures. You did actually also see the giant frog monster again. It seems to be meandering around in the, in the, western reaches of of the swamp. He was never close close to you, but given how enormous this creature is, it's head and shoulders above the trees, you're always you're always able to kinda keep tabs on on where it is at any given point.

And your instincts tell you that you do not want to be messing with that thing. Best to avoid it. Right. So you're betting down for the night. What, are you guys going to be wanting to set up any watches?

Or Most likely. My I would agree. Also going to use my wand of alarm, that picked up, previously, to cast alarm on the campsite. But, yes, even with that, what was our a good idea. That does seem pretty nice.

So okay. So you set up the you set up the alarm. How how are you guys wanting to split up your watches? I don't mind taking the first watch. Yeah.

And probably just three three watches. One each is Yeah. The best. Yeah. Okay.

Okay. So This this. Who wants to do who's second? Who's third? No.

I'll just take third. It doesn't matter, does it? Not really. Well second it is. Yeah.

It it as far as, like, game mechanics are concerned, it doesn't matter. But Yep. Okay. You might see different things on different watches. Alright.

So, Clark, why don't you go ahead and rule a perception for me? Okeydoke. I'm in a minute. I only have perception in this little Maybe? Maybe.

Yep. Is that a good one? Oh, you got a good one. Hey. What is a good one?

Alright. It's it's it's a good one. I don't know if I trust you on that, but okay. Yeah. I mean, if it's for us or good for hip.

Either way. Yeah. Right? Yeah. Either way, it's better to try.

So Yeah. Yeah. I just chose to interpret your question any way I saw fit. Uh-huh. Yeah.

I've really figured it out. Alright, Clark. So you you spend your you spend your watch waiting up and and keep an eye out, you do see a number of, undead creatures, but none of them actually get really really close to the camp. So, there were a couple of moments where there was a little bit of a, little bit of a concern because there was something that was getting close, but, it didn't didn't get close enough to cause any alarm. Your watch goes without without any any problem.

Oh. Scott, go ahead and roll your perception. Oh. Alright. I'm along like Jason.

Like Right. Oh, you eventually, you're gonna roll a load of numbers, Scott. I mean Okay. You're, you can't roll Go ahead and get your every time. But no.

No. Likewise, you, you know, you see a number of things throughout the night. There there are some, carnivorous plants that, are moving around in the vicinity. But again, they kinda get distracted by, they they kinda get get a whiff of some of the undead creatures that, Clark or that Carson saw earlier, and and they travel up after them. So you are in the clear as well.

Wow. Ramsey. Alright. Preception. Why was it I don't know.

Whatever. Alright. So our Mhmm. You see, you don't see anything that's coming after you guys. You found a pretty good spot to hold up, so you're not necessarily, getting tracked by anything.

But you do notice something I see. With, with Sameer, specifically. He, he kinda wakes up a little bit, and kinda grabs grabs his chest. After a few seconds, he pulls out the mirror that he pulled in the the thing, and you see something amazing happen. In that mirror, he it's a it's a travel mirror, so he opens up and he opens it up and he looks at it for a second, and then a flame erupts from it.

The the flame and, you know, he starts staring at it and, after, after a moment, you see, you you wouldn't normally see this, but, you know, just with your exceptional perception. You see in in in the flame, you see like a the look of a, of of a grove of red trees. It looks similar to where it looks similar to the swamp, but, like, it just has this red misty sort of, error about it. Okay. Also, inside that, you see a a young, Trippki wearing a feather headdress with clothing that has geometric pattern pattern stitch in them.

And he and he and it kind of branches out, kind of pans out, and he's hiding in a forest that doesn't look like this swamp. It looks like an actual forest in which there is a, in which there's a goblin camp in the distance. Then That's in the mirror? What's that? That's him looking in the mirror?

In the mirror. I thought you just said it was the mirror. Looking at the mirror. Okay. Yeah.

Progress. Then then the the flame changes again, and you see what looks to be the inside of a hut in which there's a giant cauldron in the middle that has a, a golden elixir inside. Oh. The and the flames are the flames are red hot, and you hear out of the shadows a crackling voice say, we need the blood of we need the blood of a prince to complete the key. Oh, okay.

And that pans over to where the voice is. And you see a old lady who is, whose skin looks to be ancient and glowing red eyes. She has a, she has a branched, a crown made out of twigs over her, what looks to be decaying flesh. And after a moment, she looks directly at you, or she looks directly at the at at you, and the flame disappears. Excellent.

Alright. Cool. Cool. Cool. No.

No. No. No. No. Oh, where's the red trace?

Dang it. And you and and you and Samir share a look. Yeah. Yeah. Both, that same thing.

Yep. Clark, we're sleeping. What I know. Why was this happening? Like, is this still, like, dark dark?

This is, this was at the at the, at the beginning of dawn like, as as dawn is is cresting, you know, or, you know, as dawn is coming, it's not like full sunlight, but it's getting there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Middle of the night. But based on where the sun was rising Mhmm. And I, of course, am I able to determine which action those images were? Yeah, actually.

You are very certain that those images are happening to the West. Excellent. Excellent. Kind of in the same general direction of the big frog creature that you've been avoiding. Oh, yeah.

Yeah. Cool. Good. Good. Good.

Oh, great. The one we definitely don't wanna tango with? Yes. The the one that you definitely don't wanna tango with, like, for real. Right.

Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. You don't wanna touch that.

Well, alright. I, very nervously spread the through my watch. I think everybody get everybody up and let them know what's what. Yeah. Samir's Samir's like, apparently, on top of whatever else we can do.

Kinda what's a c thing? Revealed, where we're headed is that way. Point toward where baby the giant frog is, you know, that's a guy at the moment. Saw red trees and mist. And then, and then we saw your brother playing a turbanor.

He's right there by the goblin camp. And it just so happens that the hags hag? Hag. Needs royal blood to finish that key. That's what they were talking about.

So, yeah. Quick breakfast. No second breakfast today. We're in the kitchen. No.

Sadly. Or 11 seas. Nope. Nope. Excellent.

Excellent. Right. So Prince so Prince Troubadour, upon being surprised by the news about, like, all the things, he also does, like, let you guys know. And he was like, well, we never really thought to look over there. I mean, that's a good reason not to one big reason not to.

Right. So we'll have to be careful. How's your guys' stealth? Oh, pretty good. What do you mean stealth?

Probably everyone else's. Stealth. I'm guessing. Oh, stealth. Yeah.

Mhmm. I I mean, you already know how good Prince Troubadour is at stealthing. He's pretty good. Right? No.

No. No. He he was he was actively hiding from you. Yes. He was actively hiding here.

He's he's he's very, very bad. He thought he was doing great, but, you know Yeah. Yeah. So he might have actually been doing great. So alright.

So you guys do your yeah. You you guys do your do your breakfasts as quick as you can. Get get packed up and ready to go and start moving towards the giant frog. Stealthily. I like it.

And, like, we'll we'll go ahead and fast forward a little bit because it takes it takes you guys a a bit of time to get there. So we're looking at, you you have about, another, couple of days of travel to actually get to where that giant frog is, Or about where that giant frog is. And something that you do notice as you start proceeding as you as you get to the end of the second day, is there is more of a more of a red mist that starts floating around. The trees themselves start turning from have, like, this murky green into more of a more of a blood red sort of, sort of color. The water itself looks like it might be it might be made of blood or at the very least, it might have, a a red bed to it.

This area seems as you as you get further and further into it, I'm gonna need everybody to make some will saves. Oh, I got some will, buddy. That's not it. I go forward it. Not a a will.

There we go. Oh, we're good. Where did you do that? Ah, I'm definitely rerolling that. The will save, if you're looking at your little character thing in the bottom right hand corner, it's the, it's the brain button.

So if you just click the brain button, that'll get you your will save. Yeah. Oh, nice. Nice. Nice.

Nice. Or the little brain, not the brain button, but it is a button. This doesn't look like button. Okay. So each of you as you start walking in there, you find yourself getting slightly confused about, like, where you are or what's happening.

And you find yourself starting to turn around, but you at the last minute, you catch yourself, and you're like, why am I why am I heading the opposite direction? I know I was going this way. And you turn yourself back around and proceed forward into into the mist. Over time, you get through, you get to the end of the day there, and you do find and you are still in this you're still in this sort of, like, weird area. It's very unsettling.

It feels like, you know, you might lose track of where you are at any given point. Do you wish to stop for the night, or do you wanna press through the e through the night to see if you can get through, the rest of the rest of this, this terrain? Good question. Or do you want an option c? I don't know.

You might have an option c, but I mean, I think we keep kinda pushing through. Yes? Hello? On one hand speaking? On one hand.

I don't know. It's both bad. There's no good option. Like, if we don't sleep, we'll be tired. Right.

But if we do sleep, who knows what crazy stuff works on the right best? I think, you know, big frog we already know. Yeah. We Here's the thing we should try to get some rest. I don't know.

Same. Both both options seem not great. Okay. But, we can. What did the captured dude say about the red trees?

What's what's their their close? Yeah. Yeah. That was about a like, it wasn't that far. Right.

Right. I think, probably, push through, but I I don't know. Either way, you ain't good. Can't be too far away then, hopefully. And he made it.

Right. Yeah. I mean, time's been a thing. So on top of who knows what we're gonna face, so we stay here. Yeah.

I'm thinking push through. I hope I hope. Yeah. Alright. Okay.

So you guys push through. You you spend, you spend a a good amount of a good amount of the evening, just following through basically, you know, doing your best to get through the get through the get through the red misted area. And you do find yourself where you are approaching what looks to be like you're still in that red area, but at the other side, of this land mass, like, you're you get to the end of boardwalk and you're looking and there's a there's a land mass that you can walk onto. There are other trees and things on it. But on the other side of the land mass, you see, like, the mist appears to be kind of dissipating.

So you feel like you are, approaching the end. And this is about, it's about four in the morning. But you you're still able to you're still able to see it. And You are so, it is the middle of the night. What is your, are are you using the light spell, or are you going are you going blind?

Like, how what's what's your light situation here? I mean, if it's the light spell, everyone knows we're here. Right? Yeah. But we can't see working it up post.

Yeah. There are a few of you that do have dark vision or low light vision. Oh, that's right. But, Got that. The human the human and the gnome, unfortunately, do not.

So Do not. Wow. Yep. So what I an option, that I can do, I think. Let me remember myself how the Pathfinder two e white spell works.

Space. Attach light to a creature. Stain the spell. Attach it from a creature. Crap.

A whelp. Okay. I mean, if the light spell helps us, why don't we just, I guess, use the light spell? Yeah. I was trying to see if there was a trickier way to do it.

I mean, I guess yeah. I mean, it does only right? Like, it's only 40 total feet of light, like, 20 feet of bright light and then 20 feet of dim light. So it's not like we're announcing presence to, like, the whole world forever. Right.

But, still, it's it's something. But, yeah, I think if we're gonna keep traveling, we're gonna need it. Sooner or we stop, and I think I'd rather not stop. Okay. So I just, something that I just discovered, and I think this works across the board.

But if you target one of your allies and cast the light spell, it will automatically apply it to them. Right. Right. Or or yourself. Like, I didn't know it actually I didn't know that actually worked.

Okay. Okay. Yeah. I was, what I was checking on is the the you could cast light on object but that does not appear to be the Right. Pathfinder.

That is either an area or a creature. Mhmm. Yeah. But I can cast out an area, but that's not really helpful. So my thought was I can cast it out an arrow and keep shooting it ahead of us, but I can't do that.

So that ended up. Yeah. Unfortunately, not. Yep. So, So yeah.

So I guess who's going to be the subject of your light spell, Ramsey? Are you going to just drop it on yourself? Or I mean, we can't do any or all of us. Right. So maybe I don't know.

If we're all sticking together, maybe all of us or maybe I could drop it on me. Yeah. 12. It's gonna be hard to speak. Get my lit up.

Hey? Yeah. I guess I'll just put it on b, for now. K. And then if I do have to extinguish it, it's like on one of us.

K. And like and like I said, I mean, at least the the only people that really need to worry too much about it is, is you and Carsten. The rest of the group has, low light vision. So, basically, what that means for the rest of you is anything that isn't lit at this point is is black and white. So you can see in black and white, but, further out than the the space of the light.

So you guys, you guys get onto that land, and then there's another boardwalk. You start moving towards that. And go ahead and roll some perception checks. More perception, More perception. More better.

Boop. There we go. That's how you do it. K. Alright.

So, Kahir, you noticed this specifically. With your low light vision and your high roll, you definitely notice as you are approaching the, the, the boardwalk to get onto the next section of land and just beyond that peninsula that you're about to get onto, is kind of where the mist kind of, not if it it dissipates. I was about to say evaporates, but that's the incorrect word. Dissipates is the word I was looking for. But you see that there are a number of creatures that are moving in in the trees and the bushes and in different areas, on that peninsula, do you suspect that there's some sort of ambush in place?

What do you do? Out where you get the don't Then out where you get to the light guy. Well, you can you can you don't need to necessarily worry about the or are you moving away from the light? No. I was just joking.

Go ahead. Okay. I I was just gonna say, you don't you'd like you actually can see things pretty clearly. It's just black and white. And our you see motion, but you don't know where it is.

Like, it's it's out of the it's out of the radius of the light, of the light spell that you have, but you definitely know that, you know, there's something out there. Okay. I would stick out my arm like they do in the military and be, like, hold. Yep. Go down to one knee maybe.

And then, like, probably tell our and this is I don't even know if this is possible. Can you just extinguish the light spell? Yeah. I'll I'll turn it off. I won't be able to see.

Yeah. But we're close to these people. Right, Chris, you said? Off in the distance. They the Isn't too far.

They're about the like, they're really close. Like, you can you can see things moving, that are about 40 feet out from you. Oh, actually, I would they they're I would just say they're out there. I don't know that we need to extinguish the light. But Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Also, not thinking. We, Chris, correct if I'm wrong, but we know that goblets have dark vision.

Alright? We've encountered these things in dark areas and they seem to be able to see? Yes. Okay. Then, yeah, I definitely don't extinguish the light because that's not gonna help us at all.

Yeah. Right. They could see us they could see us without that No matter what. Okay. Yeah.

Let me let me turn that back real quick if that is all the same to you. I am still offended by you by you doing that. No. It's fine. Right.

Right. Also, it's nice to be able to see, and I don't imagine that you could. Yeah. Yeah. Alright.

Cool. Sick. Awesome. So what are we what are we big one here. Do we get a little bit of time?

Or are we So what so what what I'm gonna say is you have about a round to figure out what you're going to do because they're waiting in ambush. But if but when when you, like, kinda stopped in your tracks Yeah. They they'll they're gonna catch on real quick that you know something's up. So, so I'll give you a a round before I'll give you three actions to spend before we roll initiative. And then at that point, you're rolling initiative and we're jumping into Yep.

Jumping into a fight or having a fight two weeks from now because it is post tentacle. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yeah.

Sick. Alright. I cast light on Karsten. Yeah. He probably got it.

He's probably running ahead of me. Yep. That that seems likely. And then I am going to, drop into, my strategist stance. Yeah.

However, I do that. Says it's an action. I'm figuring that out, but, yeah, that's what I do. Okay. Let's see.

There it is. Oh, you found it. Okay. I think so. Alright.

And we're gonna give we're gonna give Sameer the the same stuff when when we pick up next time with Jason too. But in the meantime, Clark, do does Carson have any immediate reaction? Like, you've got three actions that you can spend at this point. What are you gonna be doing? Yeah.

I'm just gonna be prepping and ready to slice and dice. Okay. Put your shield up? Yep. Got my shield up.

Okay. So you raise shield. I think there's an action to do that. Yep. I do need to make a lore deck versus standard DC of my level.

So it's 24. Level base d c for level four is 19. So that is a success. Okay. Okay.

Because when we go to strategy stance, that matters. K. So, Mark, you raise shield. Just we've got that. Do you have anything else that you wanna do?

You have two actions after that. Nope. Okay. So you just raise your shield. You've got your weapon out, and you're ready to go.

Yep. Alright. How does well, heal yourself. I I only have myself two points, so it's just kinda silly. Oh, you guys actually probably are at full at this point.

I mean, this has been, like, three or four days. So Yeah. Okay. I'll also No. I think I'm worried if I Question.

Yeah. I don't know if you had the chance to modify the marshals aura with that 60 foot from my shiny relic or not. I did. But it's irrelevant. Okay.

Sick. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.

I yeah. I I I just went to your Marshall's aura and updated the the aura to be 60 feet rev and trying to get something else to increase the Yep. Yep. Okay. Sick.

Programming is stupid. So Yep. Yep. Yep. Awesome.

So Yeah. It's a yep. That cool. Alright. Awesome.

So our, cast light on Karsten then drops into his, drops into his martial stance or, strategist stance. Karsten raises his shield, has his has his weapons out, and he's ready to go. And, Cahir, likewise, pulls out his giant axe, and he's and he's getting good to go. Prince Troubadour, I think, is going to follow suit, with, with Karsten, and he is going to raise his shield as well. Maybe.

Yeah. Yeah. He did raise his shield. Okay. Cool.

And he's pulls out his pulls out his hand, add z, and he is ready to go as well. So this is where we'll call it for tonight. We'll start off the next session with this battle. Not gonna have anybody roll initiative just now because I figured we'll have Jason here and we'll get him get his initial reaction next time. But That's on the fifteenth?

That should be on yeah. It should be on the fifteenth. Yep. Will I be here? I will not be here.

You won't be here on the fifteenth? I will not be here on the fifteenth. But that is okay. Yeah. I'm looking at my I'm looking at my calendar, and there might be I might not I I might have some some problems with the fifteenth as well.

But, maybe You having a conflict is a much bigger deal than me having a conflict. That's fair. I I will I I let's let's pencil in the fifteenth if if if I can if I can make it work. I don't know if anybody else is, any Like, Ramsey, are you there on the fourteenth? Are you out that whole week, Ramsey?

Oh, I am that whole week. Well, maybe, technically, the fourteenth would work. I'm not a 100%. It it's certainly a much better shot on the fifteenth. I am just straight up out of town on the fifteenth and the fourteenth.

I think Yeah. I could make work. Pretty sure. Yeah. I'm around So on the fourteenth as well.

Yep. The fourteenth a Monday? Yep. Yeah. It's a Monday.

It's a Monday. Yep. Oh, I think I have a couple clients on that day. Okay. So good the week before and the week after, it looks.

But, yeah, the the fifteenth is is bad. Absolutely. That'll be Fort Wayne. Oh, the fourteenth. I currently am good with the fourteenth.

Yeah. Maybe we can do the fourteenth. Just, just for everybody's knowledge here, like, I'm it's the I I'm I have to I I have to actually go into East Lansing on Tuesdays now. So, this is the first Tuesday that we've had Pathfinder that I've done it, and I didn't actually get home until 06:00. So it's kinda one of those things where, we'll kinda see how it goes, but Tuesdays might be a little bit more difficult for me just just because, like, you know, I mean, I'm sure you guys know.

You're at home. You wanna spend some time with with your wife before, you know, before if if, you know, if you're gonna be able to do that. And so, like, I basically spent the whole day. I was out I woke up, went to work, got home, had dinner, jumped on here. So, so we'll see.

But I know that Tuesday generally works best for most people. So if I gotta suck it up, I'll I'll suck it up. But I'm flexible. Yeah. I'm pretty open to most, most weekdays.

But, yeah, let's let's go ahead and pencil in the fourteenth. If that doesn't work for you, Ramsey, then, if that turns out to not work for you, just just let us know, as soon as you do. Otherwise, if we and if that week ends up just kind of falling through for whatever reason, like, we've got we've got some family friends that are that are gonna be in the area, that week, which is why I'm like, I don't know. So, if that falls through for whatever reason, our next session after that is the twenty ninth. So, it could be another month, but, you know, that seems to be kind of what summer does.

So people, like, have stuff that they do during the summer. So Yeah. Oh, no pressure. Yep. Oh, yeah.

I'm gonna go to the Cool. Alright. Can I get you? Good night. Sleep well.

Thank you. We'll catch you guys later. Alright. See you. Thanks for having me.

Yep. Bye.
