Alright. So just to remind everybody where we are, we are currently in a what appears to be an underground fort inside a cavern. The party, has just defeated a group of goblins and a large green wart covered woman of some kind. Upon closer inspection of the goblins, you did discover that these goblins have, are different than the ones that you've been facing up until this point. These ones have green skin like the other goblins, but they also have a red, a red design on their skin as well.

Almost like, you know, when mud when mud dries up super fast and it's got those cracks in those crevices, kind of flaky flaky sort of, layer on top and it's got the the deep cracks in them in the center of it. That's kind of what the that's kind of what their skin looks like. Only the cracks themselves are not cracks, they're just a design on their skin, and those cracks are the color red. So they've got kind of like this green skin with a little with like, a red, with a red webbing sort of design on on it. Not very noticeable.

It's not like it's not like, you know, all up in your face. It's not noticeable until you actually start, like, you know, looking through the bodies and you're like, oh, this is this is kind of odd. They, you all found a number of different things, amongst the bodies, not the least of which are a spacious pouch, a belt of good health, and a cape of justice. And all and I think all three of those things are accounted for at the moment. The last one you said cape or the other is on on me?

How do I find that? The cape is actually our the belt of good health is the one that you have and you do have it equipped. And that'll go into Oh, there I found it. Yep. Almost amazing.

Okay. Yep. So with regard to the goblin peeps Uh-huh. Are are we still supposed to be on the landing page or the world map? Or did you You are still supposed to be on the landing page.

I'm just giving you back Okay. Okay. Just sorry. I I'm I'm doing my the red red marks, goblinoid fellows, don't happen to be in any sort of particular arrangement that might somewhat, resemble like a shuriken? Good question.

No. Okay. That is a good question, but but no. The these these designs that or you're you're asking about the the lines and designs. Right?

In the yeah. Like, the you're describing the goblins having these kinda, like, fissures in their skin that have red that kind of inquiring if there's a specific pattern to them. No. Yeah. No.

There there's no specific pattern. This doesn't appear to be anything like a a tattoo, or anything like that. It just appears to be just kinda like their natural skin. The rest of it. If you, yeah, if you do want to roll a society, to identify what tribe of goblins these are, you're welcome to do so.

Although it will be a very difficult test. So, these are definitely not local, the the these definitely aren't like goblins that are that have been in the local area that that you guys will be familiar with. But you can always make the rule. I don't think I even have that as an option. You probably have zero like I do.

Yeah. It's a solid Okay. So, Chris, we haven't been at this town for, like, more than a year, have we? Been here for about you have, it's been a year and a half. Okay.

Because, like, even the people that are at the town are a conglomerate of survivors. Right? But you're saying we wouldn't have even interacted with this type of goblin before Correct. The fiery death of everyone else. So Yes.

The flaming retribution. Yes. The flaming retribution. Fiery or fiery death. Well, they could be from the time stone.

I just been watching a lot of Marvel. Oh, yeah. Time stone. Sometimes I have a flaming retribution. No.

Too much buffalo sense. Well, that's right. Have near killed them. Yeah. It's called the norovirus, apparently.

Okay. So, also, the as you guys have been taking as you guys have been taking everything in, a few of you did look out of some arrow slit holes that are in the back of the room itself, and you found a, you saw I'll just pull you into this. You saw that in the back. Yeah. That's right.

In the back. Yep. And this is you do recognize this to be part of the burned wood, which is supposedly a two week travel from your, from your current, location, like your the location of the town. Oh. And that is where we are.

So I'll go ahead and pull you back back into the Goblin Tunnels, and you guys can make your, make your plans. Alright. Have we got the end of the line? I think so. We've been everywhere now.

Go to. Sure. Looks like it. We can exit down here. We want to go into whatever that wood is where we can head back to town.

But Part of me would like to go back to town just because of all the craziness. And if there is need for us to support the town, then we can do that. Yeah. They were being attacked as well. Did you say they were or weren't?

Oh, they were. They were goblins in town. So yeah. I I I agree. Were we headed to the Burned Wood, and then we got sucked back to this with my brother and the two sentinels or whatever?

We were headed north. Thought we were headed north. You you guys were headed to the Bird Birdwood to deal with goblins. Oh, we were? Yep.

Oh, I missed that. I'm sorry. Never mind. But I agree it would be good to regroup and assess. I don't know if we need to do anything before we go, though.

Do we need to, like, close the can we, like, blow up the entrance so they can't get down here anymore? Well, I don't know if we can do that, but we just killed a whole bunch of people. Remember, there's the entrance. I mean, they could dig around it. But if you can remember, if we go back out the way we came, there's an entrance from all of these little tunnels and from the caverns into where that, spy hourglass is.

So we could technically figure out how to blow up or cave in that section right before. Does that make sense? So you could block it off there. Yeah. What I was wondering if the source is coming from the burned wood, is there some way to put, like, a spell on it so that when we know that they're coming down this thing or something or, like, you get what I'm saying?

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Fill this back if they fill this back up, we might have to do it all over again with the little goblins. Oh, that might be good for experience sake. Back, let me tell you. Again.

Right? Yeah. I I hear what you're saying. Sorry. I am in agreement with with Anderson.

I don't know of anything off the top of my head, as far as a a way of accomplishing that, but I I don't I don't know that I want to disable or destroy the passage. I think it would be better to be able to to monitor. I think we we have to consider the fact that somehow in, how long have we been down here? Yeah. I was gonna say I don't know.

A couple a couple of hours? You know, maybe eight eight, ten hours? That might be clarification from mister Chris. You guys as far as you can tell, we've been been down here for about four, maybe five hours. Oh, okay.

Perfect. Yeah. I wasn't sure. I'm like, well, technically, it could be, like, we've been down here for, I mean, days or something compared to the rest of the world. Who knows?

Right. Could we we've gotta consider that there's something goofy going on because we managed to go in what our perception would be four hours, two weeks worth of travel, so something super cycle is going on there. Yep. Right? So, you know, like, I would partially wonder if, I don't know.

I guess I don't I would like to see if we can actually get back to town via the tunnels, I guess. Yeah. Not sure. Sorry. We don't wanna take a long way back.

Yeah. I'm that's right. Let's not do that. At least not this time. Right.

I mean, or we just keep going, forget about the people, and see what's there in the burnt forest. But I don't really like that. These are our people. Yeah. I agree.

Well, we can check out the town. Our original goal was to go down there and try to find and eliminate the product at source. We could still do that, and if we want to seal the tunnel, maybe after we use it would be better. If that's still a plan, we can go through, blow it up on the other side or whatever, tape it in. So we can go back to the town, but we're on the other side of it.

We cut that two weeks out. However, I don't know if that's still our plan. Right? Right. Because there was this stuff, and I have a scroll or a book or I don't remember what it is, but something that was talking about some other I I would have to remind you to read through it.

There was something else somewhere else. Some mountain or Yeah. Something. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

The mountain range. So I'm not entirely certain the goblins are, the biggest worry at the moment. And the other thing too is we found some of that glass. We didn't find a ton of it. And do we repair part of the hourglass with it?

We need to find more of that glass, that special glass. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that we have the materials, but we don't have the knowledge, the ritual to do it from what I recall.

Right. I'm trying to see. I thought I had something, but Are you talking about the Spires Of Cuthelar? Yeah. That place.

Yeah. Home to the betrayer. Yeah. See, that doesn't sound warm and cuddly to me. I will have to agree with Ramsey on that.

I don't I don't speak a cat. I mean, cats are warm and cuddly, plus they also are big players. So Cure a dog ear. That's true. No.

I I agree. Let's let's head back to town. And maybe the, what's his name? The the the town leader, may have some yes. May have some some good advice or direction as well.

Also, we wanted to see there was something we didn't know. There was something we found that was in a language none of us could read. We wanted to see if we could track that down too. It's all coming back to me, kind of, like, 10%. You have a long jog back.

Yeah. Not two weeks worth at least. That's true. It's probably only an hour's worth of walking to be legit. We fought our way the entire way.

I know. Was. So I'm tired. You know, I need a bath because I stink. Well, I wasn't gonna say anything.

But And I need a massage. So all of those things need to happen. And, like, flames have been licking you up and down for, like, the last three hours, dude. I should need a massage. Well, I'm telling you, I need a massage.

Alright. So it sounds like you the group is heading back to the village. We're heading due back. Yeah. I think so.

Okay. That sounds good. Are you going to be taking the, the most direct route back? Are you going to be going by the by the exits, on your way out, or are you just trying to hightail it back to the village as quickly as possible? I think at this juncture, the idea is to get back to the village as quickly as possible.

Considering that so far as we knew, they were still under attack. Correct. Right? Yeah. That's fair.

Okay. So the quickest route is to go back through the fort, go back go through the, treasure room, and then basically just kinda, head up the lakeshore and right back out right back out there. The total time that takes you get get all the way out all the way back, is, pretty much pretty much about a half hour, maybe forty five minutes. Mhmm. Hey.

Real quick, out of game question. I mean, is that I don't remember this when we played. Is that a typical dungeon crawl kind of, encounters? There's a lot of encounters. Yeah.

The this is a typical dungeon. So Okay. The idea is you move from combat encounter to combat encounter to puzzle to, to combat encounter. I didn't put in I didn't put I I did put in puzzles. I did put in puzzles.

You guys just you you guys just kinda skipped them, for the most part. I think you got maybe one of my puzzles. Yeah. Because we I'm terrible at puzzles, just so you know. Not that you didn't know that already, or is it recorded, but I'm terrible.

I I I did know that, but I do also know that there are other people in in the group that actually enjoy doing stuff like that. So I do try to include things for them for that too. I I appreciate that, and I'm okay with that. I just not my strategy. No.

Absolutely. But the, the overall, but yeah. So, basically, the idea of a the idea of a dungeon is revealing small pieces of things throughout the dungeon that paint together that put together a full picture of what's happening. Yeah. Makes sense.

I think so. It's moving from yeah. It's moving from clue to clue to clue to clue kind of thing. Makes sense. Alright.

So, along those lines, you make it back out. Are the guards still there that was kinda protecting everything? Yes. And I'm gonna go ahead and Oh, that's impressive. You guys killed a lot of goblins.

Oh, mom. You did. Sure did. So many goblins. Do you have statistics on on how many we killed?

I'd be interested to know. It yeah. I see a lot more. They're all dead. They're all dead.

Those were all the goblins that you guys killed. I'm pretty sure there were close to, like, 15 goblins that you guys got through. And that's not typically a, that's not typically a a, an encounter. Most most encounters, you don't deal with, like, bad guys. I enjoyed the goblin.

I thought it was great. So So you guys made you guys made it back to the bridge. Within the bridge, you, you have, you see gold and two and the two, solar sentinels that you left behind, on the bridge. Basically, just kind of holding, holding the ground holding ground, making sure that, nothing gets by them. When you walk through the door, called calls out, brother, is that you?

We are here. He can see that we're here. Nice to meet you. Time. I was beginning to worry.

It had been a while. Did we ask how long it's been for him? Yeah. How long is a while? I think it's been about it's been about six hours since the attack started.

Okay. Cool. That's good to know. A long time. I mean, when you're standing there waiting.

If I I have instructions from Jared to, get you guys back up there as soon as you arrive. So, they'll get on up there. Oh, red team go. Now you get up there upstairs. Oh.

So you guys head back up to the is there a way of moving or clicking on this thing where I don't trigger the, character sheet every time? It depends. What thing are you talking about? My guy. Every time I click my guy, it pops up a whole quick time.

And I'm trying to move him, it's it pops up its character sheet, and I don't really care for that. You that shouldn't be a thing that's happening. Unless you double click of it. Yeah. I mean, I might be, but I didn't think so.

But okay. That that helps. So I'll try to look at it. Yeah. If you if you are double clicking it, that will totally open your character sheet.

Okay. Well, then stop double clicking then. Okay. Okay. So you guys make it back up, make it back up top.

Once you make it into the actual village itself, you see that the village is, is recovering. They're no longer under attack. The, there is, a pile of goblin bodies, outside of the outside of the town, as well as a number of, settlers, bodies, whether they're solar sentinels and or just town folk, that happen, that are being laid to rest. There there aren't there aren't that many. There are only, like, four or five, but each each, each member of the community is is a hard is a hard hit.

You see the solar sentinels basically doing the preparations for, for burial for the four or five, members of the community. And, there's a there's a a lot of activity happening, in the village itself. There are some people who are, out on the ramparts, re reassuring them and a number of different people running around, tending to the wounded and, doing what they can to make sure that everybody is okay. What do you do? I would like to go find oh, shoot.

Jared Jared Mhmm. And kinda check-in. And then if we're not needed somewhere immediately, I would attend the help wherever we needed help within the city, whether that's carry bodies or help people that's wounded or heal them. Oh, shoot. I can't do that.

No. I can because I'm a paladin. But I check-in with Jared. Alright. Do we wanna look at the bodies of the goblins real quick as we pass to see if they match up with the ones that we were fighting?

I mean, I would say yes. Okay. Quick look. Yeah. So you're gonna even look reddish?

Or bluish or bluish. Yeah. So you look you look at the goblin bodies. These ones are just, the the common variety of goblin. Mhmm.

So different than what we were fighting? Right. The same as well, the majority of the ones we fought were normal. Right? Mhmm.

Just some of the other Right. Right. No. You're you're right. That that is that is accurate.

Okay. They seem to move a little faster. Ever so slightly. Yeah. They're red after all.

I watch all of the purple ones. Very sneaky. Anyway Okay. So basically, you guys are, as you're, as you're moving, you're you move towards the the temple where Jared, usually keeps himself. I say temple, but it's really kind of more of a glorified tent.

In the past year, year and a half, the intention of creating a place of worship has been, has been there, but, there was always something else that was more pressing. So you make it to the tent, and you do hear Jared's voice coming from inside the tent, giving instructions on how to care for some of the wounded and providing, a scroll of, a scroll that has an antidote for, goblin pox, a truly deadly disease. You enter the you you enter the temple, and Jared looks up and says, oh, Awir, Gald, not Gald, Cahir, Sameer, and Karsten. I'm glad that you made it back alive. That's true.

Mhmm. Too, A little dicey there, Karsten. Cross go. Yeah. Well, about it was it it did not look good for us.

But about, two and a half, three hours ago, the goblins just broke broke rank and and ran. Not sure exactly what happened, but, they just seem to have lost the will to fight, from which I'm not complaining. They were getting ready to overrun the overrun the town. That'd be about the same time that one of those drow kicked the bucket. It it actually would be doing some quick mental math for the group, it would be about, the time that you, successfully, paused that the that elven skull to, crumble.

The one that was basically whispering sweet nothings about the, the great time turner, turning back time. I'll turn something. You should have a share video right now. Perfect. Perfect timing.

So what what did you discover in the tunnels? We find a whole lot of goblins. A ton of goblins. There were some, dark skinned elves. I've never seen anything like that before.

They seem to be kind of leading them, I think. And these. And, I don't know why I have them or someone else has them, but, you know, we've definitely found some, like, texts, especially when we couldn't read being the important one. Yes. He takes he takes them, and starts leafing through them.

He goes through the journal, first, and looks at the torn map piece, and then looks at the, the scroll that you or the impression that you did of the of the word of the words in blood on the wall. Mhmm. And it says, now these I don't recognize. Well, I I do recognize, but I cannot read them. The, the first of these languages is quite obviously goblin.

Never bothered learning that tongue. The second, I know only from my religious readings. It is infernal. What is infernal? In the language of demons.

Oh. Can I say that one up, Paul, Christian? No. I I I didn't catch what you said, Jason. Oh, I just asked Carson if he had hadn't studied that one up.

Oh. I mean, to answer your question, he should have. So the answer is he should have. I was just confirming Right. I knew what it was, and I should have said, should Carson know this?

And the answer is yes. I would hope so. And if not, then there's a deficiency in my teachers. Math teachers. Math teachers.

Well, this most of them are probably dead. Well, that's probably true too. Oh, man. So can he decipher anything from that? He he does he does not know either of those languages, but he knows what they are.

So, unfortunately, he direct of someone who may be able to. Mhmm. The and he points in the direction of the burning woods. Oh, okay. Well, good.

Okay. The the goblins would know. Well now What's the truth? Let's go torture one. You would say that, Barbarian.

We can go talk with, with the betrayer. I'm I'm sorry. Who? The betrayer. We need to find the betrayer.

I Do you know that name? Know that you want what you say that you want. I'm sure I don't. Have you have you not heard the the have you not heard the, the legend of the betrayer? No.

Wait. Time out. Can I roll to figure out if I have heard that? We we read some of it and understand some of it from the goblins stuff. So the full legend, probably not, but their version, yeah.

Alright. I'm not sure exactly how much you know about this, but, let me give you at least some, Background. Background here. Yeah. So, Vorath, also known as the betrayer, he makes some sort of religious symbol when he says the actual name, was once a mighty king of the blessed realm.

He was chosen by Rhathilion to, to be his chosen tool. I'm sure that you've heard of the La Palu, and then he makes another religious symbol. It was originally thought that the La Palu were, and every time he does that, he makes that same religious symbol. It was once believed that they were, the, messengers of Raythellian. They were here to help the world, in times when, in times of when the most dire circumstances were were present.

But he and his partners, Maldron and Sirith were proof that that was not the case. He originally started out as a great king and diplomat of of the blessed realm. But over time, he became more and more, he became more and more ambitious. He got to the point where he did not believe that, any anything or anyone should, not live underneath his domain. As he became more, more convinced of this, he got more cruel in his tactics, seeking to break the nations that he so that he wanted to conquer, all against the, the belief of the, all against the teachings of Raythellian.

The blessed Rome was there to be a big brother, to look out for the nations, to make sure that they had the support that they needed to thrive. And he took that mandate and, made it into a mandate for, what's the word? A a mandate of tyranny. Over time, he was exposed. The there were a number of people of the blessed Rome that followed him, did thought that he was correct in his thinking, and there was a rebellion that that, that happened.

And in that rebellion, he and his, two generals were slain. What were the generals' names again? Sirith the Shadowed and, Maldran the Deceiver. Oh. Since that day, the, there were two orders of knights that were created, from the ashes of what was once the golden age of the blessed realm.

They were the sentinels of equilibrium and the order of the dawn guard. Both of those knightly orders were, created specifically to find and destroy any member any La Palu that may exist, within the blessed realm and beyond it. They had too much power, to be able to manipulate the blessed realm the way that they did and that power could not go unchecked. But Vorath, the betrayer specifically, he is a he is a tale of, tale of warning to those who wish to achieve their own ends by any means necessary. He was doing what he felt was right, what was good, and he did not care about the ramifications of how he did that.

And in so doing, he invoked Erebos, the dark deity, and channeled his energy rather than the light of Raythellian. What became of him? He died thousand years ago. What, what was it we we saw that spoke of him? I don't remember.

Was it in the text or was it the skull? There were a couple of things. So there was the skull mentioned was mentioning him as part of the incantation that was trying to worm its way into your brain. Yeah. There was also a there was also a there was a statue of him that was labeled him Yeah.

Okay. As if he were it was like a, a a Galloid elf. Yeah. But the the statue itself was was more of a, shrine sort of thing Mhmm. As if to a deity.

Yeah. And there was also a journal, written by an explorer that was talking about, where Vorath was sleeping, as well as the as well as the Elven skull was talking about awakening the betrayer. Yeah. Okay. Cool.

Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.

Cool except not. Well, on that note found down in those tunnels, it looked like these goblins or their leaders were revering this guy as a deity, and it sounded like they believed he was coming back. Mentioned something about the, what were those, that spire called again, Sameer? Yeah. The spires of Kuth Alar.

Yeah. Yeah. Those ones. I thought he was sleeping there. Yeah.

Cuthilar. Assuming that's a reference to the grave. Now that I do know. Cuthilar is a region, or at least it was a region. I don't know what it is anymore.

But it was a region to the west. There was there was the the Great Lake on the edge of the mountains, that separated us from the separated us from the separated us from Luminal, the the nation of the elves. See an apostle who we know here. That region, Cuvelar was that was the mountain range on the on the far bank of the great, of the Great Lake. Spire Of Cuvalar, I imagine would be the highest point of that range, but, I've never heard it referred to in that way.

So, It actually does make sense, although it is somewhat disconcerting. That region was a gift to Borath prior to his fall, the elves for, a peace treaty. It was given directly to him, not specifically to the blessed realm. If if my memory and my history lessons prevail, we are talking about things that happened over a thousand years ago. Okay.

Okay. Yeah. We're really jacked out. Well, last old naps. And doesn't show much of what Maybe most important.

Sorry? No. I was just saying that we got old naps of things that we don't don't have good bearings for. Right. Yeah.

What were you saying? Oh, I'm just saying the the last thing and maybe the most important right now, those tunnels down there, we walked for all of, what, an hour, maybe? And, on the other side, we ended up in the Burnt Woods, two weeks away. I don't know if that's from the temple of time being down there or something else, but that's how the goblins were able to, make those assaults on us so quickly. Now that is interesting.

Oh, is there some sort of is that some sort of teleportation circle? Like a permanent teleportation circle, do you think? Maybe? I fear I don't know, quite enough about the arcane dance or that, but I guess it's possible. I mean, I've never never heard of a I've I've heard of a teleportation circle.

I've heard of teleportation, but I've not heard of something that just is that way. It must be it must be the effects of, it must be the effects of the, of the temple that's causing that to happen. If that's the case, partially my concern is is how did the goblins or how did those weird other creatures I don't know if they're a drow or the black elves. How did they know that that would lead us this way? Does that make sense?

Like, so quickly. Yeah. How did That is a the best. That that is a very good question. I there must be something or someone that is extremely powerful that is directing their efforts.

There's you said there were nothing but goblins down there in the dark elves? There was, Some undead. Yeah. Yep. Some some undead.

There was, some elven graveyard we found that looked like it had been desecrated. And there was, I forget if we identified the hags or not, but if not, I'll just describe them. Yep. Right. I believe that you did actually identify that they were in that they were indeed hags.

Okay. Yeah. There was, there's a couple of hags down there as well that also seem to be leading them of a of a sort. Again Two two eggs? Yes.

Yep. Two? Yeah. Little short of a coven. I suspect there's more.

Stop talking about, oh, man. It was like your mama joke. Now here, here's here's here's mom again. Yeah. Oh.

Okay. So when you when you describe the hags, you describe the the dark elves, you describe the goblins and the undead. He looks more and more and more confused as you as you go through the different layers of creatures that were in that tunnel. He's like, none of these things are known to be allies to each other. There must be something that's forcing them together.

That's what we were thinking. Well, the last bit of the puzzle maybe, when you describe the time that the goblins broke and ran, it was about the time we found and destroyed, something? This skull that was doing some kind of incantation? I don't know. My memory of that event is kinda fuzzy because Ramsay wasn't here.

Yep. So Oh, that's cool. That's why I described that better. Ramsey wasn't here for the one puzzle that you guys triggered. That was that was terrible.

Like, I put puzzles in there for you, and then the only puzzle that showed up where it was on your day off. Right. Right. That was terrible. That's a fact.

That's funny. Not. So whatever that thing was, it seems like it was controlling them, linking them, maybe? I don't know. Somehow it seems like it's controlling them.

I mean, that was the tunnel didn't run. But Until, like, you could feel it. Once you heard it, you could Yeah. Feel it trying to press its incantation into your mind and overrun your thoughts with it. So, now I don't remember, much more than doing a, like, a detect magic on it.

But it it was certainly some sort of telekinetic telepathic, like, it it had a link there. And so, yeah, it it made sense that when that broke, so did the the link. Right. Who was controlling that? I'm not sure.

I would have to guess it was one of those elves, those black elves Mhmm. That we saw or found. That would be that'd be the only thing within the tunnels that that seems like it could have maybe set that up or made that happen. There's a couple of those that are pretty, our key works. But Yeah.

Well, if your if if your if your friend's statement about the hags are correct, then it's possible that they were able to create that. Hags are extremely powerful spell casters, especially when they come in groups. So that is also likely. Although, elves are very magical as well. Nothing nothing to, nothing doing for that.

What is I would offset or offloading with the, the hag thing, though, is we dealt with the hags, and the incantation resisted. Oh, they're they're your final battle was with a hag. Oh, Yeah. That's true. So Yeah.

It was the goblin plus the bugbear plus the Yes. Plus the hag as well. But also, you know, like, I mean, Tamir's process is not incorrect either. Dark elves are known some things that you could do that would persist. Yeah.

You said it. And, yeah, and dark elves are pretty well known for their evil magics as well. Something something that, all all of you guys after kinda talking about kind of the elf the elf skull that that you guys defeated, the routing of the of the goblins, you do remember that there that there were a couple of goblins that after you destroyed the elf skull, you saw running out of the cavern. Not a few. You know?

Oh, yeah. They did run it. I Yeah. I do remember that now. Yeah.

Yeah. Well, I think we fought after that were the the dark elves, the hag, the bugbear. Yeah. The the mem The chest. Gauntlets.

Yeah. There was a a chest on there. We fought that thing too. That was weird. Yes.

That was. I'm proud of that. Never seen a chest with teeth before. Right. I've only I've only ever heard legends of those.

Well, that's really legendary. Well, I think I think the question is it's clear these things are being led by some larger, more powerful force. It's clear they want the temple. It's clear that they're worshiping the betrayer. I I think we might have bought ourselves some time clearing out that tunnel and destroying that skull, but I don't think we solved it.

I think they'll be back. Yes. And that and that con and that leads me to my next request of of you four. You have all proven yourself, as true allies to a a vote on or or a a town. Yeah.

I like it. So I would ask, one additional boom. We are strong enough to be able to hold, for whatever these goblins decide to throw at us next. But we need to figure out what's going on, where they're coming from, what what they're doing. So I would ask that you four make a, make a, make a crack team to find the source of this goblin invasion?

I think it might be in the burning woods, but, that may just be the that may only just be the beginning. Would you hate us in this way, help protect our people and protect the what is left of the blessed realm? This, this place, its people, you, you've you've become home to me. You took me in. Of course.

I'm in. And I said I would die to defend it, so I am in as well. This is the best thing I got. Holy shit. What do you got?

Alright. You have my axe. You've been you've been waiting for that one, haven't you? The whole the whole game, you've been waiting for it. And my loot.

Oh my god. Perfect. I love it. I love it. A crack team, We kinda look around.

Yeah. I like that. Risking our lives for the good of the realm. Certainly much better than those dastardly La Paloo. Right?

Geez. Garston is very much chuckling, and very much enjoying his friends and the humor and banter. He says, I will yes. I was hoping for this. We we need more we need more good good good hearted folk like yourself.

I and if if my, and if my ears do not deceive me, I fear that or not fear. I feel that I must too go into the tunnels to help lay these, poor the these poor elves back to rest. Will you accompany me there? Of course. I don't know that we're ready to set out just yet, but we will we will be with you now.

Yes. Yes. Yep. So yeah. So with that, he and, a few of his acolytes, come with him.

And you guys as an honor guard, come alongside as well as a couple a couple more solar sentinels. You go down into the tunnels, and he performs some last rites on all of the, on all of the desecrated corpses. He then, you know, has the has the solar sentinels that were in the, that were in the temple move up into the actual tunnels themselves. They set up a they set up a a a new guard post in that area. As you guys walk as you guys to go to where the exit is, you actually notice something that you hadn't noticed before.

The first time, you you only saw out of one of the exits of the, of the tunnel, and that pointed towards the, burned woods. Mhmm. The second exit to the south opened up into a boardwalk on a bog Oh. That does not look familiar to you at all. Ah.

Oh, hey. Before, before we're going down into the tunnels and stuff, there's some, you know I don't know how I would like a few minutes in town to do a few things. Oh, you've yeah. That's not a problem. I'm I'm Okay.

I'm basically just giving you additional information, and the solar sentinels have moved into the tunnels to basically make sure that no big bad nasties make it into the tunnels, keeping it protected. Yeah. Yeah. We're not, like, leaving right now. It's just throwing, Jared around.

Yep. Yep. That's not weird, Jeff's monster. And yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Alright. So and and as you guys and as and as you're walking around, Jared makes a few comments around, this feels there's something to do with the with time and space in this in this cavern.

It's more than just the temple. I believe that this is an extension of the temple. Very odd. Interesting. Alright.

Well, you guys do have, time to do things in the town if you would like to. I just wanted to get to the party stash. If you go to the little the the actors tab in the well, there are actually two ways of doing it. Right now, you're if you go to the landing page, that's the simplest way to do it. Let's go to the landing page, and in there there's a party.

Yeah. Click on party. I was I was there, and then I was on the world map, so I I lost that. Yep. Without going.

So yeah. So I think that there's a back button in the upper right hand corner. This should be a little o shape thing with the back arrow. Okay. On the right side of the screen, you're saying?

Left side. Sorry. Upper left hand corner. Mhmm. What?

That's not right. If you click on that, that will just take you back to the previous screen. Hey. I'm there. Okay.

Okay. Okay. I guess maybe it is. So what's up what's up, Ramsey? I was looking at my sheet, and I'm like, how do I have that much gold worth of equipment?

But that keep of justice is apparently a 100 gold all on its own. Mhmm. It's true. Bongers. Anyway, I think if I'm understanding it right, what's in the stash when I'm in the party, right, is all the stuff that we have collectively, like, not put on ourselves personally.

Right. Is is that stuff ours, is it really available, or is it just like, hey. It was we didn't take it with us. It's it's gone. Everything that's in the party stash is something that you have available to you at this this particular moment.

However, once you actually go adventuring, you no longer have access to those things. Sure. Okay. Okay. Okay.

So It's effectively your it's effectively your your guild bank for those of you familiar with the concept. Okay. Sounds great. You wanna spell off some of this bulk stuff. Now would be the time.

Chris, what level town is this? Good question. So those are a few years, like, Yeah. Some of that's, like, the vaccine we should hang on to probably. Yeah.

There's a few things that would be okay, I guess, to sell off. Some of it, I'm like, hey. We like, we have collected some of this stuff that we really don't have a use for. Mhmm. I would be happy if this is stuff that we've gone out adventuring and we've we've snagged.

Some of it, I would be happy to, use to better outfit the military presence if if it's not you know what I mean? Yeah. No. That makes sense. So if if we can make some money on it, I guess, great.

But that wasn't my goal. My goal was to, like, hey. How can we help the community Mhmm. Better prepare itself? Sure.

Well, I have a chain shirt that I can give, and I got other stuff I'd like to sell. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, like, there are hundreds of arrows, that Yes. I have I have more than enough for myself probably.

But, like, okay, let's put those in the military Yep. You know, bolt for those. We've got, eight leather armors. Mhmm. Maybe we sell off six of them or something.

Yeah. I think we can use to help at the town. I'm down. Yeah. I'm good with that too.

The armors are probably goblin sized, though. I'm not sure how much good they're going to be. Oh. Yeah. Yeah.

Oh, they're gonna melt it down and The the chain shirt will not be. So Okay. The chain yeah. The chain mail, I think, is something that's worth. That was a person size.

The leather armor, you're right. That may have been that may not have been something that would be fittable for people. Yeah. Anyway, that was just kind of my thought. Mhmm.

It'd be great. We've got dozens and almost a dozen dog slicers. Like, those are reasonably effective, but I don't I don't know that I want those running around anymore, and I'd rather just, like you say, melt them down and make something useful out of them. Right. So anything that's anything that's specifically like goblin make is going to be a really terrible quality.

Yeah. Exactly. They so anything that's specifically of Goblin make, you're probably better suited to, melt it down to its raw materials and you can start over. Now anything that's Elven make, like, that stuff is pretty good. It and Mhmm.

Yep. How do I sell my chain shirt? Yeah. So I don't really have, the settlement stuff worked out just yet. So we are we are just going to have everything that you sell is going to come out as at 50% of its total value.

So we'll just call that call that good. And then delete it and then tell you? Yeah. Just delete it and then add and then add the add the coin value to either to your party stash or your individual Oh, that person. I can do that.

And then what if I wanna Were the short bows were were those goblin weapons or are those useful? The the short bows are goblin weapons, but they aren't in the same category as, like, a dog slicer. A dog slicer is basically a is basically a flimsy piece of metal that's chipped and and and nasty and barely holding itself together. The short bows actually could be could be used, I I would say. Okay.

So even though it's on a goblin, it's not specifically goblin weaponry. And I understand that. So that's Right. What is the exchange rate for silver? 10.

3 gold. Yep. Under 1. 10 silver to 1 gold. Oh, okay.

So we Is everything by degrees of 10? Yep. Yep. So 10 gold is all done. Right.

It's copper to silver, silver to coal, gold to platinum. Okay. So one the only thing I can sell is that chain mail. Everything else I need. So Mhmm.

Just FYI. Everything else is all inventory stuff. Are you are you in the party stash, Clark, or are you in your personal No. I'm in my own staff. I don't know where the party staff is.

I know you said it. Oh, right there. Never mind. I think I found it. There we go.

I got it. Alright. Pew. Yep. So I don't know what you how people are doing that.

Oh. Okay. Why does it say I have 206 gold? Because you're filthy, stinking rich. We are, but OR has 300.

Is that just from our party staff? No. That's total, like, equipment value. Oh, wait. I like I don't That includes your full plate.

That includes your special weapon. That includes all all the things that all all the things that are in your in your inventory. Yep. That's not including the stuff in this party inventory. Right?

Right. Okay. How how do we, like, I don't see a way to increase or decrease the quantity of for instance, our top line item there is spears, weapons and shields. We have spears. Mhmm.

We've got four of them. Uh-huh. And I I don't see a way to change that. Get rid of one, etcetera. You don't have a plus or minus next to the on either side of the four?

No. Okay. Maybe that's just something that I've got. Kinda go on in the header there. Yeah.

Well, I mean, you guys if if you want, like, I can just I can just handle whatever it is you wanna sell here. Perfect. So if you're going for the spears, that's two silver pieces for all four spears. Mhmm. Dog slicers.

I was gonna say hold on to those because, Kihir and I can melt those down and and craft something out of that. Yes. I can't believe a long bow is worth 18 oh, $18 or is that all of them together? It's all six of them. Oh, that's kinda cool.

Alright. So, like, $3.03 gold a piece. Not pretty good. Right. Town people want that.

Yeah. Okay. I thought the short bows would be good to get, you know, a hand off to the military. Yeah. Okay.

Is is anybody able to use the hand cross bow? I can. I think, but I won't. I like the short bow better. Okay.

Yeah. The hand crossbow is I mean, anybody can use it. It's a simple weapon. Right. But who would?

Okay. So you're donating the short bows. Right? Is that alright? Everybody's okay donating 11 gold worth of short bows?

They're gonna be used. Yes. That sounds good. Yeah. Absolutely.

Okay. Outfit in the town sounds like good use to me. Yep. Hand crossbows, the crossbow, the repair, and the steel shield. I don't need any of those.

Yep. I agree. K. Alright. I'm not keeping track of of money on any of that because I think we're just donating all that.

Yeah. Yeah. We're you're basically giving this up to the town guard. Are you gonna be doing that with the leather armor and the chain mail as well? Yeah.

If they really need it, and I don't know that. But if you're like, yeah. They could use it, then because you're the GM, then that's good for me. Well, I I would say any any military equipment that you can that you can pass off to them, they will happily use. So Sounds good.

Yeah. Yep. That sounds good. What we've got left in here is Torches, musical instrument. That might be good to keep.

We'll leave all that. They got the They got the rules. There, I would say, the arrows and the bolts, we can probably get rid of. Yeah. For the townspeople.

I agree. K. Ramsey, do you have enough arrows? Good question. I have I'm gonna take some of them.

I will take 10 of them. I would say take as many as you need. Yeah. Pretty much, I can't carry a whole lot. And I don't use a ton of them.

So Okay. Ten ten will I have will be plenty for now. I'm sure we'll find more on our way. Okay. We'll do that.

I'll go and get rid of them. For some reason, I have some of those too I can give you, Ramsey, because I don't have a bow. That's funny. You're plucked out. Just picking stuff up.

Alright. So we also have these consumables here. We've got the wolf's fang, the soothing scents, the effervescent ampulli, the minor vaccine, the battering snare, any of those if you wanna if you want to have access to them in the next part of your adventure, you'll wanna make sure that you pick those up. Okay. Definitely getting these soothing scents.

I have and use the suit spell, so that seems good. I won't drink those. Someone should take that vaccine because it sounds like something that could be useful to have. Maybe. I don't want anything in there.

So let me look. I don't take the vaccine. I don't care. I think I'm overencumbered. So Well, if if you're overencumbered, start handing things off to Karsten.

He's got a bag of holding. Mhmm. Are you gonna stay? I would He's officially the mule now. If, if I can are there if there are some some other elves in town There are.

I would hit them up and see if they would be willing to purchase the couple of elven curved blades that I've got. And I don't know what their value is, but I would whatever is It's like a thousand gold pieces. No. It's like 4. So, you know Oh, you're no fun.

2 gold each each, you know, if it's if it's four solid for, like, two. Right. Because, sounds good to me. Else trained in acrobatics? I may be.

I would be surprised if you're trained in acrobatics, Clark. Seriously? I I am. No. Okay.

There's this, the effervescent I am trained oh, athletics. Oh, I am trained in acrobatics. Told you. I'm sick. This, effervescent ampule is probably good to take with us.

Three of us could use it, and it'll let one of us walk across water if we ever need to, which seems useful. That'd be amazing. Seems like it could've been useful at the lake, but I don't know if we had it better or not. Take it up, Clark. What one is it?

Effervescent ampuller, however you pronounce that. I don't I don't see it. Oh, there it is. Never mind. I see it.

Okay. I know. I've already got quite a bit of the lethargy poison. I don't know if I'm gonna need more. If anyone else wants some or we can just get rid of it.

It's poison. It slows people. I'm not gonna either. Hit with it. I have some too.

I've only got four more. I'm gonna say we keep it. We just save it. I think we may as well. Right?

Yeah. Okay. I'll hang on to it or you can if you've got some here. I've got two. Yeah.

The the left the left of the g position just just for those of you who are like, oh, we'll keep it forever. It does have a set d c of eight it's an eight it's a fortitude. It's a d c 18 fortitude check. So, in a few levels, that'll be I don't know what Well, let's spell it obsolete. If we don't need our Yeah.

Yeah. I mean, I've got seven on me right now. So Yeah. Yeah. I guess I could lose it.

What. So And there's no and and to be, you know, to be fair, there's also no harm in just holding on to it for now. It's just knowing that eventually, you're probably just gonna be offloading some of that stuff. Okay. Yeah.

So, does anybody else have, grappling hook and rope in their stash or no? Yeah. I should have rope. Yep. Well, maybe.

I thought I did. I have I have a climbing kit. Yeah. I have soap? So do I.

No. I've I've got rope too. No. No. No hook, though.

I have I have a torch. Oh, Jason, it looks like you're pretty well unencumbered at this point. Yeah. Yeah. I just thought there's no sense in four of us running around with a grappling hook and rope.

What Yeah. That's true. Throw it throw it in the, you know, I don't know, the oh, shoot. Bag of holding because I can't think of the other name. I got one.

The I got a spacious pouch is what it is what it's called here. Yeah. How do I how do I go about doing that? Do I Clark, do I just have you add a grappling hook and rope to your, well, you should be able to drag and drop it onto his character sheet. So you just have to have your character sheet.

You want yours in our tool? Yeah. I'm just saying, I'll, you know, throw it in in yours as well, and then if we got it, if we need it, we can pull it out of your bag of holding or spacious, whatever. That sounds fine. So I just dropped those onto you.

So You did? Oh, there they are. So pop those in your spacious bag and you're Right. Black hole interstellar travel. Also, something's something that people probably want to keep an eye on here is your treasure.

If you have things that are worth money, then you can basically just exchange those for money. So, like, Sameer, it looks like you've got an alabaster and obsidian game set for 10 gold. We got a piece of amber that's worth 5 gold. You can just cash those in for 15 gold. What what was the amber in that?

I mean, like, what was that about? Those were those were just random treasure. Yeah. You remember back in back when we were playing three D and D three five and you'd and you'd defeat a, defeat a, a Snorlack and all of a sudden a piece of art would pop out of its butt, same principle applies here. Interesting.

Yeah. Just a different way being able to get money. So, anyway, if I were to cash those out, then I just hit this sell button. Yeah. Just need sure.

Why not? Yeah. Interesting. Okay. Clean's out.

Alright. Alright. So we have sold a bunch of stuff. As far as, like, if if you want to purchase things Yeah. We are looking at At what?

We have a new potty. There's that too. You can pick up anything that is of your level and common or uncommon rarity. Where do I find that? If you go to your if you if you go to your inventory, you'll see a little next to any of the elements in there, you'll see a little magnifying glass.

Click on that. It'll open up. It can it'll open up the compendium browser. And then from there, you basically, you know, go to there's a rarity filter on the left. Click on that.

I don't see the little hourglass. It's not an hourglass, it's a magnifying glass. You So it has to be in your character sheet. She You can't you can't click on the quick access thing there. Alright.

Well, that helps. Winter gone. Add an item. Nope. Hi.

Not add an item to search item or Oh, I've got it. Yeah. Okay. Adding an item is just gonna add a random it's just gonna add a blank item to your sheet, which does nothing. Oh, I don't want you Now Once you roll into the compendium browser Yep.

To the to the left, there's a rarities filter. Expand that. Click on common and uncommon. Common. Uncommon.

And then what? And then also go go down to the very bottom. There's a levels section. Level four. And go and the top level is three.

Boo. Clark. Does it automatically update? Yeah. Yeah.

It automatically updates. And so and you can basically in the inventory types section, you can switch to whatever type of equipment you're looking for. If you're looking for, like, healing potions or something like that, those would be under consumables, equipment, shields, weapons, and treasure. But none of none of the weapons are none of the weapons are going to be oh, you might have a magic weapon in there. But yeah.

So feel free to go through, go through that and pick stuff up if you, if you want. And at least in an effort to make it so that we're not spending the rest of the night here, staring at making making a shopping spree. I will say spend your money any way you see fit out, after after the session or between sessions, and we you will have retroactively purchased it at this point. Yep. Yep.

Okay. So I mean, we get a few more minutes of playtime before it's before it's go time. Okay. Alright. Anything else you guys wanna do?

Nope. I'm also probably gonna pick up some potions or something. I can do that. Oh, for sure. At some point, we need to take a nap.

Oh, yeah. That's I need my massage. We have been up for a long time. Well, not terribly long. It's been about an eight hour day.

I don't know what the problem is. Yeah. It's just that it started at, like, 02:00 with a really hard run. Touche. Touche.

Alright. So we will go ahead and, if you want to have rested, then if you go over to your, little HUD thing, you click on the boxes, little stack of boxes, the extras thing extras tab. Inside there, there's an option for rest for the night. Click it. I click it.

Sorry, Chris. I missed that. One more time. Oh, I oh, wake up. I'm all rested.

I'm not there either. Face thing. So so in the bottom in the bottom left hand corner where your all your character stuff is Mhmm. There's a little icon of, like, Hubert boxes. If you hover over it, it's it's extras.

It's right next to the skills tab. So it's little boxes next to the hand. Yep. Rest for the night. Rest for the night.

Yeah. We did it. I have this, Marshall's aura. Yep. I have tried to shut off, like, three times.

Well, you're not gonna be able to. Oh, that's that's that's emanating from me. Oh, okay. Comment. Okay.

Okay. Just checking. Remember where it was from. Yep. Well, I mean, technically, nothing nothing's happened with it so far.

It's just just been there. But, eventually, it'll start doing things. For our world, we'll start doing things. Okay. Okay.

Okay. Why do I have a religious wooden symbol? Because you picked it up. Seems unnecessary. Yep.

You picked it up from the, it was the Drow priestess. Ah, okay. Thank you. That will go to Jared Okay. For, you know, more investativeness if that helps him understand anything and gives us any more insight.

So Alright. I would He will happily in the course of our conversation. Hey. I snagged this off one of those dark elves. Yep.

Clark, it looks like you have not taken a nap yet. I have not. I'm sorry. I've been trying to find my weapons, but there's nothing really I really need. We're we're pretty good.

Okay. What do I do? How do I sleep again? So there are boxes that are right next to the skill hand in the lower left hand corner. It's extras.

Click on that, and there's a rest for the night button. Ex oh, I'm sleeping. I can earn an income. I need to hire myself out. Oh, when you've got downtime, you can do that.

That's what I'm saying. I could be a tour guide. Oh, is that what you were going for? Yeah. Okay.

Professional tour guide. Alright. So you guys you guys get your shopping done the the day before you, you then go to your respective homes, and have a nice restful night's rest, before the next day, or for the next day. You wake up in the morning well well rested, and you, what do you do? Are you meeting?

What are you what what's happening? Good question. Do we wanna go go cut. Let's say, do we wanna go check-in with Jared and then see if there's any immediate needs and then head down through the cavern and go to the If you do check-in with Jared, there are no immediate needs. He encourages you on your way though.

Mhmm. Yeah. I mean, do we go to the Burnt Woods? Or there was another weird bog. We didn't know what that was.

I mean, I assume the Jared's got guys guarding the tunnels, so it's not like anything's gonna come through behind us. But Right. We probably start in the the woods. Yeah. I agree.

But that bog is kinda curious. Yep. I agree. Especially Going into dark woods. Less than Going in going into the burned woods, is that the consensus I'm hearing?

Sure. Yeah. We need to do anything with the the glass that we found. Probably not sure if it was The crystal? Yeah.

You you I mean, you can keep it in your party's stash. There's nothing you can do with it right now. It's it it will be useful in the future when you are able to actually mend the, the time turner. But you currently do not have all the tools you need to do that. Okay.

Perfect. That's all I wanted to know. Okay. So you head into the burned wood. Yes.

We're at the wood burning. So you you walk into the you walk through the the portal, or the cave mouth and are instantly taken to Sorry. Deep deep into the burn wood. This is not the northern edge. This is actually pretty heavily inside.

You are surrounded by, charged trees as one would think if they were inside a bird would. The, the air itself is full of embers that are floating around. This wood wooded area has been, has been in this state for, past a year, maybe even a full year and a half. It seems like it's freshly burned, but it's been in this state for that entire time. Alright.

So, you walk out there aren't there there's no, there's a little bit of a beaten path from from the exit of the, of the cave mouth. But after a short amount of time, the tracks themselves become harder to follow and you find yourself in a situation where you are if you're specifically going for goblins, you will probably need to do some tracking, perform some tracking rules. So that would be a survival test. And if any of you are quick trackers, that would probably be the person to do that with. Well, happily, I'll happily do some tracking.

Alright. Nothing special about it. Right? Nothing special. Oh, I rolled a nine.

Modifies to a 17. Okay. Not a total of higher than average. It's not a bad roll. Not a bad roll at all.

So you continue, you you continue down. You are able to find, what look to be goblin tracks. A little bit harder to find just because there's a lot of soot and and and that sort of thing, and it's constantly covering over the tracks. So while if the goblins were there in the past, like, couple hours, you'd probably be able to pick them up pretty readily. The the tracks actually self self cover or cover themselves after after you would estimate to be about three or four hours.

But over time, you are able to kind of you are able to navigate through that section through that section. And, you do start to see, more more obvious evidence of goblins, in the wood. The the the the smell of the goblins, the stank as it were, is starting to overpower even the stench of burned wood that that has sailed your nostrils for the past two or three hours as you've been tracking them down. I think we're nearing a village. You you definitely think that, for sure.

Now, you also notice as you're as you're traveling, it appears that you aren't the only thing that is tracking these tracks. You see some pretty large, imprints of like spikes that are in the ground, that have a bit of a skittering, pattern to them. Samir, could you please roll a nature? You don't have one. I have some You do have nature.

No. You have nature. Where? Well, what? Oh.

Oh, I do have a nature. What kind of nature would you have, mingle? Or just just nature nature variety. Not me. Oh, okay.

You yeah. There you are. Bam. I have a question mark. Oh.

Oh, nice to meet you. How come I have a question mark? But I have a question mark. I lied. Because you're because you are recalling knowledge, and that is a private role.

Okay. That's that's for me to know. You'd find out. Can I go too, Chris? No.

Because you're not tracking. You're like, basically, the only reason why he noticed it is because he's following the tracks. So Oh, okay. Okay. Okay.

Yeah. In other circumstances, absolutely, you could. It's just this is kind of his Nope. That's fine. Situation.

So, Tamir, you recognize that you recognize this, the scattering pattern and the size of the mandibles or the the size of the the footprints? You know exactly what is, know exactly what is, tracking, this goblin this goblin group. It is at least one ant crab, which is a horse sized insectoid creature. You're actually pretty familiar with it, because it is one of the natural predators in the area around What? Evoeton.

What? Evoeton? The the town. The town. Oh, yeah.

Okay. It's ugly. Yeah. I'm gonna come back now. Going to the bathroom now.

Is that what I heard? Yeah. Yeah. So so you are you are aware of of those creatures. You've you've actually faced a few, yourself.

They're they're natural predator in the area. You can thank one Ramsey cross for that little piece tidbit. Oh. Oh. Oh.

So, thanks. Thanks, Ramsey. So how do you wish to proceed? Well, well, boys, not the only ones following these things. And What is it?

It's an insect the size of a horse with lots of spikes and fangs. It's after goblins? It's following the goblins, it looks like. Well, I'm not in any hurry to get there. I've seen a couple of these things.

Around that and get going. Wait. Wait. Wait. I think what you just said was less force around.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But that thing's gonna go take care of some goblins for us. Let's, let's bozy a little bit.

It's kinda I I kinda see how that goes down. Yeah. I don't Jason doesn't know what Sameer knows in terms of how he's managed them in the past thing. So I very difficultly. These these are very large, very deadly creatures.

It generally takes about a group. It it generally takes a group of, well, a group of somewhat experienced people to be able to take it out. You're more confident that you'd be able to that this group would be able to handle one pretty pretty readily, but you've also seen, a lot of your, a lot of your friends and and different people in the village basically getting getting laid out by these things as they try and as they try and fend them off. They are carnivorous creatures that likes to feed on the flesh of Big Zangs. We're all familiar with this as after Jason identified it.

Yeah. Yeah. You've all fought them. They're they're like I said, they they're a natural predator in the area. You're you're all familiar with them.

I won't I wouldn't like, I said you all fought them, but maybe a few of you have not fought them, but you're at least aware of them for sure. Right. Are they due to the apocalyptic nature of our current state, or were they here before that? They were around before. Although, you know, not in this area, you don't think.

Okay. They're relatively new to this region. Right. No. So anyway, we got what what did we call this thing?

It's in Enkrav. Here, let me Enkrav. I'll put it in the Enkrav. Yeah. I'll put it in the, the chat here.

On krav. On krav. Mhmm. Yeah. On krav.

And that's, there's at least one. The way they're a little spiky feety work, it's hard to tell if there's more than one. Oh, I get to the chat. Thought bubbles in the right hand side. Oh, yeah.

I did that. Didn't I? Cute. What thought bubbles? Oh, I'm already there, but I I thought you put it somewhere else.

Oh, okay. Betsy, you give me toys. I'm gonna use them. Oh, of course. That's great.

I just I just forgot it. So I forgot about that. I scrolled back up. I'm like, oh, yeah. That's right.

I remember that prompt now. Yeah. I lost it. So as Say again. Oh, well.

I probably don't need a picture of it. It's it's reasonable. Picture. Stop. Okay.

How how fresh are those those tracks looking? Those are those tracks are actually pretty fresh. Okay. So My guess is bad. So we're Yeah.

Like maybe maybe an hour behind. Maybe an hour behind. Yeah. So You're spending depending and depending on, you know, how the wind's blowing, maybe they maybe they, might have caught wind of you. So I did not proceed all that matters.

Proceed with caution. Okay. Well, I'll make armor out of its hide. We could. It's pretty tough stuff.

Anyway alright. So, yeah, we're just it's up here. It might not be that far up here. I may switch tactics from tracking the goblins to tracking that. Believing that it's tracking the goblins.

And even if it's not tracking the goblins, I am probably as concerned about where that thing is going as I am where the goblins are going. Yeah. Good deal. Yeah. Probably.

Probably a good idea. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. So you you proceed forward.

Can you go ahead and give me another tracking rule? Come on, baby. Not bad. So you, you are able to keep better track of these creatures. For one, they're not trying to cover their tracks nearly as much.

And two, they're a lot larger to so easier to track. You are actually after about, say about three, two and a half hours, you actually, over over time you've been, you've been catching up. So you have been able to get to a point where you actually have, where you've got where you've got eyes on them. They haven't noticed you yet, but if you proceed much further, they will. They will, like, plural?

What is that about? Yeah. So you have found, you found that there is a hunting pack of three of them. Oh, even more glorious. It looks like they're still after the goblins.

They it's unclear. They're definitely tracking something, but, you know, it's definitely it but it is kind of one of those things where it's like, well, it could be the goblins or they might have caught wind of something else. Okay. So have have any of these joined the trail as we've been going, or they have clearly been following together the entire time? They have, two of them for sure have been there the whole time.

The third one, it's unclear. Could've could've added on recently, or it might have just been, you know, kind of the way the skittering worked. It basically just kind of was following in another one's footsteps. It's, but you for sure saw where another set of tracks was visible coming into this one. Right.

Okay. So it might have been that this thing was just kinda sitting around and these guys picked him up along the way, or, maybe he just was a part of the part of the pack to be in with. Alright. Well, we need to proceed with extreme caution and and keep our distance at this point. Any specific change in the goblin tracks?

Are are they also looking fresher? Any more Yeah. Fewer? Yeah. Can you give me another track of goblin tracks?

Oh, yeah. That is awesome. You lost the goblins. Oh, don't say that. Roll hey.

Use your super roll. What? You could, yeah, you could use hero point. Yes. This isn't giving me an option in that role thing to do it, does it?

No? Alright. Where do I have my hero point siding? If you just right click on the track survival check on there, there should be a reroll using hero point. About message, make private.

Okay. Scrolling down. Reroll using a hero point. There I rerolled using a hero point. Okay.

That's a much better role. Yeah. So there are there are some goblin tracks on this. They are definitely fresher. And they're just kinda like you know, they're they're not heading in a specific direction.

They're just kinda like a little bit more chaotic in this area. So they're tracks that are walking over tracks that are walking over tracks. Okay. So we're starting to see a little bit more activity in the area. Right.

I'm communicating this out. Again, reason to think that we're getting closer to home base. Alright. And go ahead and everybody roll a stealth. If you're trying to follow these guys but not attract their attention, at this point, I'm gonna need a Actually, I can't hear Nathan.

This is where it all goes south. Yeah. Okay. So whoever rolled that did a great job. Oh, stop.

Okay. Here, I mean, you're like the man that meant the legend. Yep. Super big. Super stealth.

Now this is gonna be painful. Where's my stealth? Yeah. That's what I'm doing. Oh, shoot.

That's, I use a hero point? Yeah. You should use a hero point. You should have three or two. Can't even find stealth.

Last hero point. Good job. Why do I have to suck at rolling so bad? We have a stealthy barbarian. Woah.

Yeah. I like it. Alright. Where where is stealth? Before you before you before you reroll using your hero point, Jason, let's just let's just see how Karsten does.

Well, just a minute. I I can't find I can't find it in my thingy. Yes. You're so bad at it. You don't have it?

Oh, stealth. I am untrained. That's always great. Is am I avoiding notice? No.

Just click just click on stealth, not not the Oh. Oh, yeah. The avoid notice. Just click on stealth. Oh, boy.

I need to add circumstantial bonus plus 50. I mean, I guess I guess you could click on you could do something. I'll take it. I'll take a 19. Full plate armor.

Pretty good. Not bad. Right. I'll do that. Why is the one dude who has no armor and should actually be half decent at this as an elf?

No. I don't know, man. I'm trying to patty wand. I I need some. Okay.

Well, Hey. You guys you can re roll that. I'm gonna go be a distraction. So, basically, what's gonna happen here Self replace myself. Yeah.

So Sameer's out front, and he's doing some tracking and trying to trying to avoid notice as best he can or stealth around. And, he walks up to to the top of a hill thinking that they're further ahead than they actually are. And as he crests the hill, he notices that they are that they are, really close, and then a gust of wind blows right behind him. And, the and the the and the Ankhraves immediately become rigid, look his direction, and start charging. Samir, you you run back towards the group, so you don't so you're not out, like, you know, out in front of everyone.

And just as you approach to just as you get to about where the group is, they you see the three and crab, coming around coming around the hill and up a a burnt out path. And Oh. So for those of you who use your who use your stealth, you can actually, you can actually use your stealth as your, as your initiative role if you want. Which means you don't have to roll initiative, and you just have whatever your stealth role is. I totally think that.

Fine with that. Since I've rerolled, freaking awesome. Jason, you might need to reroll, buddy. I'm gonna roll my stealth. For j Jason, for for you, you your initiative will still be perception.

So you just need to roll perception, which is probably better than yourself. Do we press the set that, Chris, or do we have to do that? Well, there is there's usually a button to press for that, but I'm not seeing it on there, so I'm just gonna set it up. Okeydoke. Initiative.

Maybe I can roll a two on this one. Oh, damn. I actually have decent. That is a bad time for a decent roll. Map is a little scary.

Yeah. So, Chris, I need to roll a d four for my, crazy beast magic? Yes. Yeah. So d four and then one to two is at level one, and two to four is level two.

Well, actually, after now that you've now, like, right now, you don't actually have a, a spell slot to gain because you're fully rested. So, the next battle today. Oh, okay. So it doesn't actuate. Okay.

Yeah. Because as long as you're as long as you're fully, as long as you are are at your full spell slots, you don't actually gain any more spell slots, which is why it's always important to be walking around with one one spell slot of every level at, spent because that way you will always regain a spell slot. I have these signature spells, and I don't know that I have or how to apply that feat to the certain spells that I'm supposed to apply it to. Let me see. Signature spells.

Those are your, your sorcerer's bloodline spells. Right? I don't know. Blood magic stuff? Is is that I don't think it's coming from that.

I think it's a feat that I took. Oh, oh, oh, signature spells. As a sorcerer, you have a certain spell that you are able to automatically upcast every every level, and that and that is your signature spell. So you choose a spell, and that spell, you can up you can cast at any level. Whereas a non signature spell, you'd have to relearn that same spell, at level two if it was a level one spell and you wanted to have a level one version of it and a level two version of it.

You, you know, you're able to you you'd have to learn it twice. Whereas a signature spell, you can upcast normally. Pretty sure. Yeah. It's Okay.

So the so they they come around they come around the hill and they're they're charging down the path. You guys are Homing in You're like, what? Yeah. You you do. I set an ambush up as I'm running by.

Next time, all of that starts in. Not on my list of things to do today. Yeah. It wasn't on mine either. So he wanted to make a darber?

Yeah. Right? That was that was messing. Alright. And then one of them comes charging down the middle, and then he, then he pulls up about You Here, that really looks like her mom when she's angry.

I'm just telling you. Pulls up right about there, and then, it rears up on its on its hind haunches, and this green globule of acid just spews out of it. It hawks a giant loogie, and shoots it right at Samir. Who do not like? Oh.

Yeah. That's not good. If it hits me, it does hit me? Yo. It hits you.

So I can It hits you. You. You could do your eerie flicker. Yep. You should eerie flicker something.

I said I would eerie flicker. I don't know what that does for me, though. What do I how do I eerie flicker? So if you go over to your actions, there's the eerie flicker reaction. I have actions to my skills, action effects.

Actions. There it is. Yep. Eerie flicker. K.

You are concealed. When you activate Eerie flicker, when you would've been hit already You're concealed for one round. Become concealed for round. So I'll go ahead and drop that on you. You're concealed, which means that They have to do a flat check.

They have to do flat check, which I'll do that, which they miss. That is amazing. Nice. Nice. Erie flicker doing its job.

Now, Jason, I need you to make a flat check, over the, Public rule d 20? Yeah. So if you look over in the in the chat area, there's an Erie flicker card. So just, yeah, click on the d 20 on there, roll the check. Ah.

So nothing happens. Nice job. So I do not have the awakening part of this yet. Right? Right.

That's that comes later. That would be a I choose that as a feat for the next well, like, as part of your as part of your progression, you just automatically will get the upgrades. So Okay. I think I think the next progression point is level five. I would have to double check it.

But anyway, this guy comes rearing up. It lobs a acidic piece of goop at you. And just as it just as if the just as the thing is about to hit you, a sudden flash of light comes from your innermost being, and and disintegrates the, the the attack before it touches you. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. It's not exactly how I envisioned that, but, hey, it worked. Oh, what's what's what is the way that you envisioned it? Tell me tell me. For just a moment, you you you see that thing, there's a green cloud flying at you.

And right when you expect it to hit, it just passes right through. I'm like, you just flat up not there for that instant. That works. But I like to put your your embellishment is is quite fun as well. I like it.

Yeah. Well, I mean, I was basically going for a this is a sun power, so, you know, I was Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No.

And that's why I I see you doing that. I'm like, I I like that. It's not how I envisioned it, but I like it. But but it could work the other way around it as well where, like, you know, the shadow covers you and, you know, oh, like an anti something. Here, you are you are up.

What you gotta do? I think it's 40 feet away. Yep. You You can, like, run 400 miles. Only running 30 feet at the moment.

Because your bladder's full. Excuse me. And we have four turns. For what? Before any of them go.

Carson, are you gonna be held to get to that guy with me? I can't get to him in time. I mean, I I could double move, and then I could hit take a swing. Yeah. That's all I can do.

Yeah. Why is this thing so big? It's a horse. It's a giant critter. Look at me.

The little barbarian next to this thing. Oh. We're gonna go ahead. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.

Oh my word. That's not even a Titan swing, Clark. Oh. That's ridiculous. Or the way way this is my ass.

Yeah. Right? Scott, you're not raging. You should have applied rage. So that's actually worse than what it looks like.

Oh, I thought it was always raging. Sorry. I forgot to rage. Yeah. That's fine.

You have you have to you you automatically rage at the beginning of your at the beginning of your combat, but you don't, but but you have to you still have to apply the effect. I'm trying to do that, but it's not letting me hit use. Excuse me. Yeah. Okay.

Rage was applied. It looks like it wasn't. I don't know. Oh, yeah. Okay.

So, let I'm just gonna do some I'm just gonna do some basic math here. So But it doesn't affect us to hit, does it? It doesn't affect his to hit, but it does affect the damage that he does. Well, yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, he's doing about 12 more points of damage than what it says. Yep. Yep.

Yep. Are you kidding me? No. Nope. Which that means he did forty forty four points of damage on that crit.

Into my ass. Oh my god. He just walks up to it, lops its head off. Great. Apparently.

Enough of this. Tired of it. Tired of this guy. Terminating insects. Alright.

That's my turn, apparently. Oh my god. Nowhere, you're up. Alright. I'm gonna be the Come on up, guys.

The air is fresh here. Well, we're gonna say the word warlock. It's this one. Alright? I it's been a minute since I did this.

Simple green for decimal. Charisma expert proficiency. Okay. Yeah. This isn't getting either of those pluses.

So hang on. Where will I add wait. Oh, it's fine. Close enough. Bam.

Woah. Oh, that seems pretty good. Alright. Cool. And it automatically applied the, the thing and automatic set the duration.

That is sick. I like it. Alright. So that was action one. Action two, I think I'm just gonna move up.

So I'm a little closer within range. What? My little gnome legs moved me 25. 20 25. We'll stand directly behind Kihir.

That sounds, smart. Don't stand behind me. And then action three. Yeah. I guess I will just shoot one of these guys with my bow.

That sounds like fun. Strike. Pew. That's a hit. Nice.

I sick. Alright. Yeah. Two points of damage. Two points of damage.

Amazing. Amazing. That's a pretty good shot from there. Oh, dude. That's great.

I got one, guys. Alright. That's me. Christian. Hi.

Christian, you're up. I'm up. I don't really know what to do. Come stand in front of me. Alright.

I'm a stand right there, and then I'm gonna lift my shield, and that's my turn. Help help. Hey. You raise shield. That's good.

There. I don't know. I like, come on. I'll go right here or there. Yeah.

Okay. Alright. And, Sameer, you're up. Oh. Which one Alwar did you did you, Oh, locked.

Barely hurt. Feller. Okay. Far are we away, buddy? 70 feet, That's a little ways.

That's woah. I clicked on me to open my thing, and it moved my place. Interesting. There you go. Rec.

Sorry. Oh, no worries. I might. Only give you, like, three actions here. It's not it's not what I'm looking for.

Yep. Let's try let's try this guy here. I think I've got him selected. Is he still selected? No.

He's not. If you just hover over him and press t, that'll target him. Yep. Okay. Sorry.

Still struggling with navigating this. Anyway, moving on. K. We're gonna do frostbite. Frostbite.

You are currently out of range for frostbite. Even with my reach? Oh, it would be okay. It's 60 with the reach. I saw it say 60.

I thought it would go to one twenty. So I guess I need to move. Well, let me see here. No. You don't need to move.

If you're using reach spell, then it'll go up to 90, which you you are within 90. So if you're Okay. Using reach spell and then casting frostbite, then, yes, you're you're hitting 90. Oh, you're good. Okay.

Sorry. That's what I'm planning to do. Sorry. I I misunderstood what you were doing. He critically succeeds.

He critically succeeds. Wow. Wow. Dang it. That's sad.

I really got good fork, dude. So he just dodges it entirely. Is that how that works? Yeah. Yeah.

A critical a critical succeed means he takes no damage. So, He rolled a 19. Looks like it. Oh, he rolled a 17. Oh, but the DC on that was 19.

Okay. Yeah. What's the plus 10 from? Is that just That's third and save. Okay.

So that required two actions to do, And the reach spell was another action. So right? So that was all three then. Yeah. K.

So you have me. Boo hiss. Hey. Guess what, Vance? You did more damage than I did.

Yeah. Yeah. It's true. That is true. He's a big end.

Yep. This one charges up at Cahir. That was the guy that lost all kinds of sand. They can't see that. They don't have any eyes.

It's all based on sonar. It's going to make a armor rending bite miss. And How far can they move in one move? A lot. 50 feet away.

Well, actually, it didn't do an armor rending bite because it didn't have the two actions to spend. It just tried to swing it just tried to bite you. But regardless, it missed. So, second one. Cars.

They're so big. Oh, gosh. They take up lots of spaces. Yeah. Yes.

This one is going to attempt to munch and crunch a Karsten. I don't know. Oh oh, he does. He he he does mention he does munch and he does crunch. Oh.

Oh, yeah. He did. Oh, boy, did he. That's ridonkulous. Okay.

Let's roll that damage. Easy money. Ow. You wish you shield block. No.

I mean, it's only four points, so no. Okay. What do I put? Damage? No.

I'm putting damage on you, but you're but you're choosing not to block. So we'll just do the full 26 points of damage. Yep. Okay. It grabs you in its mandibles and munches and crunches and you feel the you feel your armor starting to creak under the under the, under the pressure of these mandibles.

Big things. K. Here. You're up. Oh, brother.

I think I turned on Titan swing. I'm raging. The hit. I'm I'm having a brain fart. On the Titan swing, I just hit like normal.

I just have to click the box. Right? Right. If you do want to add a plus two to your hit, if you get into a flanking position, you will get a you will get a plus two to your attack, which could meet the difference between the other side of it. Yeah.

I'm with you. I'm just that would cost me an action. Kinda like that one twice. I hear. I mean okay.

Or you have a better chance of credit. Yeah. The plus two is an extra 10% chance to credit. Thinking though how many hero points we have. We could have three.

Two. Mhmm. Mhmm. Let's just let's just hit them with the Titan. Oh.

Miss. Oh, do your hero point. Reroll that hero point. That was terrible. Much better.

Oh, you got the plus. You did. You're good. Big money? Oh.

Pretty good. Alright. You cut into into this this creature's scaly hide, but it's even though look even though it looks like it's in severe pain, it still is still has some life left inside. Not feeling good. It still has lots of life.

Hit it again. Oh, not bad. Uh-huh. Nice. Well, it it is not feeling good.

Oh, it's Oh. To tune of pets. That would kill him. You're no longer flanked. No way.

Hey. Arson? Alright. Elwar, you're up. Alright.

I'm just checking one thing. Don't do anything icy. Doesn't work. I don't know how this would work. I don't think that will work.

Nope. It will not because it has the linguistic tag, and I'm assuming these things cannot understand me. I know. That seems unlikely. Well, we've got a couple people to go.

Carson is hurt, though. I mean, not really. It's just a more like a lesson. Yeah. Yeah.

We're not, like, badly hurt, but you're hurt. Is this worth a spell slot too? Let me check one last thing. Sorry. Sorry.

We will I did take that. Alright. Sick. So I'm not going to do that. I am going to, we will just hit it with the old reliable.

Where is my small casting? There it goes. We will electrohark it. Not very good, but every little bit. It failed.

Alright. Cool. Six hole damage. And for act Six. For action three, we are going to demoralize it, because I have intimidating glare.

It doesn't need to have a language. So I will glare at this thing and kind of, make a motion over to, to hear and those dead ones, you know, indicate its its future. Where damn it. Demoralize. There it is.

I would like to do the thing. Okay. There we go. Bam. We're rolling.

Not great. Oh, success, though. It's right in one. I'll take it then. I will take it for right in one.

He's got skulls spinning around him. Yep. Alright. That's a me. Titan swing.

Alright, red team. I guess I don't have to really do them, do I? First in Europe. No need to go anywhere. Alright.

There we go. Big boot. Big boot. Get him. Titan swing.

Titan swing is on. Murder. Murder death kill. Looks like a hit. A wall hit.

Yeah. It's a hit. What is the frightened status due to it? Oh, nice. It's basically negative one to everything.

So all of it saves, it's a c, and it's to hit or all negative one. Nice. What, so What? So you you hit it. You cut deep into its flesh, but it is still up and alive.

What is your next action? It's a lot of and will be gonna do a Titan swing. Right. But I will do this one. I do need to Target is pushed back five feet.

Oh. Oh, yeah. It is pushed back five feet by the Titan swing. Does it need to? I don't wanna move.

If I move let me let me check, but I'm pretty sure that the Titans will just automatically pass the push. Fire Jason. Sorry. Make melee strike if it hits you deal extra damage die and push the target back by five feet. Yeah.

If you're at least tenth level increases to two extra dice, and the target gets pushed back 10 feet. Titan swing barely at this barely comes into play with the barbarian because he one shot kills everything. The Nevermind Not true. I will, guess I'll be a Popsicle meat stick. I can't do anything because I question with us?

My guy is over can you move him? Can't select my guy. Because you are underneath an already dead thing, just use your arrow keys. I can't I can't select him. I can't use my arrow keys.

You're automatically selected. Just use your arrow keys. Should be at least. No. They don't work.

Oh, hey. Anyway, there you go. Hey. Thanks. Now raise my shield.

Well, you can only do one or one or the other of those things. Taking a step that costs an action, raising shield costs an action. You've only got one action. I I just raised my shield. Yeah.

Oh, and also Tahir and Carsten, I need both of you to make flat checks for your Titan swings. What do I gotta do? Pull a d 20. If you have a if you have a above a five, nothing bad happens. Why?

Because It's over a five. Yeah. Because Titan Swing basically takes something out of you when you use it. So I think it's a backlash. Yeah.

Oops. Sorry. That's not it. Okay. That's it.

It's a little bit easier to get above a five with the d 20 than the d eight. Well, you can One would think But I was gonna say That's right. Okay. That's my problem. I have no faith.

Let's see. Sameer, you're up. I'll work on that. Oh my gosh. Alright.

And we're going to how far away are you? Sorry. I had this checked in my head once. Oh, yeah. The range is 60 feet.

I'm great. So we're going to, do this. I'm gonna do that. Attack. I'm not using the respell, so this is just a one one action deal.

Oh, look at that. And I will roll for damage. I did eight damage. She's now, she's now cooking a little bit. Roasty toasty.

Alright. Large. He's not feeling good. He's not feeling good. You should consider his diet.

Mhmm. Gonna chase the the snackable. A snackable? Yep. Oh, I am not snack I am apparently snackable.

Oh, no. Would you like to eat any slicker? I absolutely would. Yes. Alright.

Like, what? Yes. Right? Do you have anything else? Where is Yeah.

I think I think you have to actually activate that. Yep. Okay. Skills actions, eerie flicker. Oh, wait.

Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. I've also got this thing.

What does this do? Oh, no. That doesn't that doesn't I've definitely acted hostile towards this creature. I cannot empathetically it. Alright.

Cool. We will eerie flicker though. Boop. Okay. So you are concealed.

Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And I'm going to go ahead and try and make that flat check. Oh, well, crap.

Yeah. Nothing's gonna happen. Yeah. Alright. Oh, see you guys on the other side.

Alright. Cool. Now I need to make my flat check too. Ow. I mean, I'm up, but that hurt a lot a lot.

He's got two big ones. Right. I'm gonna make a nine flat check. I don't see. Alright.

I'm just gonna roll up. Nope. I did the same thing you did. That was the eight. That's a 20.

Oh, shit. Oh, this is very bad. Alright. What does this backlash do? It doesn't say in here.

Alright. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.

Cool. Cool. Why did you have to do that? I took a backlash. I failed my check for my eerie flicker.

What is this thing called? Deviant. Yep. Dragonfall wraith. That is a wraith one.

My old backlash. I am frightened three. Woah. Alright. Well, cool.

I am frightened three. I mean, that tracks. This thing just damn near bit me in half. It did. Okay.

So you have the encroaching presence effects. I just Yeah. Dropped it on you. Sick. And, yeah, I think that's that's its turn.

Here, you're up. Yeah. This guy has caught in trouble. Just gonna try to hit it. It does hit.

Critical. And just for the record, the reason why you created was because of the courageous anthem and that it was frightened. Yeah. The way you like you were right at ten. Yeah.
