And we are good there. Does everybody remember where we left off? We are going into the Cave Of Awesomeness and kick some tushy Mhmm. Surrounded by a literal dump truckload of dead goblins. That's That's an under dump truckloads of goblins waiting to be deleted.

Well, I'm going to the source, though. Go into the source. Alright. Yeah. So you guys were indeed you guys have the gist of it.

Last last we met, you guys went back to the, the Temple Of Time Temple Of Time. Or whatever it's called. I like that. Huge mistake. It it's called something different.

It's Latin, I'm pretty sure. So, you know, that one. Carson, you have a cute little picture there. Handsome little w. What are you talking to?

I don't know. You? Carson. He said, Carson, you have a pretty picture. Oh, yeah.

I'm pretty. I'm a I'm a pretty and that's all Chris's fault. I mean, he made me pretty. So, you know, good job, Chris. It was time.

It was time for me to Something had to be done about that ugly mug. I thought I mean, I thought I was pretty style of none, but apparently not. Mhmm. If you wanna go back to your old picture, I can do that. I just thought you would like to have a better resolution photo.

No. I, I I think, Chris, what the update is looks great. If if, mister Jason thinks I look great, then I I agree with him. Mhmm. Mhmm.

Voice of wisdom. That's right. We go. Oh, okay. So last time we met, you guys went back to the temple where, it was being overrun by goblins.

You defended the bridge and slowly moved your way into the opening in the rock wall, that was, that was broken open by the goblins, by the goblins that you've been, working or or that you've been trying to stop for the past, six months. Upon entering the temple or entering the temple. Upon entering the cave, you did see that, there is zero light in there other than what is being, other than what is being, other than what is coming in from the entrance. You do see shapes moving in the darkness, and, you also remember having heard some sort of commanding voice coming from inside the inside the temple. Do you have a hard fought battle, but you have not, you have not quite finished the battle yet?

You may notice that this map is more of a traditional map. It doesn't have much of the fancy stuff. It's it's more just a more just a, regular line drawing map. Obviously, at this point, you're probably not seeing a whole lot, but, over time, you'll see more. Don't expect to see some super high resolution, map in this one.

This is more it's gonna look more like, kind of like a, like a cardholder map. So Nice. But yeah. So you are fight you have, you have a bunch of goblins right in front of you. As you push your way in, there is a, there there is a, tunnel that you're moving down, but it does look like it might be getting larger, and opening up in a little bit.

And I need people to roll initiative. Uh-huh. I am going to use, my new feet that I forgot last time entirely. Yay. New feet.

Where is it? From my Kronoskimmer dedication. If I choose, I do choose, I can destabilize my timeline, my time stream, attempt a DC 11 flat check. Okay. And what does that mean in English?

Which I did. I succeeded. Excellent. What? Out of success, your initiative is equal to 19 plus your initiative modifier.

So I rolled a 25. On a failure, it is one to pluff my initiative modifier. Ouch. So it is go first or go last, which coincidentally are two of the positions on the initiative order I want. Mhmm.

Oh, really? Mhmm. Yeah. Going to the middle is generally not where I wanna be. Right.

Fair enough. I mean, I'd rather go first. Don't get me wrong. But, so obviously, we've not had any time to rest of any kind. Right.

Excellent. Excellent. Okay. Cool. Cool.

Cool. Cool. Oh. I hope you are you are, rolling something or healing everyone or something. How about healing everyone?

Okay. So I'll update your it was 24 initiatives? 25. 25. How do you know your success or failure on that, Ramsey?

So with a flat check, they'll always have, like, DC whatever. This was a DC 11. So on 11 or higher, it's a success. Yep. Gotcha.

Alright. Since we all have rolled our initiative, let's begin the battle in the tunnel. The battle in the tunnel. Right. First up is our Sick sick sick.

Again So hey. Again, you and I'm in the Again, you see a, a, short tunnel. You're not really able to see beyond that, but you get the impression that the tunnel is no isn't going to be a tunnel for very much longer. It's, it's it's got the feeling of a room being beyond that. The rough stone walls, are on both sides.

It's clear that it was that it's been excavated, recently, and there are some singe marks as if there were explosions that were, explosives that were used in there as well. In the What do you do? Excellent. Well, we are out of focus, but I will still use Kratos Anthem, for my first action. So everybody grab your Kratos Anthem.

I don't have to do that every turn, but that's okay. For action two, we are going to use we're well out of sight of the people up top. Correct? Correct. Excellent.

That is good news. What do you mean by up top? Like the townsfolk. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. For action two, I'm going to use sign of the sun.

Yeah. I am going to turn into a blazing beacon of light. Yes. I was gonna do that too. But so that we can see a little better.

And I'm not I'm looking at the thing. There doesn't seem to be a thing. But maybe I drag this out of me. Yeah. There we go.

Oh, yeah. We can blind them. We have blinding damage. Yeah. And tell and you can do it that way as well.

But there if you go into the action menu, there's a use Ah, okay. Button of science and science. You click that and there and there's a play spell effect on me, button that'll appear on the, on the in the chat as well. So either way. Yeah.

Sweet. Sweet. Alright. And then for my third action, I'm going to, look at this, poorly placed fellow right in front of Cahir, and I'm going to give him an intimidating glare. Yeah.

Intimidating glare. Small man. Yeah. Look at him. Yeah.

Gonna kinda look at him, look at Cahir, look back at him, but give him the, what what like to be you kinda look. Yeah. You're in trouble, buddy. Sorry, buddy. No.

Right. Oop. This It's the sad eyes. Oh, man. Or it's a stink eye.

Okay. There we go. I I got there. Bam. A demoralized.

Yeah. Do it. He was almost very demoralized, but that'll work. Boom. Alright.

6. That's me. That's three. Dude, that's awesome. Thank you.

I mean, I don't say that in game because I can't see, but Oh, somehow I have two courageous anthems. I don't think it matters. I'm not gonna stack. But Yeah. I don't know how that one's doing.

I got one I got two as well. I have two as well. I think there might be a like, from the previous one, from the previous thing, I think you might have had a lingering composition that was still active. Gotcha. Okay.

If you do want to if you want to change your action based off of that, we can. No. It's fine. I don't know what we're gonna do with the single action anyway. So Okay.

And it only had one round remaining. They both had one round. So no. It's fine. Alright.

So, let's see here. Just got Who's that guy? Medium humanoid. He's a guy. I believe it is.

Cannot see him. He's just a dude, plain a dude, disguise another dude. Oh, oh, we might be about to see him. Oh, oh, oh. And then second that we got to check his movement.

I gotta check his movement. Make sure he's got the movement to do the thing that I want him to do. Nope. Nope. That's pretty slow.

They have a cave tool. Mhmm. They have a cave tool. And cave tool. Outlaw and ugly.

Oh, what is that thing? What you what you see, is a a creature comes lumbering out of the darkness. Well, lumbering is not exactly the correct word, but, in comparison to the goblins that you've been facing, this this creature stands ahead and foot taller than, than them. It carries a large sword and currently has, a dagger in its hand, and is in full plate armor. Oh.

Oh. He's not gonna walk away. He's fluffy. He has. Yes.

The large, hairy oblin welding thing. Uh-huh. Big gremlin. Sounds interesting. Mhmm.

And he's a and as he comes out, he says, come on, boys. This is the chance that we've that we were looking for. Mhmm. And he will and he will chuck a dagger. Oh.

He's a chucker. Mother chucker. He's going to do it with a twin faint. So that costs two actions. He feints, which puts the which automatically puts the target off guard and then flings the dagger at you, which missed horribly.

Excellent. Who's he flinging it at? Carsten. It it the dagger glances off of Carsten's shield. I mean, real quick, I should have 21.

You should have 21 what? My AC should be 21. You're off guard. Yes. Oh, okay.

That's why. I just okay. Yep. That makes sense. Yep.

So you're right. You should have 21. But he's a Trixie fellow. So Trixie. So you have so you you he caught you unaware.

I don't know if it's possible. I'm pretty I'm pretty aware. I'm not, obviously. And no. Alright.

And then next up is here. K. Here. Yeah. How to target people.

Sorry. Where's the top things that have all the actions and stuff on them along the top of the screen? I don't know. Things are laid out a good deal different. I don't know.

Oops. I hit a button. It took me out of the map. Oh. What did I do, Chris?

You didn't. Never mind. You figured it out. There's a back button. Yep.

There's a back button. Right. Go to actions on it. Do you guys have that along the top of your screen anymore? No.

I don't see it. It's a it's an add on. It might have I'm not seeing it in here anymore. Oh, oh, buddy. That's beautiful.

Maybe it lost maybe it lost support. That guy dies. Well, let's see what happens. Almost just internally. That's impressive.

Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You can't hardly get a better role than that, dude. Oh. That's that's too bad.

Yeah. That's too bad. Yes. You do, in fact, take your large Oh, your your large, axe and cleave goblin cleave goblin in Twain. You have two more actions.

What are you gonna do? Well, I think I'll just wait back here and let you hear keep getting it. Well done. Goon. It's more difficult to do the action going in and out of your character sheet.

Alright. I'll see if I can find this. I'm just telling you I'm so slow. Oh, it's okay. Oh, did you get a bit hurt?

Oh my god. It was not great. But Got a grip. It's close, so let's see what we can do. Let's see what we can do.

Excellent. Oh, gosh. He's dead. Holy moly, buddy. Let's go.

Let's go. I see myself kinda cutting the first guy in half, stepping forward, and then swinging, cutting the other guy in half horizontal. Right. I expect turns. You get whacking.

I'm just listening. I can laugh. Good rolls. I like those good rolls. Wow.

Yeah. Those are amazing. This goblin is going to use its reaction to goblin scuttle. Which goblin scuttle? That is.

Ramsey's laughing. He's running away. It's what it sounds like. Yep. He is going to My turn done.

How do I get my turn? Right. So this one, this goblin is going to pop out. It's going to there's my So, Ramsey, by you casting light on them, does that help us not get injured as badly when we can see them? Sort of.

Or we can see them, which is helpful. Yeah. Okay. Probably because I know So the biggest the biggest help is if you can't see them, it's harder for you to like, the target numbers are higher. So Yep.

They have concealment. I see. This is annoying. I wanted to target Zahir, but I can't target Zahir. So Who's in the spot?

I don't know. Oh, yeah. You did I don't My dead body's around me. Wait a second here. No.

I'm going to target you, and then I'm gonna move you back up. Okay. Okay. And he's going to pull out a short bow Uh-oh. And shoot.

And target it as well. I just wanna have here targeted, so I'm going to retry that. He's gonna miss with his first one, but he's gonna shoot a second arrow and miss with that. Woah. Woah.

Very sad. Oh. So much. Another goblin comes out of the shadows or gets kicked here again. How'd you move him up?

I moved myself up. He's there. And he's going to shoot his confusers. Oh. Oh.

Miss. Oh. He's gonna shoot again. Oh my gosh. Miss.

Oh my gosh. Critical miss. Man, we're rolling. This guy is going to target guy here. He's just such a popular guy.

I'm feeling a little bit picked up. He seems like when you're the main man, like, you're holding a trigger to change. I had to figure out some dead bodies. Blood splatters. Too many dead bodies.

Well, let's not try to stop that. Miss pretty badly. And then he's going to try to distract to hear. Critical success. Distracting words.

Oh, swear words. So he starts telling you about all of the about the millions of goblins that are in here in the dark that he doesn't see and how much Cahir is going to, is going to be beaten beaten up and that kind of thing. And as you as he tells you that story, you start looking around distracted. And, when you interesting. And when you look you look around, he appears to he appears to have vanished.

He melted into the stone. He is hidden to you. The one right in front of me? The one right in front of you. He's no longer right in front of you.

He's no longer right in front of you. He's somewhere. But That's alright. One of the other guys will kill him. Runs out, and he's going to finish.

We can't is not the right call here. So he's going to, again, target Cahir. His Cahir is actually within reach, and he's going to attack with his large knife that looks like a short sword. Oh, oh. He's gonna miss.

He's going to lunge forward and, and kinda topple over, recovers himself and comes back with a backswing, which actually hits. What? Dealing five points of damage to Cahir. Oh, boy. You're in trouble.

Cahir is critically injured. Oh, man. Badly injured. No poke left. Alright.

The guy who stepped back, he's going to gonna target Karsten, and he's gonna shoot him with a bow. He's going to miss, then he's going to go back 20 feet and shoot him again and miss again. Oh, get a big roll. And and another goblin reveals itself out of the out of the, back there, and he will he will likewise target Karsten and shoot twice. Close.

Oh, almost. Yeah. Not quite. And, Sameer, you're up. It is your turn for me.

Yep. So you basically you walk in. Cahir walk walks up, cuts two goblins in two, and then just a bunch of goblins start scuttling out of the dark, firing arrows at at Cahir and attacking Cahir, and a few more come scuttling out and fire some arrows at Carson. But Carson's armor and shields are able to are able to keep him, keep him aloft, or keep him protected. And now it's your turn.

Well, yeah, let's, let's try a little little this. We'll I'm gonna try a telecandidate projectile. Kill him. Okay. So I got the target.

I will pass. Yeah. So just, you know, the loose rubble around Mhmm. Something that seems within range. Of course.

There are plenty of rocks and rubble and different things. Are you going to be hitting with flushing damage, piercing damage, or slashing damage? Because a rock can do any of those. Yeah. I think we'll try slashing.

K. So we'll try this. Oh, need to attack. Your attack? Attack.

There it is. It's like, attack. Oh. That's pretty good. That's a splendid roll.

Wow. That's an awesome roll. And you do hit. So roll that damage. Roll the damage.

Who are you throwing it at? Oh, whack. Oh, that's not bad for me. I believe it's the goblin that's right in front of you, Cahir. Cahir.

Yeah. The one right in front of Cahir. Oh, he is he's wounded. That is the most Damn. Is the most wounded How do you want to have killed him?

Done. Oh. Oh, wow. You just straight up killed him then. Oh, that's fantastic.

That's crazy. So, yeah, a a a stone that was, you know, kind of right in front of, oh, Arston, Nice nice diagonal. Just launches itself up off the ground and, just comes straight across the the goblin's neck. Nice little Fuck. Head still on.

You know, not not not that bad, but it just clearly cut a bunch of important arteries. So a fountain of blood spews from the goblin's neck and hits Cahir straight in the chest. What happened? You were you were just minding your own business being attacked by a goblin and the whole other. Yeah.

And then all of a sudden, the he he was in fact hidden too, and you still you still hit him. I mean, that was good role. So you're minding your own business and then all of a sudden, out of the shadows, a, rocks a rock flings into the shadows then a and then a spray of red blood comes out and and covers your covers your chest, and then a goblin falls out of the shadows in front of you dead. Nice. Spectacular.

Alright. Alright. I'm gonna move forward, and I'm gonna whack the guy in front of me. Sounds good. Yep.

There we go. I am Harry, winter dawn this. Nice. Nice. That is indeed a hit.

So you pull out your pull out your bastard sword or you've got it all right out. Swing in. Boom. Feeling full of damage. Wow.

Dead. And I'm going to raise my shield. I don't wanna raise my shield. In your character sheet, there is a raise shield action that's right next to your shield. Oh, it's already already raised.

Well, it you'll go ahead and raise it again because it's gonna I can't. At the end of your at the end of your turn, it'll There's no raised button. There usually is. Yeah. There there is no dealer shield.

It's right. There is no target trigger cam. What if I there you go. Razor shield cam. There it is.

I found it. Yeah. I think we ended up in a really weird state because I ended the combat before your initiative round came through. And so it was going to and so you you're at a different initiative spot and it and that you raised your shield because your shield was already raised, but it wasn't gonna be raised until you know? So Yeah.

Exactly. So this guy is gonna come out and target Karsten, and we're gonna get a few more torque bow arrows winging going at Karsten, but both of them miss by a mile. So he deflects the arrow somebody else. That's right. He he well, they don't really miss by a mile.

It's more of a he deflects them with the field so they don't hit Auer who's behind him. He's a very good protective champion. He hit Auer. You are up. Alright.

Let me see. Step one, is definitely re up Corita's Anthem, because that will be going away. Everybody pull it in. Step two Oh, yeah. Let me take a look here real quick.

Says I lack permission. Where did that guy okay. He missed. I don't know if that means anything. Alright.

Why not? We'll try something else. We've not done yet. Well, I guess we have, technically. But, I am going to, what's the word?

Recall knowledge. Mhmm. On this big old dude here. Okay. And with my bardic lore, I get to do that with my bardic lore versus his, whatever specific lore he has.

Old bardic lore. Bam. So so. Let me see. Okay.

You did hit the easy DC. Yep. Exit. Which I don't know what that says. So I I've never done recall knowledge before.

Renzi, you used to do those all the time with, with with Dave. What did they do? So it was one of the things that's been changed. And from what I recall, and I could be a little incorrect here, but in the new, kind of iteration on a success, you got to ask essentially for, like, a one piece of information, and then get it. So what first of all, you identify the creature and then also get a piece of information.

So typically not a number. So it's not like what's its AC, but stuff like what is its lowest defense or what is its highest defense or does it have any weaknesses or resistances or things like that. Alright. So that would be, well, then what's your what is your question? Alright.

I would like to know if this thing has any weaknesses. Nice. Has any weaknesses. It well, first off, you you identify this as a bugbear. Ah, yes.

It is a medium sized goblin egg creature, but not not the same race as a goblin. Oh. But they are interrelated. It's kind of like a distant second, third cousin twice removed sort of situation. Okay.

And it's, to your knowledge, bugbears have no weaknesses. Okay. Excellent. Stick with the pointy end. Alright.

Does now with, the like, the electric arc thing Mhmm. That spell, if I remember correctly, says, hey. If you're wearing metal armor, which it was stated that he has full plate on, that does do something to him, does it not? Like, he takes extra damage or If the spell says it, then it's probably some status effect that he has, but it could be extra damage. Interesting.

And my third and final action, we are going to also give him a glare of intimidation. Kinda, again, look at the, splattered remains of the the goblins in front of him, look back at my, my friends at the front line and just give them a shrug. Like, I guess you're up. Good luck. And, I need to get to there again.

Bam. Okay. Bam. We will intimidate him or try to. Oh, not so great.

Nine. Oh, that is an offer of success. We'll take it. Was enough. Wow.

So he seems slightly concerned by the situation that he finds himself in. I will take it. Alright. That's a b. Okay.

That makes it his turn. Wow. Good job. Let's see. What's he going to do now?

I had an idea about what he was gonna do, but then now he's slightly frightened. Oh. You know what? We'll we'll stick with it. He's gonna step in.

He's gonna target Karsten. He's gonna take his great sword and swing, hitting Karsten for 14 points of damage. Yeah. He does. Oh.

Yikers. Yeah. Understand he's now near death. Well, I I would like to point out, Mark, that you have your shield raised. So, actually, let's let's fix this back here.

You have a reaction. You have your shield raised, which you can use a reaction to shield block, which means that your shield will take damage that will reduce the amount of damage that you take. After your shield takes too much damage, it will break and you will be without a shield, so that's something that you need to keep an eye on. But if you don't wanna take the full 14 points of damage, you can choose to block. Yes.

Recommended. Also, to be clear, break in this case does not mean it is gone. It means it needs to be repaired. Oh, right. Right.

Alright. It's gonna be used to be And it can't be used. Gone though. Oh, it can't be used? While it's broken, it can't be used.

You you would need to repair it. But your your your shield has hit points. So if you open up your character sheet, you look at your shield. Your shield has hit points. Yep.

It will block Oh, I don't see the hit points. Oh, block? Oh, wait. Sorry. Just a minute.

It'll block the hardness value of the shield in damage that you receive. Yep. So it is It still can't be totally broken, can't it, Chris? It just has to be or did they change the way that works? I think they changed it in the remaster.

Originally Where do I see the where do I see the hardness? You see your armor class section? You see the shield HP? Right underneath the shield HP, there's an h four. That's hardness.

Your hardness of four. So it'll reduce the amount of damage that you take by four, and your shield will take that damage instead of you. But then I can't use it? No. As long as you've got as long as your shield has hit points, you can use it.

If I have zero hit line points, I can't use it. Right. So And I'm I'm gonna have my shield take three hit points, and I will take 11 hit points of damage. No. It's it's either it it's equal to the hardness value of the shield.

So you can't choose how many hit points you take. Oh, okay. I'll just take the four the four the full blunt the brunt of that team then. Really? Yep.

I wanna keep my shield with all these critters, and I don't know what's gonna happen. Oh, you will. You're so right next okay. So there's the four hardness, and then next to that is the it says b t and then done. That is the broken threshold.

It needs to take 10 hit points before it breaks. Oh, okay. I see. I didn't see that. It will take four if you block this hit.

Yep. Is that reckless? Or does it take off? By I honestly we didn't shield block a lot at the other campaigns. No.

We didn't. But Entirely held those motions. I did play a character that had a shield for, like, a session or two. But from what I from what I remember, your your shield doesn't break until your shield hits zero hit points. The the shield broken threshold, I'm not sure about that.

Yeah. That's what I thought was that the broken threshold was when it's broken but can be repaired. And when it hits zero, it's done so. But, again, that could have changed to the remastered. I have no idea.

Yeah. But regardless, Clark, you're not gonna shield block and then lose your shield for the rest of the for the rest of the thing. Yep. That's the important part. And you otherwise, you're gonna take 14 points of damage.

Yeah. How do but if I shield block, how do I not lose it for the whole rest of the encounter if it's broken? That's what I'm saying. If you have if you have a crafting skill, you can choose to repair it, but that takes time. Yeah.

So it might not be something that you can do in the mid I do have I have no. The the reason I say that is if we're gonna keep fighting, then I'm not gonna have time. I would rather just take the 14 if if I'm gonna break it and lose it. Does that make sense? Right.

Yeah. That will Clark, just just for you just for the record, that means that you'll have eight hit points left. Yep. That means you will die or at least drop. Clark, just take the four hit points off.

Your shield's not gonna break. Your shield is not not as important as you. Mhmm. Yep. It's only four hit points.

That's the difference of you having eight hit points and you having 12 hit points. That's the difference of you having being one shotted and you being able to survive another one. Then I break my shield. But I'm, like, honestly, like, honestly, I feel like I'm over pressuring you on this. If you want if you don't wanna use it, then don't use it, and we'll do the 14, and it's not that big of a deal.

Either way. Yeah. It's just you're low on hit points, and that's when you start that's when you're going to want to have your shield. Because if you get hit for 15 you get hit for 15 points of damage after this, if you shield block with it, it's not gonna matter. Right.

But I will still have my shield. Whereas you'll be able to if you yeah. But if you shield block now, that would save you four. In the next hit you take, you can shield block again or you can, yeah, you can shield block again, and that's another four. So that's you saving yourself eight hit points rather than just four in a crucial moment.

Alright. I guess I'm confused still. I don't under I don't wanna keep my AC of 21. How do I do that? I just take 14 damage.

Yeah. Alright. And then he's going to go away. Yeah. Do we get a type of opportunity?

No. Nope. Have you had an attack of opportunity during this entire game? I thought I would. No.

That's an ability that you can get at some point, but it's not an ability you have at the moment. Alright. So here you're up. I'm gonna go stand behind these other guys because that guy just made me scared. So no.

I need you to heal me. I don't have any potions or anything. Do I? I don't know. I gave mine away, so I have none.

Alright. As asking the barbarian to heal you is is Chris, something happened to me last round from a guy who died. Is that Well, you off? Yeah. The effect wore off.

You he basically just distracted you, which he didn't actually instill fear in you. He was just like, we've got we've got dozens of us out here, which made you start glancing around, looking around, and that's when you lost sight of him. But you you're not afraid. You're they're you know, you're still in full range. No problem.

Okay. If I go which I can't move. If I go here, can I hit the guy diagonal to me if I kill the guy in front of me? Absolutely. Let's do that.

Hey. You're really far out. Just be careful. You don't have a lot of life either. I know, but let's die together.

There you go. I didn't say that to you. If you don't if you don't kill these guys, they will kill you. So just saying. We're gonna take a chance here.

What else we got to do? Call for reinforcements. You're good. We don't have that. You are the reinforcements.

Alright. Right? I bought the brute squad. You are the brute squad. Do some damage.

Alright. That's some pretty good damage. One one suckback. That's three times as much damage as I did. Mhmm.

You guys do damage. Right. Right. What? What?

I do damage vicariously. Right. It makes everybody else do damage more times. Pay the money. Every once in a while, I make a hit of I called the button.

That's not me. Sorry. You roll the damage. I I accidentally clicked the button. Alright.

Wanna do some damage, Chris? You can do it if you want. Oh, that was terrible. I'd rather you I think if I rolled double ones, they still die. Yeah.

Yeah. With the goblins, yes. Yeah. With the goblins, yes. Alright.

I'm on an island here, people. Help me. I'm done. Alright. You got this goblin.

He's gonna run up, pull out his sword, and attack Karsten. No. No. I'm still we love you. Could be it.

Seems rude. I miss this one. Oh. That's violent. Alwar, stab him in the back.

Right? He will if he gets the opportunity, I'm sure, or something else. Deal he hits you as he stabs you in the back, dealing three points of damage. Near to death. Jeez.

Indeed. Fearless. I don't know why on my screen, but Carson's character looks like the old character. That's why he's not he's Oh. I'm I've done that.

His hair his hair with that nice little curl in the front definitely would be distracting, the goblins. But that's for next time. Here we go. Oh, that's more like it. Oh, man.

I'm almost there. I see that face near death. He looks great near death. And this goblin? He's going run it again?

Isn't that possible? Yep. It's just an action. Move it. Move.

It is. They're using what are commonly referred to in the vernacular as tactics. Alright, Samir. You're up. Oh, please save me.

Lightning bolt those guys. Oh, drums Lightning bolt them? Yeah. Potion. I'm running out of lightning bolts.

Fireball. Sort of. Healing. Healing. Where where my screen is.

Alright. So a guy just moved in from Carson. Alright. Alright. Then there's the big creature that's out there somewhere.

Yeah. I would also so I can't see him. Right. But I would also like to just remind people that Albert isn't the only one who has the ability to, to light himself up. Yeah.

Yep. Lots of people can light themselves up. Yes. Exactly. I don't know what lighting yourself up does, but It makes you be able to see.

It also gives you resistance to spirit damage, which at this in this exact instance doesn't really matter a whole lot. Right. Being able to actually see might be valuable because you can't see right now. So but I'm not saying that specifically for you, Jason, because, you know, Sameer is more of a back line backliner. But people are in the front line, for sure, for sure, it might not be a bad idea for you to actually, you know Do that.

Light yourselves up. Like, I can and up. Yeah. Did I did I accidentally abilities. Oh, okay.

Great. Alright, Jason. Go ahead. I character sheet keeps getting away. Alright.

That's fine. Okay. I am going to do the electrical arc. Yeah. Get him.

This guy won't let me do it. This guy. Alright. I'd like to select the guy in front of Cahir, but, because he's blood stained, I can't. Suggestions.

What guy in front of Cahir? The guy. Sorry. Not Cahir. Sorry.

Karsten. Karsten. Why can't you do that? He's not a corpse. He's not a yeah.

And and corpses just don't let you click on him. The guy in front of me? He's alive. Yeah. Well, he's alive, but he's standing in the name of him.

Houston trying now. Yes. There you go. Oh, dear. No.

That that failed. Sorry. I screwed up. And I think it's a shift double click to get both of them. It must be because it wasn't a control.

Yep. There we go. Boom. Yeah. We're Where are you going, boy?

There you go. Run away. Run away. Run away. Alright.

So I'm rolling savings of not team. You don't have you don't roll. Yep. Yep. They roll.

I'm sorry. They roll. Let them roll that. Yes. So reflex for one.

Probably, let me go ahead and sorry. I need to use the correct thing. Okay. And the other one Oh, is that a tie thing they have to tie? Or is that yeah.

Oh my gosh. Great success. Alright. So one of them completely evades. The other one takes half damage.

So go ahead and roll your damage. Not the worst damage I've done. I was assuming the first one, the one that's in front of Carson is the one that did not have time for me to reflex. He he was indeed the one that did not take the damage or that did take the damage. The other one basically because he couldn't succeed.

He basically just kind of evaded everything. And, Karsten, you were up. I am going to whack the guy right in front of me. K. Maybe I can click on him.

Give me a second. I'm sorry. Oh, I did it. I remember the bug spiders. Yeah.

That's weird. And whack a mole. Oh, seriously? Wow. Alright.

I'm going to lay out hands myself for that is. I'm gonna cast it. Right? Oh, I haven't been to help this. Yeah.

I haven't done yeah. I should. I haven't used it. I think you no. I think you've spent it last time.

I, I I remember specifically healing down to pray. I know I haven't. There was no time between the last battle and this battle, and I think you used it last battle. I I I I really didn't. I promise you.

I don't I don't remember using it at all last battle. So and if that's the case, then I won't use it, and I will whack him again. I don't think I've used it. The reason why I took all the damage. You just just do what you want, but I really need to keep track of that because I'm certain that you used it last time.

I'm certain that it happened. What it asked, Could remove the focus from the character sheet? Yeah. It did. Okay.

So the focus was added on to like, I saw Clark add the focus back on. So Yeah. And then I stopped because I I am fairly certain I didn't. But that's fine. We'll just go that I did.

Alright. You, successfully you killed the one that was right in front of you. You have more after all. I have I just have one. You just have one?

Yep. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Okay. Alright. Oh, we gotta get One's gonna move down. I'll get to here. Pull out his dog slicer and swing and miss.

Alright. Well, Alwar, you're up. Okay. I need about two more actions. I'd happily give you two of mine.

I will step one. Ten fifteen twenty. Step one. We're gonna move, and we're gonna, say a little prayer to, the cadence as we do. Ten, fifteen, 20.

Okay. This is wall. Correct? Right. Yeah.

I don't have everything walled out, but, but you should be able to tell what's what's wall and what's not. So Okay. I'm going to stop there, and then I will two actions. Can't do that. You've only got 15 left.

He's gonna get to you. Decisions. Decisions. So my thought process is I have a heal. But, Karsten, if I heal you, Tahir is out there, and the big guy's next, theoretically, he could get back to you.

I think he'd have to double move to do it. But I don't see any other goblins. He should probably, heal, what's his face? Here. I mean, that's what I was kind of leaning towards.

But Mhmm. Yeah. You know I think you should. You're not wrong. You should do it.

There may be a third option. That may be the stupidest of all options. No. I think we have to do that. That thing hit for 15 without even trying last time.

It's certainly gonna hit Cahir. Yep. So, yeah, we will cast soothe on Cahir. Boop. Oh, sick.

Good. Five five hit points. Excellent. It's exactly the rule that you needed. Exactly.

And also take the spell effect soothe. I don't know if it's gonna help you, but you never know. And then for my third and final action, we will demoralize the bugbear again. Actually, no. We're not.

I'm lying. I cannot do that. I tried to cheat. I forget. Once you demoralize someone, you can't demoralize them again.

We've never really followed that in my game either because I never thought about it. I wanna demoralize this dude right in front of me because he's probably about to try to slice me like a dog, and I'm not a big fan of that. Roar. I'm intimidating. Right.

Run up to a brandishing my loot. He is super scared. Excellent. Excellent. I'm super scared.

That's me. Alright. Bugbear is indeed going to move in on your air. Oh, yeah. His great sword.

Oh, it's an okay sword. Oh, it's a great sword. Yep. How did I get there? Oh.

How did you get there? I killed those other two people. I was I was next to this guy. I was here. Like, oh, never mind.

I'm sorry. That guy No. I I I did not move you. I promise. Yeah.

So how did I get between those people? Yep. He he runs up behind you, takes out his great sword, and stabs you. Yeah. He does.

The sword goes straight through your chest Whoo. Poking out the other side, and you have dropped. 42 damage? Uh-huh. Yes.

The taste was all better. Mhmm. And then Bugbear is going to move away. Did you heal him, Matthew? What's that?

Did you heal him? I sure did. Yeah. But It didn't matter. Didn't matter.

The the bugbear literally did 42 points of damage Yeah. To him in one swing I got it. Which, for the record, that's the amount of hit points that Cahir has. Oh, right. Even if he was at full range.

Risk for taking me out. I'm going to bed. Problem. You're not dead yet. You're not quite dead.

Should be. Something like that. You're right. The frightened goblin is going to be wide eyed and try to slice you like a monkey. Excellent.

I have a reaction. Oh, okay. I would have a reaction if you requested. What's your reaction? This is also new.

Sorry. There's a lot of new things. Yep. Empathetic plea. Trigger.

You were attacked by a creature. You haven't acted a hostile toward. I have not acted a hostile toward him. Or I see a weird word. Okay.

Before it rolls its attack. Okay. The way you cringe or use a puppy dog eyes when practicing illicit to an empathetic response, attempt a diplomacy check against your attacker's will. Okay. Oh.

Oh. Success. Wow. Yep. Out of success, the creature takes a negative two circumstance penalty on the triggering strike and all it strikes against you until beginning of its next turn.

Alright. Yay. Well, it really missed. Oh, excellent. Okay.

It misses more. Cool. Yep. So I did intend to get a message first. Yeah.

But you can envision what that looked like. Well, you know, it is only a goblin, so it's not really all that, all that, great here. It will try and swing again, and it'll miss again. And then it's gonna run all back, except Amir. Hey.

So you saw that you saw that larger, or that medium sized creature run away. And then the other the other goblin that's a little bit further back, with fear in its eyes tried to stab Alwar a few times, but was also not successful, and it ran away. Or not also, but it was unsuccessful and then ran away. Now you are up. I will get my yeah.

Okay. So I will do a frostbite on said bugbear attempt anyway. So I'm sure you'll get right past that, but that's what he does. And then while that is happening Sorry. Easily gets past that.

Long person. We won't do that. Yep. Desert piece. They'll roll damage.

Yep. Hold to play cap. Make sure I'm in the right spot. There we go. I love those d four.

Alright. Look at that. And then I will move myself to Shaw. I think that's all my moves or actions I ought to say. Alright.

And, Karsten, you're up. I don't really know what to do. I will, I guess, move. I will lap this guy. Yeah.

You did. Ouch. I will, raise my shield. I'll learn. Well, things have certainly taken a turn.

Indeed they have. We will. Question. Mhmm. Here here's sword Rage again.

Yep. Nope. I think my best about to do that. Alright. Step one.

We will sing a last shore courageous anthem. Step two. We will cast our last first little spell of the day, and we will soothe Karsten. And we will not roll a one. No.

That's much better. Much better. Much, much better. Apply healing? Yep.

That was obnoxious. Alright. Now that is me. Alright. I'm sorry.

I'm just doing a quick inventory to see if anyone happens to have any healing potions. So far as I know, it only does. I tried to it looked like Arsha did, but then it said quantity zero. Yeah. Yeah.

I gave mine away because I thought our those people were coming with us. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay.

Well, that's, I that's that's the thing. Okay. The main hit points. That's that's pretty pretty substantial healing there, dude. Mhmm.

That was good. Hang on, buddy. Let me up side. Unless unless he has 42 Probably won't be able to crit you though. Your AC is a lot higher than Cahir's.

That's true. Yeah. So dudes I don't know. I mean, he might still hit you. But so he runs in with his great sword, text.

Does indeed hit you. It is a great sword, but does not crit. Right. He doesn't crit, and he deals seven points of damage as you ward him off. You Yes.

Do you want to do shield block or just keep where he got? What'd you say? You want to shield block this or do you just wanna take it? Shield block. Okay.

Let me go ahead and make that correction. So you have block applied, and now you take the damage. Okay. So your shield absorbs four damage with an additional three making it through to you. So you only take three damage instead of the four Oh.

Instead of the seven. Fantastic. Your shield is at 17 hit points, but you can still raise it and still get the bonuses from it. Excellent day. And then we have a tiny goblin that is going to take his opportunity and try and stab you in the back Another one?

With his dog slicer. Oh my gosh. Are you kidding me? What? I mean, he's gonna get you real good.

I guess. Yeah. He is. I'm blocking my shield. Okay.

Oh, no. No. Does the champion have two reactions? I don't think so. No.

Yeah. Your shoe block only takes it it takes a reaction, so you can only use it once. Perounder. Gotcha. Yeah.

Sorry. No worries. No. No. I think I'm still alive.

Yeah. He is. He is still alive. He's still up. He's he is near death.

Yeah. And, and then the I think he basically, run up here. No fault. What? Little pansy.

Right? I mean, you're regardless of regardless of who you are, unless you rule really really poorly, you are one shouting these goblins. They're not gonna stick around. Damn. You watch too many of their buddies get, turned into paste.

That's what it'll act pretty seriously. Alright. Let's see. Where where is Cahir in this? Because he's he's apparently a dying two.

I don't know what that means, but that's That means he's one more round around he's one more round from or two more rounds from being dead dead. If you don't raise him back up, he's gonna I mean, I can I have medical stuff? I just we gotta kill the thing so I can Right. Right. Somebody somebody healed him, didn't they, though?

No? They healed him before. Yeah. Before he dropped. Oh, unless he stabilizes.

Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Maybe I was misinterpreting the healing.

It was on me. He was It was on you. Yeah. Oh, okay. Yep.

That's where my healing was. Okay. How's the stabilization happening here? You should've been rolling for those. I think it's only, like, one round if I forget where he is in initiative.

Yeah. He's been pulled out of it. So I was after the big guy. It's gone past me once. Oh, but you would have moved to directly before the big guy because he was the guy who knocked him out.

Exactly. So, Scott, what I want you to do, because it it doesn't look like it roll like you rolled a, a recovery tech. So when when right right after Alwar went, I need you to open up your character sheet and look at the and in the hit points area, right next underneath the current hit points, there's a dying section there, and then there's a little d 20 next to it. If you hover over it, it says recovery check. You should roll that.

Oh. Hey. That's actually really good. That's right. That's that's that is good for us.

Good stats. Look at that. That is that is perfect. Okay. So it reduces your dying value by two, which is stable.

That means you're up? No. No. It doesn't mean you're up high. It means he's no longer dying.

He's not going to be he's not going to be, he's not going to be up until he's been healed. But at least at this point, he's not going to be up until he's been healed. But at least at this point, he's not bleeding out on the floor anymore. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Exactly. He's he's he's at least cauterized or clotted a little bit. Don't know how this guy could hit 42 damage trying to add that up. It's like, fuck.

Well, he he's using great sword, which is a d 12. I don't care, Chris. I'm just upset about that. You I'm just upset. It doesn't matter what it looks like.

I'm sure the game did the proper math. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you got stuck at that situation. I was not trying to drop anybody. So, Carson, you are now up.

Oh, no. Wait. Sunir, you're up. You didn't you didn't actually have a have your turn yet. In turn, Lightning bolt someone that little guy.

You want me to lightning bolt the little guy? Or get the big guy dead. Yeah. I would recommend I I would recommend you killing the thing that actually can hit you. Yeah.

Yeah. That's the that's kinda You guys been using a lot of time killing goblins that can't that can't hit you half the time, and this guy always hits whoever he's going after. So stacking. Yeah. He's really good at it.

He is. Alright. So I'm a test frostbite again. K. He's gonna succeed again.

And then Oh, he does he does have the feel of somebody who's got decent fortitude. So Yeah. He has to do defeat. So we'll damage. There.

Okay. That's really messy. And then I will do I can do shield also. Right? That is a one action.

Mhmm. So I will do the shield. Yeah. And just, and and, Jason, just just for, like, strategy wise as spell caster, Generally, what you want to do is find when you're fighting somebody and you're using, and you're using those those sorts of spells, that's different. Different saves that we can use.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, teleconnect projectile could work, but he's got full plate. The electric arc might actually be really good because it's a reflex, and he seems to be a higher fortitude Yep.

Feature. I'm That's I'm not actually giving you yeah. No. I was thinking the same thing, though. Yeah.

So But then again, I think I don't know. You know? I'm so okay. So you cast shield on yourself. Do you have the, I drag the blood magic scale hide over to me?

Or You drag the spell effect shield over to you Okay. And the blood magic scale hide because shield is a iconic spell. So you get your blood magic bonus to it as well. So you get a plus two to your AC whenever you cast shield instead of plus one. Oh, it's for good.

Blend Which is pretty baller. And then on top of that, we have the do we have the, seal on the LR? Yeah. That one's still going too. Right?

That affects the AC? Create a thing at the no. Nope. Just the damage. Okay.

Yep. Okay. Okay. That's my that's my turn. But you do also have it's not gonna be something that you can do right this very minute, but you do also have the mage armor, thing from being of some sort that you could turn on that would also affect your AC.

You don't currently have it up. Correct. Correct. That's a good idea. Yeah.

Alright, Carson. You're up. Hey. Welcome. Clark, just some additional stuff here.

We do have a special lily called Titan Swing that makes you hit harder. You could try to do that as well, which it costs two actions to do your Titan Swing, but, you know, you would be hitting at your best bonus. So there's a chance that you'd be doing extra damage with one hit. Can you use a hero point to re hit if you miss with the Titan Swing? Yeah.

K. I would assume. Alright. Sounds good, Chris. Let's do it.

Alright. So in your character speed character sheet, in your actions menu, there's a Titan Swing, like, checkbox. Check it, and then attack with your win and then attack with your winner zone. Tightens tightens swing? Yeah.

No. Like, in in your actions menu where your attacks are, right above it, there there are some checkboxes. No. Oh, yeah. Yep.

Click on the top and swing checkbox. K. Alright. Now swing with your sword, and it'll automatically add the damage. Oh, gotcha.

Alright. Money. Big money. Boom. It looks like some big money.

What a crap. It is. Right? Holy crap. I don't know.

That sucks. You, you the, the I don't I don't know what you wanna do for, like, the the flare of this, but it's like some but, like, it could be like your arm just starts glowing with the radiant energy of the sun, and you slash into it causing, causing a steering, causing a steering light to, infect the cut into the into the bugbear causing it to reel back in pain. That works for me. I like it. And then I'm going to, should I try to hit again or just raise my shield?

I would recommend raising your shield. You it basically counted as two attacks with that one attack, so you'd be doing your negative negative 10. So you're best at this point. Yeah. Alright.

Alwar, you're up. Alright. We will. I cannot currently see that goblin from where I am because of the wall. Yep.

K. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.

You could move up and def like, if you moved up, you would definitely be able to see it just in your current position. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep.

This is 30 foot. Let's see. Range from here. Okay. Sick.

Alright. Well, Cadence, you haven't failed me yet. We will move, here. Good spot. Try to provide Carson the flank, and we will electric boogaloo, these two goblinoids.

Boop. Alright. But there's first. He fails. Goblin is second.

He passes. Alright. Let's see what we did. Roll that beautiful bean footage. Oh.

Oh my gosh. Not bad. Not bad on two e four. I'll take it. Right.

So the bug bear failed. The goblin took half. Okay. That's great. Both of the creatures get zotted and both look badly injured at this point.

Excellent. It is now the bugbear's turn. Excellent. He he has some pretty tasty options right now. Oh, oh.

Really easy. I think he's gonna target our this time. So swing back around. Excellent. Or flip around and try and see what he can do.

Almost certainly have a more different reaction, but we will see. Did he really miss? Yeah. Alright. Cool.

And, he's gonna try again because Excellent. What's your Alright. Sick. Oh, Cadence is on my side. Hard tank for the win.

What the heck? Right. Right. Like, this guy is wrecking our front liners, and here you are. He's smaller.

He's hard to see. Right. Right. How about nimbly bimbly? Big big sword slow motion.

And he's gonna move up. My gosh. I've invincible. Nice job. Oh, he was gonna one shot me too.

He was. It was gonna be so bad. The goblin is gonna try and shoot Karsten. Miss. Alright.

That's that's back to normal. Again. Miss again. This is what the this is what the goblins do. This is what they're supposed to do.

Right. That credit He's gonna move What? Yeah. Not only was it a crit, it was, like, an almost max damage crit too. Like, it was just, like Yeah.

Yeah. Insanely bad. Alright. Sameer, you're up. I think I can still do this.

I have a I have to explore that later. So dangerous sorcery allows me to is that the one? No. Am I not able to be healed? Like You are.

Or to but no one has anything to heal you. We're we're all just because we gave all of we gave all of the all of the healing potions that I gave you guys specifically so you'd be walking into this with some healing potions. You you gave them to the NPCs. I took two of mine, so I have no excuse. Other than that.

No. Or any two of them. You could have a and you and you did go from one really rough fight into this one too. So, like, I mean, that did not help either. But yeah.

It's definitely not yeah. There there is a confluence of events here. So so no matter whether you, Do I have to do anything in particular to do, like, the reach spell or whatever applied as a feat to to my magic casting? It costs an action to use, but that's it. Okay.

So instead of, like, a two action spell, it'll be a three action spell. Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. I will do that, and then I'll do the So your Arch.

So your reach spelling electric arc. Alright. Yeah. I see that. K.

Goblin's gonna do the save first. My gosh. Succeeds. Alright. Half damage will still probably kill him.

That's fair. And Oh my god. Look at that. Probably won't kill him. They both they both do succeed, but, go ahead and roll damage.

Half. Half. Tattoo damage. Goblin. Still just be alive.

The goblin is near death. Take it off. Alright. Darston, you're up. Ready?

Mhmm. That guy's still alive? Okay. On the bright side, he can't he apparently can't hit you. So, you know, except for that one time.

Doesn't matter. I don't want him to hit me. Right? I am gonna whack him. Can I use my thunder titan again?

Yeah. I think so. Wait. Come on. I can read it.

I can read it. The character calls upon. Radius oh, it didn't do the flat check. Okay. Okay.

Oh, that's not what I want. That's because I didn't do I did the tight swing. Why is it not highlighted? Oh, is it always highlighted? Yeah.

It is until you uncheck it. Oh, oh, perfect. Okay. I'm sorry. I turned something else on.

I apologize. Let me No. I got it. I already shut it off. We're good.

Oh my gosh. I'm gonna reroll that. Zero point? Yeah. I do.

Alright. So right click on it and say reroll with hero point Oh, gosh. In the chat window. Yeah. Yeah.

Okay. I had two hero points, but we really only had one this game. Right? No. I we refreshed, at the hour mark, and everybody should be at two at this point.

Gotcha. Okay. Perfect. I'm waiting for them here. Yep.

Alright. Oh. Do what? There we go. Track of the hero points, so I should be good for that.

That was a solid hit. Roll that damage. Come on. Oh. That's pretty good.

That's enough. Uh-huh. How do you how do you kill said bugbear with your hide and swing? I'm gonna cut its head off with the it'll rub there, swing at me, and he misses, and I chop his head off. Alright.

So you lob its head off and the, resonance of the, of the sun of the sun blade, just kind of engulfs the body and it and it, it burns into cinder, leaving us with Alwer and a very near death goblin. Excellent. Let's see what we can do about that. I have no. No.

I don't. Okay. Let's see if I had anything more fun, but I do not. So we are just going to electric arc him and finish this. Oh, jeez.

Yay. And by that, by being not at all finished this. Holy crap. He quickly succeeds. Yeah.

He does. He just dodges out of the way of your electric arc. Still got some spring in that step. Alright. Cool.

I that's all They've been by that a couple of times. Re up courageous anthem. Mhmm. Alright. That's me.

Okay. So this guy, he's, he may be a goblin, but he's not stupid. Oh, cool. The reaction runs away. Yeah.

It does. Yeah. Well, I don't think there's a whole lot we can do about that. Oh, unless you guys wanna chase after him. I do not.

I need to get over there and roll some heels. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But but here, it's, it's still breathing.

Barely. I will, nonetheless, AKA move and then some do a position over here just as a post. There's not much I can do for it to here. So Yeah. Yeah.

I'll keep eyes on and at least, I can dive before they get to you real quick. Right? Do I have to click on them, Chris? How do I Okay. So we will go ahead and end the encounter, and lots of stuff will happen.

So, Clark, if you're wanting to treat wounds let me just go ahead now to assign that. Don't worry about the lootables later. So if you wanna treat wounds, you need to target, target kit here. Yep. And on your, on the macro bar at the bottom, there's a little yellow plus sign that's treat wounds.

Click on that. And you and, Scott, you can apply the healing that he applied. So now, Tahir is up is alive. That was the first ten minutes that you were that you were doing this for him. I will be refocusing during that ten minutes.

Alright. I assume we're gonna take oh, we're also gonna keep that up because that's just an action. Right. You do also have your light spell still as well, so you can use that if you need to. Oh, that's true.

That is true. We do have a light spell. The the sun one is great for, like, instant light to be, you know, finding yourself in a bad situation as well as being as well as being good if you're, you know, you know, fighting something that does spirit damage. But, your light your light can trip is still better at this point. So That's true.

It does last longer. Mhmm. It's less light, though, notably. It is. It is definitely less light.

So I guess it's kind of a trade off. But Yeah. Yeah. I'm assuming we're gonna spend more time, so I'm gonna focus again. Yeah.

So minutes. Yeah. And, Clark, at this point, you can choose to refocus, and, start doing lay on hands if you want to or or what have you. Yes, please. And for Kahir, I'm gonna go ahead and pull you out of Kron.

And since you were actually success since you had a successful healing check on you, your your wounded condition does also go away. So that's one of the good things about actually doing a healing check versus just a healing spell. The wounded condition doesn't go away with the with the healing spell. But with but if somebody actually rolls healing, it actually removes the wounded condition. So, as as you guys are kind of piddling through the, you know, how do I heal to here?

Thought I cast a hang on. Yep. There we go. We want to move back to the opening while we take what is probably gonna be a couple hours to do this. Yeah.

It will. I don't mind moving back. Yeah. I don't see a reason to post this position if we don't need to stay here. Yeah.

Yeah. I mean, to get them up, great, but, all of this healing is gonna take us A while. A while. Yep. Yep.

So I don't know if we actually need to move on the map or not. I don't I don't know if anything's gonna happen, but, but, yeah, maybe somewhere a little more defensible just in case we do get we're getting wrecked. Alright. Well, I was thinking then. That's kinda lame.

To have done that differently. Mhmm. And so you guys moved back to the back to the entrance. As you are oh, that would be nice. As you're rummaging through the bodies, you find Kirsten, you better heal yourself.

Alright. You find a, a lot of booty. So, there are the dog slicers and short bows and leather armors that you get from all of the all the goblins, but, you know, those are just standard stuff, nothing all that special. The, the nice stuff that you have across is there is indeed a great sword and a full and a suit of full plate armor that you have. Excellent.

I think I know someone who might want some full plate. I have no idea what you're talking about. While while the barbarian while the barbarian might want full plate, he is not proficient in full plate. So That's true. That does actually still fall still fall on the, the champion.

Yes, please. So, I have I've basically dropped a a a loot thing on the table. So if you wanna rummage through it, pull out what you want to pick what you wanna keep. I don't see anything on any table. A chest here, though.

Oh, I see. Sorry. Not here. I can't open suggest. There we go.

Yeah. As far as who wants the great sword, I'm not really sure who would want that, but Not me. Full plate. That seem that seem kinda nice. Yeah.

What do I have? Not full plate, do I? Shame. Yeah. Yeah.

So I'll give you a little better AC. Where do I drag it in the equipments? There we go. Yeah. You just drag it onto your character, and it should drop in your drag it onto your pocket.

It should drop it into your inventory. But Oh, oop. I did great sword. Can I put it back? Alright.

Yeah. Yeah. You can put it back. There we go. There we go.

Wow. Then all you need to do is, change, change its carry type to being worn and remove the chain mail, and you weren't good. How do you change it to worn? Oh, I see. Never mind.

Never mind. How do you how do you change it to worn? You see the little shirt in the on the Oh, I got it. Okay. I got it.

It had two had two warrens. Yeah. My AC didn't seem to change. Oh, it did by one? Let's see here.

Looking at the modifiers, you have a zero bonus from dexterity. You have a plus four bonus from being trained, a negative one clumsy status, and the full plane is plus six. So the clumsy where's that coming from? Zero perpardon? They're encumbered.

So if you want your AC to go up, then you need to drop some weight. Yep. Can I put some stuff in a backpack in that account or no? Depends on what you can fit in your backpack. I mean, I have, like, a bedroll or a torch or a healers kit, climbing kit.

Can I put that in my backpack? Yeah. I think the backpack, you can't alleviate some weight. You just gotta move stuff into the backpack, like your old chain mail that you can probably put in your backpack. Yep.

And that's just, like, clicking and dragging in there. Yeah. There you go. Hey. Now we have an AC.

Now you're not clumsy. Yeah. Now you have a starting AC of 20, and if you raise your field, it'll be 22. Yeah. Okay.

It was pretty good. That's pretty good. Alright. And we are, again, at another hour, so everybody gets another hero point. So most of you are maxed out at this point.

Alright. One thing I've noticed with my character is I don't actually roll a lot of d twenties. Is that the only time that you can use it is on a d 20? Yep. Yep.

Any a a d 20 role. Yeah. So skill check, ability check, or attack role. Yep. Yeah.

I make other people roll d twenties. Yes. Alright. Say that again? Oh, I was just saying I make other people roll d twenties.

But Mhmm. Okay. So, you're healing people up. Right? I have no idea what I'm doing.

Yes. You're healing people. Yeah. Actually, the if the heal spell potentially has or not the heal spell, but the And I'm healing. Has more heal potential than the heal.

Does that make sense? Your your medicine skill does, but the thing with the medicine skill is you can only use it once per hour on each person. So it's definitely good to start off with your medicine skill to, you know, give a good resurgence, but you're probably gonna find yourself also wanting to use lay on hands as well just to kinda top people off. Yep. Medicine skills, like, at 100%, you're healing better with the medicine skill than with your focus spell.

Alright. So I'm focusing, I guess. Mhmm. And, so you can heal I think you can do your medicine skill on like, you can do your medicine skill on Sameer, on Auer, and yourself as well. Oh, yeah.

Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. I I'd start with that and then just start using Leon Hands to supplement when once you're once you've actually healed everybody. I'd like a little healing.

I mean, you don't even need any healing. Did you do anything? He does. He does need healing. I got laxed.

I probably have an arrow shaft stuck in my chest somewhere. It's just barely injured. Barely injured. Barely injured, but he only has 19 hit points left. Still 20% of my hit points gone.

Did you Yeah. Did you see did you see the bugbear that did 42 points of damage in one hit? I did. Samir has 24 points damage. Oh, Jason.

I know. I got hero points. I do have hero points. Oh, yeah. What do you have to do?

Oh, gosh. Marn it. I messed that up. You have to roll for what? I don't know what I'm looking for.

Park has Park has the medicine skills training, which is not a wolf medicine skills. K. I think that's it's still 12. Right? I think that still does it.

But What? Is it 16? Clark, use Clark, use the treat wounds, option rather than just rolling straight up medicine, in the future just because that's it'll be a little bit messy. Roll the hue. It's the button that I asked you to click when you were healing to hear.

The the plus sign button in the bottom in the Let let me redo that. No. You you succeeded. You passed. We just need to we just need to roll 2D8 now and then I and then give that to and then Samir, you get 2D8 healing.

How do I how do I roll 2D8? In the bottom of the chat, there's a, there's a d eight button. Hit your click that twice and hit enter. Oh, man. What if I need to go down one?

Oh, I hit it. Hit enter. Well, I click on the click on the chat window and then hit enter or hit roll button. I'm sorry. There's a roll button at the bottom right hand corner.

I'm glad to give you instructions. Alright. So meter, you heal pin. Nice. Sweet.

There we go. Hit this little thingy. Oh, okay. Oh, snap. Much easier it is when you use the thing?

Yeah. So outward, you heal 15. Oh. And I'm gonna do how do I how do I click on me? Right click on yourself, and then there's a and there's a little target.

There there's a little a number of buttons that come around your portrait, and there's a little target. Click on the target. That's why. Okay. That is the way that I target everybody.

So that one, I know how to do it. I don't use my thing. These are beads. Did you reroll with a did you reroll with the hero point? Oh, every time.

I wanna spend it. Sorry. Yes. But no. There we go.

Alright. So you heal 12 points of damage yourself. Okay. Now you probably wanna start using delay on hands. We can just kinda speed that up here.

Good idea. I'm I'm assuming that every that you're just gonna be pinging everybody until they're full up. Right? Yeah. Which is just, here and me.

Everyone else is good. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. So that ten minutes of pop, six six And pops do we need?

Alright. So that takes you the better part of an hour and a half for you to get everybody healed up. As Karsten is doing that, is there anything that anybody else wants to do other than, like, just kinda guard the inference? I will, I will take, the time and just, focus, I guess, for lack of better terminology for the gangs. So I don't have any I didn't use any focus spells or anything, I don't believe.

So You have focus spells, but you just have I don't think I used any. Yeah. So I don't need it for that purpose. Okay. Is anybody investigating the cave that you're in, or you're just kinda huddling huddling up there until everybody's fresh and then deciding to start investigating?

Or you're just gonna hang out at the entrance? I figured we would investigate after we had full health. But Okay. Maybe. Sounds like Maybe maybe while we're I'm doing that, other people are investigating.

You guys are just working again. Yeah. Once I peeled the full, I can pop around, kind of investigate a little bit on the inside. I'll try and get bored. That's not the bar.

Right? Yeah. I would accompany our, so I'm still healing, so I would assume it's in the hour and a half. Yeah. Yeah.

I mean, I'm not gonna go far. I'm gonna just kinda investigate. I'm serious about this there's a bit of a tunnel down here, it looks like, maybe. Yep. Yeah.

Okay. So not going far. You, yeah. So you I'll go there. So so you basically walk in there and, again, you know, it's it's more of a rough a rough hewn tunnel.

Part of it looks like it might have been widened out by tools, but for the most part, it looks like it's a natural cave. Yeah. There is a, there's there are some steps that go up to a tunnel to the south. There are some steps that go up to a tunnel to the west, and there's, a few ledges that lead to an alcove to the north. Very clear in this, in this area that this was an excavation site.

There are a number of, broken picks and and and axes and and different pickaxes and that kind of thing too, that were used. The tunnel that you're in, does have a little bit of bracing on it, although not a ton. And, again, you know, you see the evidence of explosives, but you do not see any actual explosives themselves. House so you guys were looking down the, the the tunnel to the south. The tunnel to the south does start to curve, to the west, and you didn't quite get so far down that you were, that that you followed that to its, to its conclusion.

But it, it definitely does appear to go further than what you, than what you had seen. The tunnel to the west, as you get a little bit further down, you start seeing some green light emanating from that from that area. Right. But, nothing but sounds cool. Yeah.

Green dim light is basically what you see. Mhmm. Any, any specific questions or things that you might be looking for? I'm not really gonna go too much further than that. I'll maybe look at able to distinguish maybe the the tracks of the whatever that one bear Mhmm.

From the from the others? Yeah. I mean, it's it's pretty it's pretty easy to discern the the tracks of the bugbear versus the tracks of the goblins. The bugbear's feet are definitely, about twice twice to three times the size of, of goblin feet. So, you you I just wanna know if it was if there was enough surface dust or dirt or whatever for that to be possible.

Yeah. There are definitely tracks there. Go ahead and roll a survival for me. It's not there. W r.

That's gonna be decent. Right. That seems pretty good. So what you're able to determine from the tracks that you found, You see the goblin tracks and the bugbear tracks were primarily, going up and were going along the the path of the southern, of the Southern Tunnel. The tunnel that has the green light doesn't appear to have many tracks, if any, at all.

As a matter of fact, once you get about ten, fifteen feet into that tunnel, the only tracks that you're able to identify are the tracks of the goblin that was running that direction. Okay. That's good to know. I'll communicate such to, Alwar as we're wandering around here. Seem to all be coming from the South.

So of the directions maybe that we want if we're trying to head in you know, get into the head of this thing, then it looks like maybe the South is the way to go. Okay. That green light was coming from the West, though? Right. Yeah.

Okay. That's that's its own point of curiosity. Yeah. Agreed. Nice.

K. So, yeah, here, after having been knocked out and being brought back to, being brought back to consciousness, what what what are what are you feeling at this point? What's your existential crisis? How are you feeling today? Do you need some counseling?

You you're not used to things hitting as hard as you do. Right? Right. Yeah. I don't know what I'm feeling.

I don't know what you mean by it. What am I supposed to be feeling? I'm just happy to be alive Or just wondering Good. What was that thing? He was not much bigger than a goblin, but how did he hit that?

Hard. Yeah. Maybe Oliver could explain why the big bear man, whatever they call him. Didn't he do a check on that? Like, how did he pierce through my chest?

Rest bone of righteousness. No. I'm ready. I wanted to be able to hit him when I died. So that's I'm feeling frustrated because all I think about is killing the bad big bad guys, see how much damage I can do.

Yep. My plan was thwarted by a 42 damage. Okay. It was it was a very good hit. So It's it's approaching the top end of his limits.

Be humble. But, no, like, I I I'm only asking that, Scott, just because, like, you know, it it's I'm just curious how you think that how you think Keir would be dealing with the situation that he's that he's found himself in. So, I think he'd be very happy. I thought that was a Wonder why there's no ability to stop anything. He go cry to his brother.

Said he should have been a full orc. Cursed by this human weakness. Right. Yeah. That was a that was a close one, Elwar will say.

I thought I thought he had you there. You're, you're too young to go that easy. I'm glad he made it. Me too. Me too.

Gonna be happy to be alive. I don't think he'd be afraid to go after him. I think he would just be figuring out what to do differently. Yep. Well, yeah.

Anyway try out that Titan swing. I really wanted to try the Titan swing. Yeah. Yeah. Karsh can beat you to it.

But, and just kind of in the aftermath, like, as you're, like initially, you're just kind of focused on getting everybody healed up and everything happening. Alwar and and Samir, you guys are doing a little bit of scouting. But over but over the course of the next couple of hours, as no additional forces come as you're as you're building out, you start to wonder what's going on, and, you know, what to do and what to do next. So, what, what direction do you think that you're you're going to want to go? Well, that's a good question.

Apparently, Sameer says that the, majority of traffic looks like it's coming from the South, but our lone survivor scuttled off to the west. There's this weird green light coming from over there. So I'm kinda curious about that. Yeah. I am too.

So the one to the south looks like it's lower. Is that correct, Chris? Like, it's goes down into the earth? No. Actually, the, the clearing area that you're right in right now is the highest point.

So or the lowest point. I'm sorry. So everything goes up towards, so the the the, south has basically some ledges that are effectively, like, low gradient steps that go up, and same thing with the with the tunnel to the with the tunnel to the the west. So, like, if there was water flowing, it would all be flowing into the area that you're in. So the guys could have been coming from above, which means could they be back at the temple area?

It's possible. You did not see any additional points of egress when you were there. So, unless they unless they, unless they had a different area that they were, making a hole in there for, you're pretty certain based off what you saw in in your last battle. You're pretty certain that you're not gonna have a you're you're they're they're not doubling back around to attack the temple in a different spot. K.

I'd like to just decide for you. Alright. Sounds like we got three votes for green. Go for it. Alright.

So you guys, you guys definitely or you guys decide that you wanna wanna start moving in that direction. And as as you're moving around in this in this map, just, you know, again, for the record, like, I don't like, the the cave walls don't have any, like, walls for you to run into. This is this is basically all free open map, but I'm just trusting that you guys will stick with stick inside the walls. Yeah. Yeah.

I just don't wanna I I didn't wanna put in a bunch of it takes a while to set up the walls, and on top of that, sometimes people get stuck in weird things. And so I figured, we're all adults. We can treat this like a regular battle map. So that's what we're doing. So you start moving towards, towards the wall or or towards the green green light.

O'Rourke is the is the beacon of light at the moment. So you guys all try and stay pretty close to him, as you're moving. Yeah. Well, not that I've got some time, I guess. There's no reason I can't.

Alright. Am I am I correct here? Light cam trip. Works on everyone. Yeah.

Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yeah.

There's no reason I won't just light everyone. Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool.

Oh, yeah. Make make everybody a light. I just can't actually do that because I don't think I can put things on there. Yeah. Well, if you can cast the spell.

Yep. Yep. Yeah. If you can cast the light canter, if I can at least drop it on people or they can drop it on themselves. There we go.

So everybody grab the spell effect light and drop it onto your token. Hey. Oh, it's bright in here. Everybody's lit up. Well, I don't know if they would surprise, but for that new clanky armor, I don't know if we have that anyway.

Yeah. Right? Alright. So you start you you start moving down the tunnel. Again, Sameera is definitely something that you noticed in that tunnel.

There isn't a whole lot of, there isn't a whole lot of tracks in there. So it definitely does seem like the la like, the most the most recent, goblin running this direction was, like, kinda the last person or the the last person that's been here at least for a few weeks minimum, if not longer. Really? As you get further in, you start seeing this green ghostly light that starts emanating from, from an opening at the end of the tunnel. And this tunnel is, again, roughly hue this this tunnel is 100% natural, natural tunnel.

There's been no tooling. There's been nothing that's been done on this thing. It is for sure its own its own thing, and natural occurring naturally occurring tunnel. As you guys continue on further in, you you see the opening to, to a larger area. That, that area has some rock formations that act as, like, steps that go further down.

So it it starts descending, down a little bit. Not a drastic amount. It's it's like, you know, maybe a drop of about 15 feet over the span of, like, 30 yards. You know? It's a pretty slow gradient.

But, when you do make it to the mouth of the cave Carson, keep up. Carson, let's go. I just need to grab people and pull them to the mouth of the cave. Oh, I always let the beefcakes go first. I am.

Trying. There. As you get to the mouth of the cave, you notice two things. Well, actually, you notice a lot more than two things. A wall of darkness.

You're right. You do see the wall of dark yeah. No. You don't see the wall of darkness. I've yet to reveal what you see.

But at the bottom of at the bottom of the hill, or at the bottom of the down of the downgrade, you see the goblin that ran away, its body, its body left by the edge of a large lake. Right. On that lake, you see a number of different, boulders, that are coming out out of the lake as if they were, like, small, small islands. They're not, like, small. They're not small as in, like, you know, a boulder that you just hop, skip, and you jump across the lake.

You know, those thing those are things. They're, like, five foot sections of rock that come out come up out of the water. Here, you specifically well, everybody. Everybody sees a person, on one of the more chained in one of the closer boulders in the, in the lake. It is a deep and it is a large lake.

And let me go ahead and just kinda open things up here a little bit. You see a person in the closest the closest boulder over here. All of you recognize her, but, Kahir, you have the strongest connection. What you see is your sister changed to a rock in the middle of the, in the middle of the lake. And she cries out to you, here, save me.

And that is where we will end it for today. Wow.
