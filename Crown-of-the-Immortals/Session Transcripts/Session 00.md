So and there are some additional things that I'll be going over here before we actually get into character creation. Nothing too serious here. I just wanna kinda give you guys a little bit of a background about what you're building your character into. Like, you know, some just overall setting stuff, to be able to build be able to build your character, and then we'll get into character creation. And who knows?

Maybe if we're, like, super speedy and we get through everything really quickly, we'll be able to start the start the first adventure. I get it seventy thirty that that's actually gonna happen. 70 being That's generous. Not smartest. First adventure.

I was gonna say 30 to three. You never know. Stranger things could happen. Mhmm. But okay.

So before we get before we get going, I'm going to, I have a write up. I'm gonna read it to you guys, but I'm also gonna post it in the chat, so you can reread it at your own leisure. And then we will get things going. Sounds good. I can paste.

Alright. You were once a proud citizen of the blessed you you were once a proud citizen of the blessed realms realm. Never thinking of your king's power would ever waver or would ever wane. But eventually, a shadow grew in your heart. You started to doubt the divine right that you thought the blessed realm had.

But did your but did your best to ignore that again. Then one day, a man by the name of Jared came into your town. He was a priest from the capital of Loom, of Lumopolis. He spoke of an a impending duty. He spoke about how we needed to leave the blessed realm to travel north or we would be caught up in destruction.

Whether his words spoke to this unsettled feeling you already had about the king's intentions or you got caught up in his past passionate speech. You decided to leave your life in the blessed realm and travel north to build a community away from the devastation. Jared led the community north. As you were leaving the blessed realm, the flaming retribution occurred. Fire and flaming rocks falling from the sky, earthquakes shattering villages and cities, and boiling geysers erupting everywhere.

It appeared that the very land of Etheria had rejected the blessed realm. The very landscape itself changed in what seemed to be overnight. A year later, the community has settled in a newly created River Fork in the plains. They have worked diligently to build the community over the past year and deal with the dangers of the new work the dangers that the new world brought. They have finally settled into a less volatile place and are now wondering what happens what happened to the rest of the world.

And I am noticing a great number of, misspellings, but, you know, we'll deal with that. Oh, well. I have a computer, so it does the spelling for me, then I just don't listen to it. No. So that's basically kind of where where the setting of where your character is.

Your character doesn't necessarily have to be a member of the blessed realm. It doesn't have to be a citizen. Could be coming from a different place, but that's the overarching, that's the overarching, like, starting area that you're in, is this new, this new village that was created, and, is basically a bunch of refugees from the blessed realm who are trying to figure out what, what's what's up, what's going on. Any questions about that? No, sir.

Okay. Didn't imagine that there would be, but I figured I'd ask just in case. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

Okay. So as far as character creation is concerned, there is some pretty interesting things that you can do, from character create from a character creation standpoint here. You Pathfinder has a number of different, what they call heritages, which are the d and d races or species. You've got those, and then within that, you have, a sub within that, you have a sub species, which is called your lineage. So, like, you know, so you could for instance, you could play a goblin, but, there there are about five four or five different types of goblin that you could play.

One would be, you know, one is an ice goblin, another one is a razor tooth, and it's basically just kind of like where you're from, kind of dictates some of your unique abilities. The before I get before I get too deep into this, do want to say that we do have a, in in Pathfinder character creation is, they they call it, you know, they call it the ABCs. You know, it's as simple as ABC. You have to pick your ancestry, you have to pick your background, and you have to pick your class. So a, b, c.

Then from there, we also add additional ability modifiers, on top of that. Each race that you choose will affect your ability modifiers. Each background that you choose will affect your ability modifiers, and your class will affect your ability modifiers. Each class has a specific ability, has a specific ability that is, that that is their primary attribute. Or yeah.

Each attribute is each class has a primary attribute, which is your biggest and most important ability score. The common wisdom when building character here, well, as far as ability scores are concerned, you start off with a plus zero, which is, everybody has a plus zero. Then, your ancestry will affect your your pluses. They'll give you two, the a lot of them will most of them will give you two pluses, two ability scores that give you a plus one or, and one that gives you a negative one. So it kind of like your your your, ancestry kind of affects that.

Your background will give you, will give you two plus two plus one ability modifiers on top of that. Then your, class will give you a plus one ability modifier, and then your, and then you get additional ability boost. The reason why I'm saying that is the common wisdom is find your primary ability modifier and max it out. So you can get a plus four on your primary ability modifier, building your character this way. But it's by no means a requirement.

If you wanna have a more well rounded character where you have, you know, where you have a bunch of twelves, couple of couple of fourteens and 16, you can totally do that. But there's no there's no reason why you couldn't have an 18 and still be able to have a more well rounded character. Like, I think my, my character in Ramsey's game, has a plus four a plus four in strength, a plus one in Dex, a plus one in Con, a plus three in int, and a plus zero and a a plus zero in both wisdom and charisma. So you can get a pretty good spread even if you are maxing out one of your one of your attributes. The difference between this and D and D, as you guys may have noticed in the, in the beginner box for those of you who play D and D, is that, we do not have ability score.

We don't have ability scores. We only have ability modifiers, and that's a recent change in Path line. There was a remaster that came out about a year ago and, or was announced about a year ago, came out about six months ago, that basically got rid of, ability scores, so you don't have this weird thing where you've got a 10 in ability score and a plus zero modifier, an 18 in ability score, and a plus four modifier. You just have the modifiers you have to worry about. Okay.

So all that being said, that's that's the big overarching spiel. Before we actually get into the nitty gritty, I am just curious. I've got some I'm pretty sure I know what about half the group is playing on playing, and I don't know what the other half the group is playing on playing. I have some inclinations, but not, not the exact understanding. So, why don't we go ahead and just start off with everybody just kinda, letting us know kind of what class you're thinking about, and then we'll go from there.

So I'll just call everybody out individually so we don't have this weird talking over each other business. Mhmm. So, we'll start with the ones that I know. So, Scott, where are you playing? You are muted.

You are hard muted. Hard mute. There we go. Barbarian. Barbarian.

I'm gonna stick let's keep it simple. Yep. Okay. Cool. Clark?

I'm gonna play a champion. Yeah. Awesome. Jason. You not decided yet?

No. I I would I I think I would still like to mess around with the, I was going to go wizard or sorcerer. Okay. And I think maybe still the sorcerer. Okay.

I am shocked, but we we can tell you. Are you shocked? Why What what is shocking about this? You never played an arcane spell. Yes.

It's not a monk or a ranger. Yeah. It's not a monk or a ranger. Right? It's not a monk or a ranger.

Gosh. I really I really would like a ranger. No. Really would like one. But no.

No. We're gonna do You're gonna stretch yourself. Alright. Yeah. Alright.

And, Ramsey, what what are you thinking? So with all of that in mind, it helped me narrow down a little bit because I was between, you know, bard, cleric, druid, psychic, witch. Tell him that. I think I am down to between barred, cleric, Druid. Okay.

Some of those things. I thought you said you narrowed it down. Well, I did narrow it down. I did. I eliminated it.

They're off the list. Kineticist is still on that list too, but I'm not being much lower down. I'm almost certainly gonna just make a Bard. Okay. That's kind of where I've where I've been mostly.

So I think we're just gonna stick with it. That will work. Okay. So in order for us to start character creation, we can do this very easily in, in Foundry. I've given everybody here the the ability to create actors.

So you should be able to create your own character right along with us. So, what you need to do, first thing is first, is go to the upper the upper right hand corner where the chat is, and go find the person in in that chat and click on that, and that'll open up your app actors tab. Where it says Clarkypoo, Pathfinder? Where are you going? If you are if you are logged in to pathfinder, I I'm sorry.

Is everybody logged in? I'm in pathfinder. Okay. Sorry. Yeah.

The crown of the immortals is the name of the, campaign that we're gonna be playing. So You can change the name later. Right, Chris? What's that? I can change the name later?

Yes. Absolutely. Cool. So One sec. If you, go to where that person is, you click on the create actor button.

It's going to give you some options where you've got an option of adding in a name, adding it, making selecting the type, which for you is player character, and then selecting the folder. At this point, don't don't worry about selecting a folder because once you've actually completely created your character, I'm going to go ahead and then and move them into the party folder, which is a special actor folder in in Foundry that's unique to player characters. So, let me know. Right. So fill this out.

Well, there there's some stuff that you need to do. It works it works differently. It's not just it's not just fill in the blank as far as that sort of stuff is concerned. So where you are right now, if you're on your character sheet, we remember, we wanna do ancestry, background, and class. That's how we wanna handle this.

So what you wanna do is you wanna click on the magnifying glass next to your ancestry. When you click on that Oh, come on. Slow down. Okay. Slow and down.

We start. Oh. Oh, so it's hard. I got a name. Picking anything from the drop downs there.

I'm out. Where are you at? I'm at a pause game. You know where your chat is? Yes.

Okay. Up there, there's a little person in there. Ah, yes. Click on that person. After these things, I don't have a clue.

Then what? A a Shoony? What the Yeah. So a Shoony actor. Yeah.

So we'll we'll we'll go over that here pretty soon. Bye. Am I getting away? I have the night. I'm gonna be off to No.

No. You're in the right spot. Yeah. Okay. Yep.

Just waiting for our time to be able to finish up this character creation. So so just add in the name of Clark and then collect create and then create after. Alright. Here we go. Now we should have, like, a green thing that says ancestry and magnifying glass and all that.

Boom. Exactly. I did it. Mhmm. Alright.

So we got everybody with a character sheet. Awesome. That's that's that's great. Alright. So, hey, Clark.

Yeah. Your character's middle name cannot start with a k, just so you know. Fine. Those initials are not allowed. K k.

It could be a c, though. You know? Could be a That that that could be c. C. That's five.

Just not not another k. Yeah. As long as you have a third one, we're okay. Is or something. Well, I feel bad because his middle name's Kyle.

Kyle with a c. My pastor is Kyle with a c. I have no idea that Kyle with a c. Alright. So if you've got your character sheet open, go ahead and click on the, the magnifying glass next to ancestry.

And you'll have a bunch of different ancestries. Which are your which are your races. It can be an Android? Yes. So basically, effectively, what there there are a ton of them in here.

One of the things that I will let me, let me go ahead and open up. Oh, this is cool. There there are some online resources, though, that'll help you kinda understand what some of these are if you wanna try something out. There are some that are obvious. Right?

So lizard folk, orc, rat folk, sprite ping, sprite elf elf orc kobel. Those are all, self explanatory. But then there are things like the Shuni, which are a which are the very good boy people. They're they're a bunch of dog folks. There are, you know, there's the Strix, which are more of a more of a, it's kind of like a skeletal bird people and that kind of thing.

So I'm going to send you a link in Gilded if you're wanting to kind of if you don't have an ancestry in mind and you're basically wanting to check things out, then you'll be able to at least What does it do? What does the Ancestry do? It gives you it does a couple of things. So your Ancestry will give you the, will will give you ability score boosts in specific areas. They also have their own they also have their own feet trees.

So depending on which ancestry you play, you you get access to to certain special abilities and that kind of thing. So some ancestry lend them lend themselves to, certain classes over others and that kind of thing. Or sometimes it's fun to play an ancestry that is not that that's, like, not conducive with what you would think that class is. Like a Sprite Barbarian, you know, that would be kind of fun and clever, but it might not be the most optimal choice. But it's still it's still fun to play with.

You know? How do I select it? So what you do is you click and drag it onto your character sheet. Wow. Click and drag.

Click and drag. Hey. That was hard. You did it. Good job.

You done it. I don't see the help Chris offered. I it's coming. K. I googled, and it said, oh, human, gnoll, lizard fork, or work was the best for the barbarians.

Anyone agree? Not agree. K. Copy. That's interesting.

Okay. So the link that I just sent you, it's kinda it it's just got some pictures to go along with them with the ancestries, and, you know, you can click in to get to dig in deeper with them with them as well. Made it easy for myself. You just went human? Yes.

I'm shocked. Clark is playing I know you are. A human I know. Champion. I know.

What? I know. Do they have a half elf option? They they do. Half elves are actually it's kind of an interesting thing.

So the heritage is, so you can be a half elf half anything at in this in this game. So you have a base ancestry that you pick. So if you wanted to be a traditional half elf, you'd pick it you you'd pick human, And then you pick the half elf, the half elf heritage, and that and that pull and that pulls in some elven some elven stuff in there. You wouldn't do it the other way around? Choose elf and then pick human heritage?

I don't know. I'm a pain. Okay. Let me let me see here. Okay.

Here. I'm not sure, but that doesn't mean that's not so the so the half or or the the half things, they have dhampir, which are vampire types. Which ones? What? Dhampir.

So you can be you can be a vampire something. They're not full vampires, but they're, like, kind of like that. There's a beastkin, which, you know, is more of a Uh-huh. More of a shifter style thing. Changeling, aphorite, which is, what is that?

And the half elf is actually a Ioverrin. They they don't use the half elf term because that's a DMD term, and it Right. Right. And it's an SRD thing, but the the actual, half elf lineage, or heritage is Ieuver and they also do half orcs. I kinda wanna be a half orc.

How do I do that? Same way as, same way as a half elf. So you pick a base, you you pick a base heritage, and then you, and then you grab the half orc or you you pick a base ancestry, and then you you and then you pick the the, half orc, heritage, which is pull that up here real quick. Human? The half orc is the Dromar heritage.

And heritages are basically, those are those are the, like, you know, if you weren't if you wanted to play an ice an ice goblin, that there's an ice goblin heritage. So if I pick orc for my ancestry heritage, there is no such thing as what you said. Well, yeah. So if you pick, orc for your are you wanting to play an orc, or are you wanting to play a half orc? Half orc.

Okay. So you'd have to pick a different you'd have to pick a different a different ancestry than orc. And then your heritage, you'd be picking up the Dromar heritage. Oh, are we gonna move are we moving to heritage now? Well, the ancestry and heritage go pretty close together.

So So so sorry, Chris. Yep. Setting up the half elf, I would pick elf. Is that what I would pick for the ancestry? No.

Your ancestry would be some other race, and then you would pick the So pick human and then go to heritage. Yep. And pick what one? Iuvarin, a I u v a r I n. A Oh, I get it.

You. Do not see any AIU in heritage. Yeah. There's no Duar Mar either. Okay.

So let me let me jump on the character sheet and grab see if I can see if I can figure it out here. You drop. Okay. Ancestry human. Click on the little thing next to heritage.

Okay. Okay. So where you wanna go is in once you click on the, the magnifying glass next to heritage, you wanna go down you wanna scroll down to the bottom and there's a versatile heritages option. You click on that Mhmm. And that's where you that's where your r IULR and or your drum are.

Yeah. Okay. I see that now. Thank you. My goodness.

Yeah. No problem. Woah. Nephilim. Oh, great.

They have Nephilim. Yeah. So in the, in the, in in pathfinder, a Nephilim is a person who has either angelic or or demonic blood. So instead of having an ASMR or a, or a tiefling, they all just fall in the same category as Nephilim. So it's just a a planar a partial planar person.

Partial planar person? Alright. I'm at background. Could be a butcher. Okay.

So background is gonna be a little bit of a little bit of a schlog here. Just so you know, there are billion backgrounds. So that's why I'm saying it's a little bit of a schlog. So if you move into background and you click on that, you will see a billion different backgrounds. And it'll be really hard for you to find exactly what you're looking for unless you have something in mind and you wanna search for.

It. My suggestion would be going to the archives of Memphis into the into the background section, and I can send the link to that. I don't know. The compendium packs? Yeah.

It's it's actually, like, if you go into the in the, if you're looking at if you're looking for the link to archives of Memphis, you're looking for the down in the macro section. There's a purple button that looks like it's got a little scroll on there. That'll open up archives in Memphis. But I will also, I'm also going to give you guys a link to it in in Gilded so you can go on go go on there. You did the ancestors.

Right? I'm sorry. What was that part? Oh, then you did the ancestors. See that link?

Yep. So I'm just sending it now. So that's your backgrounds. If you go in there, you can filter your backgrounds by attribute boosts or by, skills that you wanna pick up or by, specific traits. So, like, that's kinda how I how I would do it.

Because otherwise, you're basically just looking at a a huge amount of backgrounds. Unless you have something, like, in mind where you're like, I want to have been a detective in my previous life, or I want to have been a blacksmith in my previous life, or I want to Hi. Here's mine, Chris. Are you ready? Blacksmith?

No. Oh. I'm a, I'm a warrior for the or the background is training in the, realm of the blessed as a fighting warrior for evil, not for evil, for good, but against evil. I don't know where that is in there. Yeah.

Probably a lot. Holy warrior. Holy warrior. If there is a holy warrior option, that sounds like kinda what you would be looking at. Holy moly.

I could be a clown. Yeah. You could be there there are tons. Tons and tons and tons. Alright.

Gladys. So I chose my class. It says, hey. Pick a bloodline. Yep.

I chose my bloodline. Now I have 500 types of dragons. Yeah. How how do I know what How do I know what one's what? Okay.

So I'm I take it you're doing sorcerer then? Yeah. Yeah. That was the goal. K.

And your bloodline is draconic? Mhmm. K. So in here, what you're basically gonna be looking at, is this is a combination. Like, there are the traditional dragons.

The The chromatic dragons. That are in here. And the and I believe that there are metallic dragons in here as well. I see brass and bronze. Yeah.

So those would be your good good dragons. Yeah. So you've got those ones. Now on top of that, pathfinder has basically been the way that their magic system was working, they're they they don't really have they don't really follow the chromatics very well. So they've created their they've created a new line of dragons as well, which is what the cloud dragon, the sky dragon, the underworld dragon, the forest dragon Uh-huh.

The brine dragon, all those ones are. Honestly, I don't really know exactly what to tell you for which bloodline to choose. I would say that probably if there's one that isn't a chromatic or a, or a metallic that looks interesting to you, just go ahead and pick that one. But if you, if you don't have, or but if you wanna go with what you know, then definitely you can totally pick a metallic or a chromatic dragon. And those things do the same thing that they always did.

So, you know, the, so the red is a fire dragon, the gold is a fire dragon, the the white is a cold dragon, the blue is a cold dragon, The silver is a cold dragon. The green is an acid. The black is a Black was acid. Okay. The green was whatever the green was.

Guys, am I maybe I'm wrong. Yeah. I think, green and black may have both been. They could have been. I know that, like, half of the good dragons are all fire dragons, like copper, brass, and Mhmm.

Gold are all fire. So but if there's something else in here that looks kinda interesting like the brine dragon, that's kind of like a that's like a water dragon. Yeah. The cloud dragon I hear is kinda cool. If you wanna go full on, like, full on fire, you know, magma, seems like it'd be a good choice, you know.

Could be fun. Yeah. How do I, first in the Yes. Background, how do I base it on, like, strength and dexterity? Or Well, that's that's why I sent you that link to Archives of Memphis.

You can actually sort in there looking specifically for, specific ability specifically specific attributes. So you could say, I only want strength and dexterity ones. For a for a champion, your two best ability scores you you really don't need decks just just for the record. You do not need decks at all, because champions are gonna be running around in full plane most of the time. So decks is a not quite a dump stat, but it's not, like, something that you that I would encourage you to invest in.

Strength is always good. Con is always good. I don't think that there needs to be any use I don't think you have to have anything in in intelligence, wisdom, or charisma. But I'm not I'm not 100% on that. But Okay.

Ramsey, do you do you remember? Sorry. What was that? Oh, no. I I was I was talking about ability scores for champions.

I I think that, like, strength and con are pretty much the two ones that you wanna have. Dex isn't Dex isn't really necessary since you're gonna be running around in full plate. And I can't remember if there's any need for, any of the mental stats specifically. Not really. It depends what you're doing.

It wants pretty much strength, and then whatever skills you want may determine other things. Fair enough. Yeah. At least that's what I recall. Yeah.

Scott, how are you doing? I'm ready to fight. You done? I chose Dromar, and then I chose gladiator. Okay.

And then my class is barbarian, and I chose gosh. Which instinct did you go with? The animal instinct. Okay. And I chose a wolf, because I named my character after a famous barbarian, Wolfgar.

Oh, nice. I love rats. Okay. So, Scott, where you are right now then is picking languages. So you wanna click on edit for languages and you get, well, actually, don't pick languages just yet.

Sorry. I didn't do deity yet. Yeah. And you don't have to pick a deity specifically. The only person who really kinda has to pick a deity is the champion.

Everybody else doesn't really need to. But go go to your attribute modifiers and click edit on your attribute modifiers, And then pick out, you know, pick out what you wanna boost for that first. So strength. Yep. Hey.

And we're just a class. Constitution, probably. Constitution is not a bad one. Dex is also not bad for barbarian. Dexterity?

Is that what that stands for? Yes. Dexterity. Yep. Like your agility?

Mhmm. Or should I think of it like that? The god of Solaris is that or wherever we're at? It's Yeah. He is not in the d d section.

So you just have to type in you just have to type it in. So it's it's it's it's Raytheon, or Raythellian. So I cannot I cannot type it in there. You cannot type it in. You've restricted my access.

I can't type it in either. I just can't have to Oh, dear. Okay. I'll I'll I'll work on getting you, I'll I I may have to create a home brew DD in here to get him in there. But And what's the difference between intelligence?

Go ahead, Scott. What's the difference between intelligence to wisdom? Intelligence is book learning. Wisdom is street smarts. Yes.

That's the best way. Do that. Hey, Chris. My character is done. Okay.

I don't know what else to do with them. Well, next thing you need to do is you need to go over to the, the feats section. Oh, also, have you have you up up your have you boosted your attribute modifiers, Clark? No. I don't know how to do that.

Okay. So there's an edit button at the bottom where attribute modifiers are are. Yep. Click on that. Yep.

And then pick and then pick something, and then pick your boosts for your ancestry, your background, your class, if you if you have the ability to choose one. You're Oh, it says human two, and then relentless two, and then champion four. Oh, I have four total. Correct. So at level one so you get two boosts from being a human.

So you gotta choose two of those. So for you, it'd be strength and something else. Then we could just put them both in the strength? No. You can only put one in the strength, and then you have to pick something else for for your human one.

Alright. Then what? Then in your background, you should have you should you should have some options for things to pick. One of those will be strength, and the other one will be something else. K.

I mean, these I can chain I can add more boost later. Right? As you gain as you go higher in level, yes. Every every five levels, you get four boost that you can spend. So and then at the bottom here, you've got three level one.

You've got four boosts that you can Alright. You've got four boosts right there. Which language are we supposed to pick? You get to pick as many languages as you have, as your class plus your intelligence modifier sets. So some classes get access to more languages, some classes don't.

But Hey. If I'm going to be a paladin, do I need to have wisdom? No. Getting a lot of background voice. Yeah.

Does the paladin need wisdom at all or Prisma? No. Or maybe not. Just wait a second. I think it more depends what skills you want.

Alright. There's too much going on. What'd you say? It depends what skills you want. You want wisdom skills?

I would boost wisdom. I don't want I they agree with you. I don't know what a Paladin skills are. You get to pretty freakishoovers. Yeah.

So you you basically get access to the entire skill to all the skills on the list, but you're limited by your intelligence modifier and your class abilities. Intelligent modifier? Yes. You get a number of skills equal to whatever your class gives you plus your intelligence modifier. Like, rogues get like, I think six plus int or something like that.

They get an insane amount, but most people get around two plus inch. So Alright. One more time. So you get a number of, well, let me let me pull it up. Champion.

Champion. Okay. Skills. You are automatically trained in religion, and then you're trained in one skill determined by your choice of deity, and then you're trained in a number of additional skills skills equal to two plus your intelligence modifier. So those are your proficiencies.

So you have one more proficiency. Either wisdom, charisma, or dexterity, what would you recommend? Whatever like, honestly, there's honestly, there's not a bad choice. Like, if you it it like Ramsey said, it's just kinda what what you want your character to be better at. So if you want your character to be more book smart, go with intelligence.

If you want them to be more wise, go with wisdom. If you want them to be more likable, go with charisma. When you're done, what do you do? Well, when you're done with the attribute modifiers and the languages, is that the question, Scott? Do you just hit close?

No. You've gotta pick some fees on top of that as well. So if you go over to the, the thing that looks like a a runner's medal in the up in in the, what is it, upper upper right up upper right hand part of your character sheet. It's like catty corner from your level. What's it called?

It's called Feets. K. So inside there, you'll have, you'll have things to things to pick up. So, like, there you like, there are ancestry feeds that you'll you should have one ancestry feat available. If you aren't a spell caster, you should have a class feat available.

You might have a skill feat available just depending on what your class is. So you'll you'll be able to tell what's available and what's not because there will be a line that says empty slot, and then a, and then a magnifying glass. And you basically just kind of browse the same way that you did everything else. It'll open up, it'll open up the compendium browser, and that'll allow you to kind of, like, sift through your, sift through, your level one feeds. Yeah.

Jason, where are you? Bad. Looking at the background Mhmm. Suggestions. Suggestions for source for background.

Let me see. Great. Attributes. Charisma. So I guess what kind of, what kind of what kind of person do you envision this this character being?

Do you think that they're more of a naturalist? Do you think they're more of a religious person? Do you think they're more of a trickster? Do you think that they're, do you think that maybe they've got a, a connection with an extra planar being? Like, the I here, this one might be a good one for source where academy dropout.

It it boosts intelligence or charisma, gives you the arcade the arcana skill automatically in academia lore. It also gives you the dubious knowledge fee, which basically makes it so that whenever you roll whenever you roll, when you crit fail on a recall knowledge check, then I have to give you two pieces of information. One of those pieces of information is true and one of them is false. And you have to figure out which one is which. Say that again.

So that could be kinda cool. There's also the animal whisper one, which is more of a naturalist, does wisdom and charisma, boosts wisdom charisma, gives you nature lore, gives you the ability to train animals. There's an anti tech activist, so somebody who basically is more, like, does constitution and charisma, basically, gives you intimidation, guild lore, and gives you the group coercion skill feat. There's the classic charlatan, that, you know, that's classic sorcerer right there. Has boosts intelligence and charisma, has deception, underworld lore, charming liar.

You you know, your charm allows to win win over those those that win over those you lied to, when you get critical success in online action, the targets attitude towards you improves one additional step or one step. What was the first one you suggested? The academy dropout. Okay. That one could work really well for a sorcerer just because it's like, well, you had magic, so you thought that maybe you could go and learn it at a at a magic school, but, then quickly learned that they don't do magic the way you do magic.

And, you know, you ended up having to having to drop out. I'm liking it. Alright. Go. Go with that then.

80. Closest dragon. Right. Deity. They're like, all these deities here are, they're up for grabs.

I mean, they're Pathfinder deities. If you wanna if you wanna grab one of them, they can fit into, the home brew world. No problem. But don't feel like you have to pick up one if you don't want to. Great.

So and, Clark, your, your proficiency so everybody will need to, pick their proficiencies as well. So some of those are automatically do that. You go to where the hand is on on your character sheet. There's a hand in the upper thing. Click on that.

Got it. Those are where your proficiencies are. But, I think it gave me Annie. Yeah. I didn't I didn't put that.

Is that correct? Yeah. So some of your some of your proficiencies will all automatically be updated or will automatically become trained because of classes and or, classes and or backgrounds that you've chosen. So it will automatically get outdated. So, like, Clark, for you for example, you should have religion already trained because you're champion.

Champions we have to I don't know what that means. But okay. But I have an answering fee, task fee, skills fee, and a bonus fee. Okay. If you filled out all your fields So what do you do in their proficiencies?

So in proficiencies, let me go ahead and look look up what your, what barbarian gets. Athletics, performance. Barbarian. So you you will get some proficiencies automatically, but you also get to choose some. So for your for the barbarian, you are automatically trained in athletics, and you probably have another, you probably have another proficiency or two that are automatically that that are updated as well, based off your background.

Then on top of that, you get to choose three plus your intelligence modifier additional skills that you wanna be proficient in. And the way that you do that is you just click on the untrained box and you pick trained. Then I would get four. Clark, you get different ones because you're that's barbarian. Champion is different.

Let me get those ones for you. K. Champions get trained in what trained in religion automatically. You get trained in one skill determined by your choice of deity. So for Raefeleon, you would get trained in, you get trained in society.

I would? Yes. For your choice of deity, Raphaelian will be will give you training in society. Okay. And then you get an additional number of skills equal to two plus your intelligence modifier that you just get to choose.

So you can take two plus your intelligence modifier and just train yourself in any of the other, any of the other, I get three and it's in four skills. Correct? No. It's three three skills that you get to be that you get to add as marked and trained. Oh, okay.

Yeah. And I'll just go ahead and grab source where while I'm at it because I'm sure certain that Jason will want to know that as well. Yeah. Let me see. I'll get that figured out.

Okay. So proficiencies for source were Zero. No. Skills. Okay.

You are trained in one or more skills determined by your bloodline. So your bloodline should have made one of your skills already already trained. So you should already have some intimidation or genre. Yep. Alright.

And then you have a number of additional skills equal to two plus your intelligence modifier. So I see your intelligence. I have no intelligence. Do I edit my attributes? Do I how do we determine what those should be?

In the in the skill section? Or No. Like, character section. Character. Is there hey.

I'm done, Christopher. Okay. Good. Okay. So, Jason, you are in the character section.

So we're gonna have the entry modifiers. Yep. Okay. So you've got some stuff that you need to that you need to pick. Okay.

So you'll see the glowing circles, that have numbers inside them. Right? Like, next to human, there's a two. Next to academy dropout, there's a two. I don't see any of that.

In your attribute, please? In in my character. Okay. So see there. Where do I Okay.

So there's a orange box. I need to edit it. Edit next to attribute modifiers. Click on that. Okay.

I think there's quick question. Yeah. Are you limiting on the common rare stuff? No. Yep.

I still don't know where the echo's coming from. What signal's actually coming from you, Chris? I'm guessing it's Chris. Yeah. Because when I speak, your box also lights up.

It is. That seems to have fixed it, whatever you did. Okay. Cool. Yeah.

That sounds a lot better. Okay. I'm a little behind you guys, but I'll catch up. Don't you worry. No worries.

I'm stuck on allocating my attributes because, you know. So Jason, you have no intelligence, you said? You decided not to do intelligence? Well, I guess I need to plop some things in a few spots. So, I assume Yeah.

That and Razi does remind me, like, in this game, like, if you've got you don't necessarily need to build your character around other people not having ability scores and that kind of stuff. But I have found that if you have two characters that have very similar, very similar attribute things attribute things. And they both are trained in, and they're both trained in similar skills. The if one person has a has a better attribute than the other one, then it just kinda, like, more often than not, you're not using your skill that you've actually trained in. So, that doesn't have to be the case here, but, it is it is something that I've noticed in playing in playing myself.

Like, my character has a high strength, high int, and then we've got another character in there that has a high int. And a lot of my skills, I just don't use because the other character has a better has a better role. Has a has a better, attribute in it. And more often than not, they're all better than I am. So, at least in those areas.

So So the academy dropout, it looks like you're saying I have to take an intelligence and a charisma boost. It you do not. You have to take either an intelligence or a charisma boost, and then once you choose one of those, it'll open it up for you to be able to pick anything else. Oh. Yeah.

Alright. So wisdom here. I feel like intelligence is probably a good one to go with. But the character is gonna be like, Charisma is gonna be the power behind the magic. Is that true?

Yeah. Charisma is your charisma is your primary stat. So Right. Like all your magic is powered by charisma. So based on what I'm seeing here, I can drop I could drop three more points on charisma.

Mhmm. Pretty quick and easy. Yep. And then I won't be allowed to to drop on that, again. Right?

Like, my human, I've I've got the two points. I put one in charisma. I can't put it in charisma again. Correct? Correct.

Yeah. For each level, you can only put in charisma once. Right. So you still can, but going by that, you still can have a plus four charisma at the end of it by picking charisma at every level. Yeah.

Which is what I'm doing. Yep. Then after that for source where, it definitely doesn't hurt to have hit points and it definitely doesn't hurt to have dexterity. And, you know, obviously, you know, intelligence or wisdom, you know, that that could that could work out for you as well. So it's just kinda like how the rest of it is more just like how you want your character to kinda kinda be.

Right? Right. I feel like having a dragon background ought to give you a little bit of, you know, a little extra strength, but that's kind of a waste on the character. Maybe a constitution would be nice though. Yep.

I can see that. Scott, how are you doing? Hi. What else do I need to do? I'm I'm I'm trying to figure out where everybody's at so I can tell so I can tell.

So Clark let me see here. I did proficiencies. Okay. You haven't filled out languages yet, so you need to do that. So on your main on your main, on your main character screen, there's there's, an edit button next to languages.

Go ahead and go pick a couple languages. Hey. Kinda. Where where oh, on my front page? On your front page.

Yep. Oh, what languages should I have? Arcadian. Nice. Yeah.

That's useless. You can have, as far as, probably the like, if if you were a part of the blessed realm and you were, kind of like a a holy night there or something like that, then you probably would have some of the probably have some of the bigger languages like Elven or Dwarvish or something like that. The you if if you were more of a naturalist, then Sylvan is also a good one. That's the fairy language. In their, you know, in their number of other different things, it just kinda depends on again, just kinda depends on what you're, what you're wanting to do there.

Right? Well, I mean, I get that, but, you need a starting place and it should be whatever kind of is the most common. Yeah. So I would say I would say elven and dwarven would probably be your two most common ones. Because there's an elven nation that the blessed realm interacted with quite regularly and a dwarven nation as well.

Yep. Okay. That makes sense. So Alright. Alright.

What else? Okay. Let me see. Inventory. You need to we'll we'll cover we'll cover stuff there.

You don't have spell casting. Well, you do. You've got focus spells. Let's see. Ready to change my name.

Okay. Alright. Where do you change your name? Yeah. In if you just click on your if you just click on your name, you can just start typing.

Go highlight it, you can just start typing. Yeah. And all this stuff that I'm doing right now is stuff that you can look up in archives in Memphis, because that's exactly what I'm doing right now. So it's got your entire class stuff in there. Okay.

So champion ancestry background, initial proficiencies, champions code, followed code of conduct or tenants. I made it I made it to spell Cassie, but I don't know what it means. Okay. Well, Clark, I'm I'm I'm I'm sending you over tenants. Those are those are something that you'll that you'll need to figure out.

At least well, maybe don't figure them out for now. In in July, there's going to be an update in the champion coming, and there might be some changes that that we'll need to do. And I think that the champion's code actually falls under that. So don't worry about that. Don't worry about the tenants that I just sent you.

For now, we'll we'll take a look at it when the updates when the updates come. DD. Looking at the proficiencies, what do we we got a couple that are trained and then got a whole lot that are. Yeah. Is there anything here to do?

It doesn't I don't see anything blowing in. Yeah. So what you need to do is just click on the for the things that you want to update to trained, based off of your, you know, based off of your class that we talked about before, just click on the untrained box, and then it'll give you a drop down. And just pick the trained one for that. How many do I get to do that to?

Sorcerer was I wanna say three plus intelligence modifier, but two plus your intelligence modifier, that's how many you get. So I get to pick Mhmm. Two plus intelligence over above the ones that are already highlighted. Correct. Yeah.

Okay. Yep. Increase damage time. Okay. It's reaction.

Could you use special reaction, devotion spells. Here we go. Alright. What do I do about those spells? Okay.

So, Clark, in your in in your spell casting, just click on the add spell casting entry. Yep. Okay. Once you're in there, pick focus, and it's a spell casting type. Right?

It's one Where do I get examples or definitions of these proficiencies? I would check-in archives of Memphis, and that's, like, either of the, either of the links that I just have down there in the chat that aren't the first one, like the second or the third one. Those ones those ones will take you to archives of Memphis, and then you can just search for the specific skill that you're looking for. Or you could just, you know or or you could ask. I mean, I might not know the full answer, but I might be able to get in the direction.

Hey. Focus. Then what? Okay. Okay.

So okay. So you pick focus. You pick class d c as the proficiency. Right. You pick divine as the magic Oh, yeah.

Yep. Right. Magic tradition divine? Yep. And your key attribute or or your attribute for spell casting is charisma.

So is that set? I can't change it. Okay. What is it currently set to? Strength?

Okay. Well, then pick spell attack modifiers and DCs instead, and then pick charisma. Charisma? Yep. And then what?

Create it? And then create? Yep. K. So once you have that created, then you need to search for your spell.

So go to the, where it says divine focus spells at the top. Oh, yep. Click on the magnifying glass to open your browser. And And I can pick any one of those. You need to make sure that you have the trait of champion.

How do I So if you go into, on the left hand side, there's a traits box. Start typing in champion. That will give you the list of spells that you have access to. Oh, there we go. Okay.

Cool. And those spells are in and, you know, you only get first level spells, so it's just the first two. So you either have lay on hands or touch of corruption. Yeah. Let's do lay on hands.

Totally makes sense. Probably be a good one. I don't think that touch of corruption really fits in what you're trying to do. So Good job. No.

Okay. So when you Hey. I got a spell. Yeah. So you have that you have that spell as a focus spell.

And basically, what that means is you cast that spell and then you have to take ten minutes to refocus, and then you're able to cast the spell again. So you can cast that spell effectively every ten minutes assuming you do nothing else but refocus every every time. And lay on hands is actually pretty nice because it it heals 10 hit points. So you can basically just Oh. Boop boop boop boop boop.

You're at full. Yeah. That's really really good. Yeah. You're limited by time, but still Right.

Very good. As long as you're out, it's great out of combat and in combat, it can come in clutch. So And you get a one shot heal. Mhmm. Yep.

Alright. Am I done? I am looking. Okay. So you get a you get a champion feat as well at first level.

So if you go over your feat section so it's the it's the little bubble that looks like a, looks like a, looks like a running trophy or a running medal. That's your feet section. Those are those are it? Right. So what you need to do now, is anything that you have that is marked as an empty slot in there, you need to click on the, click on the magnifying glass next to it and find something that find something that you want to have as your as your feet.

So you might have an accessory one, you might have a class one, you might have a skill one. Come on. Alright. I go to champion or oh, that's campaign. That's not what you said.

Where's the champion feat? It would be under class feats. Oh, but I have a I already have one. Oh, okay. Well, I was then then you're good.

You're good there. Oh, okay. Perfect. Then I'm all good. Okay.

Do you have shield block on there? Nope. Shield block is on there. Okay. Let me think.

Anything else? Equipment. It's kind of important. So if you go over to inventory. Yes.

Starting money. I think it's 15 gold, but I'm checking. I would really like a really nice weapon. You can add 15 gold? Yep.

15 gold. So put 15 gold on your character sheet, and then and then start, start searching for equipment. Pick equipment like weapons and shields and armor or just in the equipment? Weapons, shields, armor, plus explorer packs or and rope or whatever else you wanna add. I would recommend picking up a backpack plus plus, a weapon, plus armor.

And Clark, specifically for you, I would recommend picking up a shield. A shield? Yeah. Unless you don't wanna sort unless you don't wanna sort and board it. Like, if you wanna if you wanna just use a big two handed weapon, you are welcome to do that as well.

But shields can negate a lot of damage in this game. So, and Scott, for you, obviously, pick up the biggest two hander you can find. That's that's you. Find find something that looks like it'll be it'll be big and nasty and you and you really like him and go with that. Oh, I see.

Scott, for you, likewise, there is an update to barbarian coming in in July. So, we might make we there might be some adjustments that we need to make make to it, but, I don't think it'll be too big of a difference. The rumor is that the barbarian is going to be able to rage for free though at the start of combat. Pretty sick. Yeah.

So Oh, like a reaction when combat starts or something like that? Yeah. As part of initiative as part of rolling initiative, you rage. Cool. So if you fall out of combat then you have to use, you know, you have to use an action to rage again.

But you can rage again in combat. And, yeah. And you get and you get as a free action, as part of rolling initiative. Rumor has, you know. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. We'll see what actually comes out. Oh, yeah. What was that spell called?

What did they relate that to? Oh, Scott, maybe you don't as as an animal instinct barbarian, it doesn't really look like you wanna be using the weapon. Oh, they're all claws and bites? Yeah. Yeah.

It's, the fear of the wild predator fills you with rage, granting you ferocious unarmed attacks. Cultures revered Veolia. Their challenges. Age spares give the barbarians with this instinct. Might also wear might also be at war with uncontrollable animalistic side of your personality.

You might be the descended werewolf or another were creature. Select an animal from the table, and you chose wolf. Right? So your unarmed attack does one d 10 piercing damage, plus it has the trip train. So you don't need a weapon.

Should I not be that way? It's up to you. Oh, that's awesome. It's really cool. Yeah.

I mean, it's it's definitely not it's definitely not a bad thing. It's just, you know, you know, it's not running around with a two handed weapon. You're just like, you know, more animalistic and and fighting with, you know, and fighting with your, you know, with your appendages instead. There are very few bad choices in this game. They have a little bit of a I don't know.

Almost all of them are some medals. So so really, Scott, it just depends on, like, if that fits with your fantasy of what your character what you want your character to do. If you don't want that to be what your character does, then probably pick a different instinct. If you are happy with that, then go to town. I forget how to change all that though.

That is actually pretty simple. All you need to do is go back and, delete your barbarian, and then go and pick a barbarian again, and it'll it'll let you pick a new instinct. So if you click on the see what's there? Oh, you got it. Yep.

I'm with me. Doesn't let me re pick everything. It doesn't? Just click barbarian, and it comes pre populated with what I already did. Okay.

So go back into the feet section. Scott, you've got a ton of, I think that you have too many, work feats. Yeah. Like, added a bunch of bonus feats. Yeah.

So those will Shouldn't have mess with it. Okay. So once you've deleted your class feats, go back to your, go back to your class and go back to the, main page, and then try and pick barbarian again. There's no class feats. There's only bonus feats?

Yeah. I would I would just go ahead and delete those two. I don't think that will work weapons. I don't I don't know which ones of those are barbarian, which one of those are your, ancestry feeds. So let's go ahead and delete them all.

We'll just pick it back up again. Okay. And then go back to your main page and pick the class. It's kinda already got that bear and everything in there. I don't know how to switch that.

Let's see here. My sword really matter? Well, right now, I don't have a favorite weapon of of Raythellian. So, like, since you are the since you are the first person to, be a be a, A polite. Champion of Raythellian, you can basically take your pick.

Now be the favorite weapon. I've decided I need more money. There's a way of getting Well, it's it's called going on adventures. No. You can just give me money to start with.

Okay. Scott, it looks like you're okay. Okay. Now that's letting me. Okay.

Good. You will need to update your attribute modifiers again and everything as well. Who are you talking to? Scott. Hey.

Oh. He's fixing his he's fixing his guy. He didn't wanna he didn't wanna be a a beast man. Ramsey, how are you doing? Doing alright.

Looking at equipment. I think I've got everything. Okay. Yeah. Sorry.

I left you alone. I just figured you knew what you were doing. So Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. No problem. Jason, how are you doing? I'm drowning. Don't drown.

Okay. What's the problem now? What's the problem? This is too many feet. Problem now.

Companies. So I'm I'm looking at ancestry feet. Okay. And I'm trying to figure out what the flip do I wanna do. Ah, okay.

So since you're a half elf, you have few more options available to you. Uh-huh. So let's see. You are Sameer? Supposedly, for now.

Okay. Ancestry things. Okay. So, yeah. So because you're because you are a half elf, you actually have access to the ancestry feats of humans, elves, and the half elf race.

So it's a little bit more than what most people have. Really what you're let's see here. See if I can do anything to kinda help with this. Adapted cantrip. What's that true?

Yeah. I looked at that one. I thought that might be a decent one. The ancestral longevity, I thought might be a fun one. I don't know if that that's important.

But, dragon spit sounds fun. Dragon spit does sound like fun. I don't even know what it does, but it sounds awesome. Elemental wrath was another fun one I thought might be fun. Elven weapon familiaration familiarity.

There you go. Familiarity. Chris, what kind of equipment did you say we should have? A a backpack? A backpack is a good thing because that has all of the essentials.

Is it called a backpack? It could be an adventurer's pack, explorer's pack. I forget exactly what it's called. Give me one second. I brought one's I don't see adventurous pack.

Let me see. I don't see backpack. Backpack. That's what it is. Backpack.

It's backpack. Why can't I see it under equipment? Because it's not equipment. It is A container? It's a container.

Yep. Well, that's dumb. I'm sorry that a backpack that holds things counts as a container, Clark. I'm real sorry about that. It's one silver piece, but what's the conversion between It's 10 silver to one bolt.

Perfect. Alright. What else do I need? If you can afford a healing potion or two, that's always a good idea. If you've got something that you consumable?

Yeah. It's a consumable. Let's see what it is. Mhmm. If you are if you have if you're skilled in in any in any crafting, like, arson tools or or, if you're skilled in disguise, you could use disguise kit.

Right. I don't know what I am. Yeah. You're not gonna be able to buy a full plate just yet, but, Jason. There are so many fun ones to choose from.

Yeah. That's well, I mean, honestly, honestly, man, you couldn't you you probably can't go wrong with any of the ones that you the any of the ones that you're interested in. So if you wanted to do, like, the elemental, the elemental raft one seems like that might be a a good one for you. Or the dragon Yeah. I thought that might be a fun one.

Yeah. Or dragon spit. So it looks to me like the dragon spit is, what I don't know is if is that just modifying how the spell works, or is that actually adding another spell to your repertoire? I believe that it's adding that cantrip. So And I don't know where it will drift.

One of the following cantrips, you can cast the spells in the arcane spell at will. And when you cast it, it's this spells energy emerges from your mouth. Yeah. It's just a cantrip that you get, but you, but it's it's a it's a cantrip that comes out like a breath weapon. So, you know, you don't get the you don't get the the template, but, you know, you just spit out the cantrip rather than, rather than doing any finagling.

So that's actually really nice because it's just like it's a cantrip thing. Well, so I guess do anything for. If you go into where am I? Into my feet and look at the bloodline. Cloud dragon?

Yes. Cloud dragon. So bloodline spells dragon breath. It looks to me like I would be doing I'm already doing that. Well Like, as a spell.

Right? So this is a this is a spell. Right? Not a cantrip. Yeah.

Correct. So this is a cantrip that you don't have to do any you don't have to do any verbal, somatic components for Oh, okay. Which in of itself is pretty awesome. And and that's when you basically just you have kinda all the time. Right?

Yeah. Exactly. It's an innate spell, so it's something that you can do 100% of the time. You don't have to prep it or anything. Yes, Scott.

I see your hand. I'm trying to figure out a weapon here. You said like, I'm looking at the great axe. Okay. And it's a two handed weapon.

Mhmm. And when it says damage and it rolls like a d 12 versus the bastard sword that rolls a d eight Yep. Is that better? Yes. It yes and no.

I mean, it's a better damage die for sure. And the great axe is definitely, is is definitely a good weapon to have. The bastard sword has versatility, which is something that the great axe doesn't. So the great the bastard sword, you can use one handed if you want or two handed. The great axe, you always have to use two handed.

So you're you know, you've got to have both of them. But a d 12 is nothing to snuff at either. Like, I mean, if if since you're since you're playing a barbarian, you're going for, like, going for broke, might as well go with the great apps and just smash the heck out of everything. So I know. How do I buy it?

Okay. So add that as a a cantrip. Nope. That's not here. But, yeah.

I mean, pretty much the main reason why I'm why I'm leaning more towards dragon spit is it's dragon spit. That seems pretty Right. I know. It's But it's pretty sounds pretty cool. But it certainly doesn't help that it is literally a cantrip that you can cast without needing to actually cast a spell.

A lot of spells in this game have the manipulate trait, which is basically like you have to do hand gestures or, you know, opponents to use them. And if you are right next to somebody who has a reaction, they can, when you're casting the spell, they can react to you casting the spell, which means if they've got a if they've got a reactive strike, they can hit you with a weapon or if they've got, you know, or if they've got some sort of counter spell, they can do that. I don't see dragon spit. I I think that dragon spit gets around that. I mean, I can be wrong.

I have been known to be wrong in the past. But, I it it basically says that you cast a spell as an innate arcane spell at will, and when you cast it, the spell's energy emerges from your mouth. So and I think I think innate arcane spells are are don't require somatic components. But, I guess that's something I need to look up. Okay.

So, Jason, have you chosen your Thanks. You you've chosen your ancestry feed. So we are I think we're good. Yep. Yeah.

So we are two spells with you. So you need to go where the little wand is. This is gonna be And there is the wand. Most time. Add spell casting entry.

Okay. Okay. Talk to me, brother. You're gonna be making two spell casting entries. The first one is going to be your, first one is going to be your regular spellcasting.

So your bloodline stuff. Or not your bloodline stuff. Your your regular spellcasting. So Known spells. Yeah.

So you need to Click on known spells. Add spell casting entry. Add spell casting entry. You're going to pick And spontaneous as the spell casting type because you are spontaneous caster. Oh, really?

Why am I spontaneous not innate? Because innate is a different is a different thing. The you're going to have an innate entry specifically for your dragon spit, but that's not, you know, your regular sorcerer stuff. Your regular sorcerer stuff is Gotcha. Your proficiency, you're going to use your class d c sorcerer for that.

Okay. And then your magic tradition is going to be arcane because you're a dragon sorcerer. Sorcerer. And then you got creating. Creating.

Okay. Okay. So now you've got this you've got this, arcane spontaneous spells section here. Mhmm. What you're gonna wanna do is you're gonna want to, go to where the first the first rank is, where those boxes are.

Okay. And you want to change those to threes because you have three first rank spells available to you. I enter a three in the oh, it didn't like that. Okay. Now cantrips.

First level, you have five cantrips. Believe that those are cantrips that you you don't have a spell book, so you just know you just know spells. So what you need to do is go to the in the cantrip section. You click on the you click on the open spell browser button. The little mouse click request.

And that's gonna give you all of the cantrips that you have access to. So you need to go through that and pick five of them. Okay. And then you're gonna wanna do the same thing with your, with your first rank spells. Mhmm.

But you only have two first rank spells that you have an access to. K. Well, let's not get me to, Okay. So focus on that. My pants here.

Yeah. So looking at at at cantrips, there's an electric arc. I think I'm already getting that with the dragon stuff, so I I should rule that one out. Yes. Yes.

Oh, I'm sorry. You have four cantrips. One of the cantrips is dictated to you by your bloodline. Alright. So let me go and find that one, and you can just add that.

Yeah. Please. So you're fantastic. So you have shield as your bloodline catcher. So that one is no choice.

You have to have that. Shield. I'm just gonna pull that out, and it's gonna automatically do nothing with it. I should pull it into your you just drag and drop it into your arcane spontaneous spell list, and it should go in there. There.

Oh, there it went. Now you got four more to pick. If you're looking for a good damage spell, specifically, they're, like, just what I found as an arcane caster, because I I'm playing an arcane caster in in in Ramsey's game. What I found as far as, like, good damage dealing cantrip, is telekinetic projectile is a good one. So if you're looking for good single target damage, telekinetic projectile is good.

Outside of that, Interesting. Yeah. Outside of that, electric arc is good for dual for hitting multiple people. And then there are just a bunch of really fun spells. So, I mean, there's like, you know, there might be some good utility spells in there that you can pick up as well.

You okay. Alright. Scott, Clark, you guys are good? No idea. I picked a gray x and some scale mail armor.

Sounds pretty good. Good or bad? No. That sounds great. And the back and the backpack as well?

A backpack? But I don't know how to pay for that because I don't know how many silver pieces. You can. 10 to one. If you if you click on the remove coins button, you can just say you can just pick, however however expensive it is for silver and then apply and it should automatically convert gold to silver.

Some of these spells, man. So I'm I'm just I'm just reading Timber here. It's our case Right. 50 foot long, basic reflex save. You create a small dead tree in your space that falls over on anyone in its path and immediately decomposes.

Any creature in the area does two d six bludgeoning damage with a basic reflex save throw. And the creature and if the creature critically fails, it's save. It's, it's knocked for a loop making it dazzled until the end of its turn. It's like, here's a tree. It just falls on track.

Right. It's that's just funny. Right? That's comedic. More than any it doesn't really do a lot of damage, I believe, but Yeah.

But dazzled is dazzled is in the back. But it's just you know, hilarious. Right? One of the things as a caster that you're gonna that you're gonna find is you're not necessarily going to be doing, like, tons of damage, but the more, but the more, the more status bonuses or or, you know, status bonuses you can give to people or, like, or conditions on your or adding conditions to your enemy is really gonna be, like, kinda helping everybody out. So the dazzled, just so you know, the eyes are over stimulated for your vision.

Your vision is swimming. If your vision is your only precise sense all creatures and objects are concealed from you. So like basically, you can't see anything, because you're just over stemmed. Yeah. I'm sure you've seen that with some of your students at one point or another.

Right. So for those of you who are who are, approaching being done with your characters, you are also, I I would like you to try and add in some character artwork. So looking for, looking for something online or or whatever that represents your character. If you click on your your main character sheet, if you click on that little, like, hooded eyed character person, it should open up a, an avatar, section. And you do have the ability to add to add pictures, to, to your character sheet here.

So you could basically go find a go find a character portrait that you like, put it in the avatar section, and then also you can, go over to the token section and, basically just add a layer or add your, you know, put your character avatar in there and you can also add a frame to it, that's unique to your own character. So if you're, if you're still trying to figure stuff out, then don't worry about it. But if you're if you think you're done, then that would be a good thing to good thing to work on then. You You said right click on the hooded thing? Or name?

No. Left click on it, and it should open up a dialogue where you can add a, add a picture. I need it in a minute. Don't move. I can right click, and it says, like, view character artwork and view token artwork.

Yeah. But you're if you left click on it, it doesn't do anything? Oh, talking the hood next to our name? Yes. Left click does nothing.

Okay. I thought I gave you guys access to that. Well, I guess in the meantime, good. If if you can find a character a piece of character art, then I can I can put it in there? But, I also want to give you guys the ability to update your character art if you want to.

I'll trust the players. Yeah. It matters. Create new tokens. Yeah.

You should be able to do it. I didn't use it on my test user. Okay. You're saying left click? Yeah.

Just your main click. It should open that dialogue. Maybe it's not. Not on the character sheet. It's over to the right under actors.

Hi. Where am I going? After you open up your character sheet, I did just move everybody into the party tab. So, from the actor section. So Alright.

View token. View character artwork? Yeah. I guess it's not giving you guys the ability to do that. So guess that's just on me.

I'll, but, yeah, if you can find a character if you can find some character art that that you think is a good representation of your character or if you wanna try and make an AI generated image to do that, then you are welcome to do that as well. Hey. There you go, Chris. Graham. Well, I mean, eventually.

What you wanna do? You're getting give me more money, it'll definitely be that way. Not bad. Or my other one is this one. That one should suffice.

Where are you, punk? Oh, yeah. Here we go. Just put one in there? Or this one.

Alright, Chris. Should I should I pull, like, a detect magic? Like, I think that's a useful one. Detect magic is always useful. Yeah.

I don't think no one else is gonna be running around with that. Right? I I have I'm untrained, but I can do it. You cannot detect magic, Clark. I don't think But I have arcana one.

Alright. I'm pulling detect magic. Do what? B u n. Alright.

That's that. Okay. Now I have spell rank. I need to check that one. Right?

First rank spells, you actually do have one you've got one that you have to take. Yay. Just like the, just like the other ones. So that one is and you can find this in your bloodline stuff. But, your first level spell that you have to take is Surestrike.

And then you get two other first level spells. Clark, where did you get those images? Can you just send me the link to them? They're coming in pretty, no. I got them on Googles.

They're coming in pretty bloody. What? Just a minute. Hours of interviewing. Okay.

Sounds good. Yeah. It's supposed to be thirty. Gotcha. Oh, I can't find the one.

You mean? We got another 15 later. Okay. Oh, there is me. I feel like that.

I believe. I mean, that might be something to talk about with him. Oh, it kind of worked. Did wasn't my list that I shouldn't have to pay extra for it? Yeah.

They're not gonna try this. Okay. Yeah. There we go. Who wants those?

Chris, I can't find them again. The only thing I Oh, where they're at. Is my link to work, Chris? Yep. Well, let me see what I can find.

Alright. Sorry, Chris. Allison needed me. No worries. I have to take a spell.

Which one did I have to take, Ken? Sure strike. Sure strike. There we go. Stick.

Okay. Ramsey, do you have a preference of which Oh, the first one, I think First. Was. Okay. Yeah.

That was the one I was looking at. And then when I yeah. When I checked the link, it just went to the all of them. Yeah. I wanna change my mind to this guy that I just posted, Chris.

Okay. Alright. So I need to pick out two more spells beyond that required one. Yep. Yeah.

None of them are good pitchers, Chris. So yours came through to me fine. Well, they're they're small. They're, like, a 120 pixels by Right. A 150 pixels, which means that they just come out real super blurry.

If that's what I've got to work with, that's what I got to work with. But, you know, would prefer to have a higher quality picture if possible. There we go. Oh, and Jason, just so you know, this it's been a while since I've started a campaign, but, everybody should know within the first three, four sessions, if you want to make any changes to your character that includes spells, races, classes, or a whole revision, you're welcome to do so. So don't feel like you're, don't feel like you're sticking yourself with stuff that you don't quite understand at this point.

You can give stuff a try. If you like it, you can, you can you can keep it. If you don't like it, then you can switch it out. So I don't want you to feel like you're Okay. Basically setting yourself up for failure if you choose the wrong spells here.

Failure is not the goal. Success is the goal. Yeah. There's just there's a lot of opportunities, here. Yes.

That is very true. Is that all we'll be doing for the evening? I gotta make another phone call tonight. Yeah. It it can be.

I was basically like, if we ended up having time to start playing, then I was gonna do that. But, I mean, at this point, we're about fifteen minutes out from from completion. So, I I did wanna let you guys know that I think that I might be available on the June 10 if that date still works for everybody. I know it's I know it's a I know it's a crapshoot, but if it does still work for people, then, that is definitely an option. I'm a be a little bit gent.

How are how are, people attacking? Are we all using weapons? Are we being, you know, bare bodied this? You know, what what do we call it? A weapon.

I got a weapon. He's got a weapon. Attack We have an another attacker. It's our offense on this team. Your offense Archie's got a weapon.

Your offense is the barbarian plus the champion. Not Thistlegrift. No. No. There's no offense here.

Barnes Is that do not Okay. Barnes do not offense. So Alwar is, is Ramsey? Yeah. Emerson?

That's me. Who's that? That's here. And you are you're attacking with a weapon. I have an ax.

Yeah. He has an ax. What's Karsten Kellamal Kendricks? Yeah. He's attacking.

Yep. He has a temple sword. Sword. Okay. Alright.

And then, what's Alwar doing? Spouse, mostly. I have bardic inspiration. Actually, we reverse that. Mostly bardic inspiration.

I can use my spells. Oh, okay. I can't. Yeah. Jason, what are you doing with your sorcerer?

Or what do you envision him as, I guess? Or you wanted to make him more like boom boom? A freak of nature? I don't know. I don't know.

So I chose the cloud dragon thing, and I was I'm trying to play with that a little bit. So Uh-huh. I think he's gonna be a lot of electricity. Yep. Though I don't have I don't have any of that, like, chosen as spells.

I think I'm assuming that comes in as part of his Konix stuff. So at the moment, I've got to detect magic. I had to have shield. And then there's the telekinetic projectile. So a little bit of offense there.

Uh-huh. The Surestrike is I had to take that one right, I believe. Yeah. Which probably not something that will be very useful for me, most of the time. But, well, it it You got it.

And then it could still be useful for you just because it's a one action cast. And if you have an attack spell that you're attacking with, sure strike still works. So Is it attack spell? Yeah. Yep.

Oh. Yeah. I don't know that. Otherwise, that'd be a really lead spell. Oh, right.

Well, that's why I was like, great. It makes me better at stabbing things. Awesome. I don't know if I'm gonna stab anything. But then I I'm choosing this runic weapon, because I think it could be helpful if I can cast it on, Sir, Emerson or Oh.

Carson to help boost their their attacking. Yeah. Sure. So, I guess I don't know. My my problem is always that I want to be a very broad character.

Mhmm. And I have a lot of proficiencies, but that doesn't bring a lot of depth Yeah. Most most of the time. So I'm I I struggle with that a little bit. Okay.

So, yeah, I don't I don't know. I don't know where to Okay. So what what is the, what is the struggle that you're trying to that you're trying to overcome? So what I don't wanna be, I don't wanna just, you know, like, come in and make everything, offensive spells. I don't I don't think that's necessarily gonna be an effective application of the character.

So I I'd like to like to have some other ways to affect combat. Yeah. I guess, I don't see a whole lot of like, everything I'm seeing that's, like, shielding stuff seems to be shielding me. Which is good because we don't want you to die. So Yeah.

But it doesn't help me when I'm shielding other like, I wanna be able to shield other people, so I'm having a hard time finding a way of doing that well. And there's a number of these spells that just seem like they're, like, showy. Just they I I don't see a practical application formula. Just using magic to use magic for fun. Okay.

Well, I I do have a suggestion for an offensive spell. I think it's a good idea to have at least one offensive spell for every rank that you have. Because that way, you always have something that you can do damage with. Right. So do the, like, the bloodline spells and stuff, are those automatically in here?

Or do I need to insert those? How does They will go in there automatically as well. Okay. So the bloodline spells are, those are specifically focus spells. So they're different Okay.

They're different category of spell. Alright. Now Don't need to worry about those with this. Yeah. So what I would what I would suggest, like I like, I'm I'm looking at what you currently have for your spell casting.

And you've got runic weapon and sure strike as a first level spell. Both of those are really good support spells. And Surestrike can be can aid you in offensive spells as well. There's one there's the the best damaging spell in first rank that you can get is shocking grasp. However, that requires that you be right next to the person when you're using it.

But it does Mhmm. Gangbusters as far as damages. So that's an option that's built. You could always go with fire breath, which is more which is more of a, a template spell. Right?

It's it's burning hands effectively. So that's that's another option as far as as far as, offensive spells are concerned. For Jason for for you and Ramsey, you can you can chime in anytime you want here too because you've you're familiar with the system and everything as well. But, like, I really think that if if if if it were me playing this character, I would wanna make sure that I had one offensive spell for every rank that I was in. First first rank, second rank, third rank, fourth rank.

And then after that, it's just like whatever you think will be most useful, you know? And definitely keeping an eye out for things that add status status penalties to bad guys. That is also very good. So that's kinda what what I would what I would do. Ramsey, do you do you have any suggestions to kinda help help Jason out here?

Yeah. No. I tend to agree. Like, broadcasters are never going to be, like, the best damage, but having the option to deal damage with any spell rank is pretty good. But yeah, no, I, I, I would agree.

Let's work. I'm trying to remember. I think source where it gets a decent number of slots. They wind up with four slots per rank. Yeah.

Eventually. Start with three and then go to four. Just put it good. Thunder strike. Under strike.

And, Owen, you also have one more cantrip that you have available to you. Yes. Two. For those? Right now, you just have to take magic shield and teleconnect projectile.

You should have five total. Holy cow. Oh, okay. That makes it more complicated. What what do we think?

Is thunder strike a good one, bad one? I think And with the electrical shock thing. Thunder strike? Let's see. Yeah.

No. A ACDC. There it is. There it is. One of them would work.

Whenever you do that spell, you have to play that song. One d 12 electric damage plus one d four sonic damage to the target. The problem is the reflex save, I think. I'm assuming that it's gonna be reasonable to save against. Well, it just depends on who you're going up against.

You're not gonna be running into like, if you're if if we're fighting monsters, reflex saves aren't necessarily going to be their strong suit. Depends. Some of them are more. But I I wouldn't I wouldn't steer clear of a reflex save. I mean, there might be some some battles in which it's gonna be really painful because you're going against somebody with a hydroxyzptor.

And that's the other, thing to keep in mind in spellcasting. Like, you want to eventually make sure right now, you're really limited. But eventually you wanna make sure that you can target different saves. So, you know, if something is does have a good reflex, you could hit him in the fort or hit him in the will save. Mhmm.

But unlike, say, D and D, I think Pathfinder does a better job of spreading the saves around. Like for example, in D and D, like, any monster's fortitude save is just going to be really good. It just is. Here, that's not necessarily the case. Like, every creature has essentially one good to save, one bad save, and one medium save.

They do a good job of mixing those around. But, yeah, reflex save's fine. Also, everyone says a basic reflex save, like this one here does. That means that even if they pass, they're still gonna take half of the damage. Oh.

Yeah. Gotcha. So the only way they completely avoid it is if they, critically succeed the save. Gotcha. Alright.

Thunder strike it is. No. Nice. And then I need to pick out two more Two more cans. Yeah.

Hand trips? Yep. K. Sorry, guys. I'm retargeting this process quite profoundly.

Well, you're playing a spellcaster, and this is the worst time They do. The character. So don't worry about it. When it comes to equipment, you're gonna be like super simple. Just be like, I have a backpack.

That's that's what I have. You know? Maybe some healing potions, but you don't really need a ton of equipment. Right. Clark had to skedaddle.

Also, Ramsey and Scott and and and Jason, I did put in a the character background questions that I that I wanted you guys to fill out. If if you do have a full background, I would love to see it, and I will totally use it. But at the bare minimum, I just wanted you to kind of give me give me some answers to some of those questions so that I could weave those into the story. For sure. For sure.

I guess there are 12 questions, not 10. I lied to you with sub bullets. Chris, can you give us the ability to see the other characters in the party? Yes. Yes.

I can. You should should already have it, but I'll make sure. K. Let's pull it up on a APM. Oh, I you've You've not seen much of anything?

You've got limited. I'll switch over to observer. That should fix it. How do you want us to reply to your questions, Chris? Either sending me, either sending me a message here at Gilded or, sending sending a text message reply, is fine as well, or send me an email.

Like, any of those any of those methods. I mean, I don't have all the answers right now, but Oh, I know. I don't expect you to have all those answers. Yeah. You know, the some of these questions are here just to get you kinda thinking about, like, how your character ticks and, you know, that kind of a thing so that we can like I said, so we can kind of weave that sort of stuff into the into the actual narrative.

I'm not planning on like, I've got an overarching theme, but this is gonna be very different from the way it was in Star Wars where I had a story and you guys were just following the story. Right? With this, it's gonna be a lot more of, building the story based off of not only your actions, but also based off of the, based off of your backgrounds, as well as this overarching story. So it'll be it'll be a little bit of, like, you know, big story, but we'll also have, like, little story stuff in there as well. And I'm not gonna be rushing you guys nearly as much as I was in Star Wars because if you guys don't do stuff, then you don't get XP.

So I don't have to worry about us having, like, five sessions where nobody does anything and you get 50 XP, you know? Which just makes things a little bit easier as far as, like, making sure that we're that that I'm not that I'm not building things too, too weak for you because, you know, you took a little bit longer to get there than I thought. So Mhmm. Would be a little bit more of a relaxed game, I'm hoping. Yep.

I'm gonna jet if that's kind of the end, and I'm available on the tenth, I think. So Okay. Cool. Yeah. Absolutely.

Thanks a lot, Scott. Thanks for You guys. Yeah. Have a good night. Yeah.

Thanks for coming with us. Hey, buddy. Check check you later. See you. It just, well, it didn't just occur to me, but I think it's really cool, Ramsey, that your gnome is your gnome's pog is smaller than everybody's because you're a small character.

That's fantastic. It just automatically made your pog your your token smaller. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. I love it. Oh, Chris. Yes. Do you have in your, your custom Pantheon, so just to make sure I kind of understand, it's almost sort of kind of like, Tolkien's take on it, where there's, like, the over god, and then there is the other deities are kind of lesser created things by him.

Is that kind of Yeah. Gist? Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

I know there's, like, tiers of them. I remember you saying there were, like, three main ones and then a bunch under there. Yeah. So Yeah. So there's the Yeah.

It it is very similar. I would say that there's a little bit of a nuance y thing with this that, like, the lesser gods are aspects of the greater god, but it's kind of Sure. It's kinda wonky. So Yeah. Yeah.

It's they've got their own personality. They're their own person, but they're but they're also like aspects of a representation of of the creator God. You know, it's just kind of like Sure. Like I said, little bit of wonkiness, but I don't even Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know how it works in my head, but I don't know how to explain it. So Sure.

So almost almost like the trinity except like a thousand of them. Yes. Yes. Almost like that. Mhmm.

Yep. Alright. Cool. Cool. Cool.

Do you, yet, have anything for, like, a, music style deity? I do not currently have anything for music style. Okay. But we can definitely work work something out. Cool.

Like, I I think that that would be kind of more of a what class would you be looking at here with that? Okay. So there it would be one of the one of the lesser ranked deities that would either, like so the rank of brilliance, which is the the second tier, is a deity that doesn't really impact the world very much. It's kind of like over an overarching an an overarching, aspect of nature. So, like, time would be one of the or, or an element like fire and that kind of broad broad strokes.

But underneath that, it would have, it it would have lesser deities that are more specific. Now, which is the rank of gilding luminescence, or guiding luminescence, I should say, not gilding. Cool. I think that a music based deity could is probably falling under the the third rank, the guiding luminescence. But the, the higher rank would be more of like a more of like an arts, like muse, you know, subtle thing.

And then if it's specific to, if it's specific to, like, general music, then that would be one of the aspects of of an in arts muse deity. So Okay. Makes sense. Yeah. Yeah.

But, yes, I do not have one. So you can feel free to make one and insert it. Correct. If you want to, or if you want me to work on it, I can do that too. But, you know, definitely definitely open.

Sick. Sounds good. I will put some font into it. Perfect. Still struggling with that fifth cantrip, Scott.

Or not Scott, Jason. Mhmm. Mhmm. Yeah. I was just looking around, and I think I've got what is this one?

This one? Yes. This one's just an attack roll. Frostbite is fortitude. Yeah.

On a basic fortitude save. Thunder strike is reflex. I don't have any I'm not seeing anything that's like will save per se. Yeah. I don't really know what to do with that last one.

I got new tech magic, frostbite, shield, telekinetic projectile. And I need one more. Falling tree one sounds kinda fun. Yeah. That one is that one is kinda cool.

There's also this like, I just opened it up, so I don't really know how good it is, but it's infectious enthusiasm. Yeah. With enchanted custom, you encourage yourself to get things done and share your motivation with your allies. You gain a plus one status bonus of your choice. Two attack roles will save charisma charisma based skill checks.

During the spell's duration, an ally who observe you casting the spell within 30 feet, when you did can take a single action and constant with which has the concentration trait and gain the same bonus. Using the spell to influence someone in a social situation, typically consider faux pas. I mean, that seems like it'd be kinda cool. It's like infectious enthusiasm is a it's a two it's a two prank spell, but let your last one round. So, I mean, it wouldn't necessarily do you a ton of favors when you're, doing it other than, like, giving you a bonus to Will saves or Christmas or Christmas skills.

It lasts for one round. Right? It lasts for one round. But the thing is, somebody else can It's tough. Spend an action and gain a plus one on their attack rule.

Yeah. It could be That's the could be useful. That is the bonus there. But the tree one is also awesome. Like, I thought that one This is funny.

I think I think it was funny and it's clever. Like, I think it I think it could work. So, I mean, if you're if you're leaning towards timber, I'd say do it. Grow a tree and knocks it and knock it over on somebody. Sounds fun.

Done. Done. Done. Alright. I think I guess my spell is out of the way.

Okay. Lord. So now that you've got that, we need to do your focus spells. So you want to add a spell casting entry again. This one will be a lot Okay.

A lot quicker. A lot less a lot less work. Focus. And in and when you do, you pick focus as the type. Use your use your class d c on it.

Okay. Still arcane? Still arcane. Yeah. Pretty big.

Your focus spell is going to be dragon claws because that's your initial bloodline spell, and that's what your focus spell spells. So I I have to hit the edit button? Search. Search button. Searching.

Searching. Right. The open spell browser. Little magnifying glass. Dragon claw.

Done. Boom. That was easy. Yeah. Alright.

Connect skin is better. So then do I gotta do some other ones to get those other spells that are? You just have to align based. So, like, when as you level, your bloodline spells will advance. And so you'll go from dragon claws to dragon breath Oh, okay.

To dragon eggs. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. So that'll just happen as part of your leveling process.

Okay. Looks like you've got your skill feet. Looks like you've got well, you've got a skill feet. That's from your that's from your background. You got your ancestry feet.

Oh, Jason, one other thing when it comes to ancestry feet. A good it's not it's not a and and I need to I need to help Clark about this as well, and probably and probably Scott as well. But one of the ancestry feats that you get is a that you can get as a human is called, is it assurance or versatile or something? But it basically makes it so that you can choose a skill and just take 10 on that skill. So if you roll underneath it if you roll underneath the 10, it just makes it a 10.

So, that's a that's a nice one to keep an eye out for. Is is like I said, it's not like fancy. It's not like, oh, it's new. I I've got this really cool ability, but it really does kinda help help make sure that you that you hit that you hit your, that you hit the things that you need to hit when it comes to when it comes to skills. It's not like attacks, but, like, you know, skill skill things that you that you Gotcha.

Okay. So outside of that, I think you're good. So is my, we just need to get your inventory. So you start off with the gold. Ancestry feat is good.

That's the dragon spit. Yep. Skill feat, the, I'm assuming I chose dubious knowledge. I don't think. That came from your background.

That's why there's a BG. Okay. I was gonna say, I don't think I picked Helen. I don't know where that came from. Okay.

So I don't need any class feats. Right? Not at the moment. You will get your first class knight on at level two, because you are a spellcaster. Your first plat your level one class fee is being able to cast spell.

So You're right. Okay. Alright. So we're good there. Proficiency is I think we're good with proficiency is.

I don't have any effects besides scaring people. Crafting Yeah. You know? Did choose that as a as a proficiency. Yeah.

It looks like you have crafting trained. Yes. Right now, so crafting will allow you to repair things as well as build as well as build item. There are skill fields that you can get that will, allow you to build build magic items and that kind of thing as well. Mhmm.

And That's the goal. Yeah. And you can do that and it's it's it's not a, it's not terrible. It it it it it will not necessarily, be a lot cheaper, but it can be a lot cheaper for you to be building things. And you have to have and you have to have recipes for them.

So, you know, that's just something to something to keep in mind. But if that's one of your goals, then I can definitely make sure that I drop some recipes and things in there to kinda help help get you get you off the ground as far as, like, crafting is concerned. You can craft a bunch of different things. You can do Yeah. Magical items.

I was I was thinking of it in terms of, maybe, like, from a, a background. Yeah. Like, he was a smith of some sort or Okay. That was part of his source of income. That was that was part of how he so that's kind of my thinking there.

Sure. Yeah. With that. No. That works.

Not try not as a way to try and get around purchasing Oh, no. No. No. And items or or whatever, but but more of a, hey, you know, like, this is something the guy has done and is interested, you know, enjoys doing maybe maybe high level or something just, but it's, also as a way of generating income. Yeah.

And and like I said, I mean, I'm not concerned about it. Like, you we we can make sure that we get you recipes and different things if that's if that's something you wanna pursue. You can do magical items. You can also do magic tattoos. You can do alchemy.

Like, crafting pretty much covers the majority of different things. You just have to have Yeah. Craft skill feats in order to be able to do it. So Right. Definitely a thing that Sad.

Keeps on Sad thing. Because then that means that all these, you know, opportunity costs are taking Oh, the crafting. Effects. Yeah. The crafting rules in the in the non remastered pathfinder were really lame.

I think crafting has gotten a lot better in in in the remaster. So, it's the it actually makes it a little bit more viable. So, should be good for that. Outside of that, we just have the inventory, that you need to do. So, Oh, here.

The inventory. You add coins, add 15 gold. I can add 15 gold. Yep. Maybe.

I don't know how to add gold, I guess. There is a plus button next to the, in the upper right hand corner in the coin section. Gotcha. 15 gold. Done.

15 gold. Alright. Any silver or platinum or copper? No. Just gold.

Okay. Alright. Sounds great. Alright. So To Yeah.

So for Oh, you put that in my treasure. Is that where it's supposed to be? Yep. Just so. Okay.

So for you, you don't have let's let me take a look at your proficiencies here. Yeah, proficiencies, baby. I took acrobats. Okay, so you have simple weapons and unarmed attacks, and unarmed Yes. I do have those.

So as far as your proficiencies are concerned, I mean, you could pick up a staff, or other simple weapon if you wanted to have something to hit people over the head with, if you didn't wanna just magic them all the time. But you So here, is there a way to, I am, offensive fields. I click on that button. Is there a way to say, hey. Like, So So if you click on the Weapons, filters Yeah.

And pull weapons. Yep. Okay. Yeah. It's in the chair repeater.

Or what? Oh, weights? No. Weapon filters. Yeah.

There you go. So you can basically just pick up one of those. So, if you want to purchase it and not, then click on the, coins next to whatever it reaches. It will just automatically deduct it from your, from your treasure pouch. Oh, tent lock musket.

That's a simple weapon? Well, it is a simple weapon, but Is it did I like, did I not click a right button? Is what happened? No. You you could have a flintlock musket if you wanted to, and it is a simple weapon.

But muskets are a pain in the butt unless you are unless you respect for them. You know, shoot basically, you have to, what's the what's the thing? You have to they've got a reload action that you have to use for them. Right. So you shoot then reload, which basically at that point is cutting into your spell casting.

Guns in this game Holy water. Guns in this game were actually kinda neat because they don't do, like, they do average damage. They don't do a great they don't do great as far as damage is concerned. But they have the fatal trait, which basically means when you crit, you do impact you know, you do, like, for the flip mop musket that you have right that that I've got right here. It does, what's the damage on this thing?

Musket. It does It does one d six piercing damage, but it's got fatal d 10, which means if you crit, you do not only double damage. So you do two d six or, you know, one d six times two, but you also add another d 10 to it. So guns get really deadly when they crit. Other than that, they're just kinda like regular regular weapon.

They're they're less good bows is what they are. They're like bad bows, but if you crit, oh, man, they they do great. There is a simple long sword. I mean, that's all I need. A long sword is a martial weapon.

How is that not a simple weapon also? It just it just is. It requires a little bit more skill to swing A long sword. Short sword? Short sword.

Alright. I think I'm gonna hop off, guys. I think I'm almost done. Pretty sure. But, yeah.

I just realized I was in a way in as as I sit here. So Yeah. I think Jason is So we got out of here. As far as weapons are concerned, you're restricted to bladed weapons. You're restricted to plan you're you're restricted to daggers.

Daggers and You could do clubs. Legending. You could do a frying pan, sickles, spear. I mean, you could just go with the classic staff. I mean, it's a it's a classic for a spellcaster for a reason.

Bong somebody on the head. What about the icicle? The icicle? Yeah. Hassle nuts.

Considering that it's a thousand gold pieces. Oh. And a level 16 item. It's probably Level 16 item? Yeah.

Why didn't somebody say there was a way too price. Yes. Let's let's drop that gold price down to, what, 15? 15 is your max. Yeah.

I mean, I agree. The icicle would be amazing for a level one player. Well, my other chick had the crossbow, and that seemed to work pretty good for her. Yeah. Where is this staff you speak of?

This doesn't can deliver a mighty blow. I I'm unsure that that's a really One piece of wood can make you walking and delivering. That mighty glow is one d four blushing and damage. Mhmm. Mighty glow.

But I mean, it give you something to something to do if somebody's all up in your grill. Mhmm. Interesting. Why are a bunch of these, unique items at no cost? Could you can only get them one way?

You can't I'm assuming. Yeah. The unique items are gonna be a little bit more of a, little bit harder to get. But, I mean, if you've got a if you've got an argument for a unique item that you wanna that you wanna pick up, then you're more than welcome to do so. Alright.

Well, I got the difference between a crossbow and a hand crossbow. Crossbow is a two handed weapon, and a hand crossbow is a one hander. Oh. It's the difference between Scott's crossbow and a pistol crossbow. Or does it say like, how do you know what I don't see where it says, like, damage modifiers or what you you know, like, any of that stuff.

Is it based on dexterity? Is it based on strength? That sort of stuff. If the weapon is if the weapon is has the finesse trait, then it uses dexterity. If it does not have the finesse trait, then it uses strength.

How do you see where it says that? Let me see. So at the top of the, if you open up the if you click on the, on the magic guide or on the item, it opens up a dialogue for it. Mhmm. And if and right underneath the name of the item, there's a list of of traits that are associated with it.

So, like, with your staff weapon summary? Yeah. Alright. Give me a second here. Pulling the staff up.

Staff is So your staff has the trait and the two hand d eight trait, but not the finesse trait. Oh. So your staff, if you're swinging around with one hand, does a d six, but it's versatile. So if you use two hands, then it does d eight instead. Interesting.

Okay. Well interesting. Oh, we'll just take a dagger of on through. Yeah. Why not?

So then I, put the coins on the side? Yep. You know, automatically Buy item. Right. Did it do it?

It's not doing it. Is it because I have no silver? Does it say you don't have enough silver to No. It doesn't say it. It doesn't say anything.

It says buy item, but buy it. Well, you can always pull it over and, and then just remove the coins manually as well. How do I how do I do that? So next to the plus side, just hit the minus side to remove coins. Right.

And put in the number of silver and hit remove coins. That should remove it. And it should do the, do the math for you. Remove value. Remove coins.

Okay. I removed two silver coins, theoretically. Nothing happened. It hates me. Alright.

Insufficient coins. Oh, there it popped. It just doesn't like that. Oh, how many silver coins is a is a gold coin worth? 10.

Here, let me try something. I'm gonna Try something. Okay. I don't know what you did, but it did it. The way that you do it is you click on the remove coins, and there's a checkbox that says remove value, not specific type.

Click on the checkbox. So it it was upset because I didn't click the box. Yeah. Alright. So there's, a couple of weapons.

Beautiful. Armor. Okay. The other things that you're gonna wanna do is you're definitely wanna get a wanna get a backpack. I do not want steel armor.

This doesn't go well with Elephants. Yeah. Probably. Probably. So where do I find this?

Is this gonna be in the container section? You find a backpack there? Yep. K. I have a backpack.

I'm gonna buy the item, but it's not gonna let me. Okay. So I'm gonna grab the backpack, put it in my container, and then I'm gonna go over here to subtract one gold piece. Or silver. Sorry.

Alright. Okay. That's that. Now your backpack holds four bulk of items, so you can basically just kinda pack it with a bunch of with a bunch of stuff. The rest of it is basically looking at consumables and equipment.

Equipment might be like crafting supplies or different things like that. If you wanted to look up, like, a blacksmith's, blacksmith's, supply kit or a tinker's kit or something like that. There doesn't appear to be versatile tinderbox. There's a cantrip deck. I don't know what that'd be about, but she is a Lexer.

Don't know what that about. Let's see. Trait. So is there, like, some healing potions in here? There are.

The healing potions are consumables. Yeah. So I don't wanna switch over to that. I'm looking at that. Potion of acid, cold, electricity, emergency escape, fire, shared memories.

It's not it's not healing potion. You can healing potion minor. Yeah. You can go into the traits area and and just type in healing, and that'll pull up, a bunch of the healing healing things in there. It's four gold, It is.

Bowser. Not buying a ton of those, are you? No. Not not at this point. I mean, you'll obviously, as you adventure, you'll get more gold, which means you can buy more stuff.

So it's kinda for you, all the stuff that you wanna buy are kind of more, are more expensive at the moment. It's kind of like where where the martial characters were spending all their time trying to pick up equipment. You were spending all your time picking up spells. So, Right. Alright.

So I got a healing potion. Looks like that's good. Yep. Seems good. I don't know.

Maybe someday I'll craft that. Maybe not. Well, you can if you get if you get the, alky the alchemical crafting feat, you will be able to craft healing potions. Oh, yeah. Alright.

Equipment. And for that stuff, it's just more along the lines of whatever you feel is let me see if there's an adventurers. Yeah. I just I don't even know what I would be looking for that would be. Yeah.

That's kind of the trick here. I mean, I saw like a grappling hook at one point, but that could be cool. Grappling hook is good. Bad roll would probably be good. Where's a bad roll?

Rations Bad roll. Would be good. Consumables, equipment, equipment. Rations are in here. Yeah.

I think they're in the consumable. Oh. Okay. So The portrait. Federal.

Which was the federal? Two copper. Yeah. Rations are in are in consumables. How long do rations last?

Oh, okay. I don't I guess I don't see an actual regular grappling hook. See grappling arrow and grappling bolt. I think that that's in the equipment section. Yeah.

Yeah. Grappling up one silver piece. Okay. I'll just drop it in there, Sally. Here you go.

Did you do it? Yep. One grappling cup. Did you pay for it? Yep.

Sweet. Thanks. I don't know. Yeah. No problem.

Does the grappling hook come with rope? It does not, but the adventurous pack does. The adventurous pack is a kit, 15 silver pieces. That's not in equipment? It's not in equipment.

It is in kit. Oh, okay. Kit. Adventurers pack. I think the adventurer's pack just has, like, just a bunch of the different stuff.

Yeah. It's got, it looks like it's got, fashions already. Yeah. It's got the robe bedroll already. The backpack.

So it'd be a lot better to just buy that and all those other items. Yeah. I was looking for it earlier. I just couldn't figure out where it was until Yeah. Alright.

So right. I'm just gonna delete the backpack. I can do it. I should probably get rid of a couple of rations. Oh, I don't know.

I'll keep them. I'll keep the rations. There you go. That's that looks more familiar. I was thinking, why doesn't the backpack have anything in it?

Okay. So I think I got it brought in. Looks like it. Yep. Yeah.

I put the rations and the healing potion from the consumables into the backpack. Yep. Can drop in or drag and drop those? Yeah. You should be able to.

Oh, it's got a torch as well. Alright. So did I think that at this point, you're probably good. You know? Did the did the backpack get refunded?

It did not. Okay. How much was it? That's a great question. One silver piece.

There's one? Yeah. Okay. So I'll just I'll add one silver piece, one real quick. Perfect.

I'm gonna get rid of the bed roll, and I think it says this was two copper pieces. Okay. So copper will be two. So I have a grappling hook that will go into the backpack with the rope. I have a minor healing potion, rope, water, skin, cock, for whatever reason.

Flint, I should have three rations. I see two. What happened? Looks like you've got four total. Yeah.

Does it look like I've got four? Yeah. So you've got two ration entries, but if you look over to the quantity, one of those is three. The other one Three. Yeah.

Somehow they combine themselves. Oh, okay. Yeah. Works for me. They even give me soap.

That's nice. Soap is always No way I can nice to have. That way I can stink less. Alright. That's probably good, like you said.

Yeah. Anything else I can do to make this dude awesome?
