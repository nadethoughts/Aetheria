So it is the early spring. A year has passed since the flaming war tribulation. You guys have, been in a year of building and trying to find your way in the world. In some ways, this world seems very familiar as you have as you've grown up, but grown up in it. But, also, there are so many things that you don't know and so many alien situations that you found yourself in.

It has gone from a very tame world to to more of a wild world. And you have been using the past year to reconcile the world that you knew and the world that you now. Kahir, you've been, you are you've been able to establish establish yourself as a as a fairly, solid blacksmith in the in the area. You have, been able to build weapons and armaments as well as, as well as traps and and different things, to help the community survive. And you are at your you are at your forge, which is near the center or which is near the market.

Karsten, Karsten and Samir, you are on patrol right now. You've been you've been requisitioned by, the order, Karsten, to nap to walk around the the the community, on patrol looking for things that need to be things that need to be addressed and or looking for, insurgence of things that might need to be, well, taking care of it in in a more martial way. Samira, you are not necessarily part of the the city guard, but you have been, but you've been, you know, you've you've been tagging along with Carson every now and then. Not on a specific, like, watch duty or anything, but, you know, you've you basically have gotten to the point where you're more, where, you know, occasionally, if if Carson asks you to do it, you'll you'll go on a you'll go on a walk police on patrol. That's right, buddy.

So you two are, going that are going that route. Our as as the as the community dad and and, and, person of, person of joy in the Yeah. In the, community. You are in the, you're you're in the marketplace yourself, probably doing some sort of doing some sort of, performance of some kind, whether it's music or telling stories or or whatever it is that you do. Mhmm.

You you're basically, you know, providing some flavor and some color to to the marketplace while it's open. Kahir, you you as you're as you're working on the iron, just hammering hammering out, a a flat, hammering out something on on the, on the for or in the forge, you feel a rumble in the ground, which takes which takes your attention, especially with the, with the destruction of the of the, of the flaming retribution. The, the the earthquakes, the fire, the brimstone, it all comes rushing back to you as you feel what is unmistakably an earthquake. You move you you move out of the, out of the smithy and move towards, run towards the sound as this at the same time as Karsten and Samir get get word of this and start running in that general area as well. Our the crowd that has surrounded you, you you basically you you shoo them off as as, you know, something something, strange is happening.

You're trying to trying to get them to get out of the to get out of the area. You all converge in in the spot that Auer was at with a makeshift stage that he was on. And all of a sudden, as you as the four of you converge in this, really, it's more of a 30 foot, 30 foot area, the ground itself erupts with an explosion, and you fall through a hole. Oh, you are, you grab at different rocks and different things to try and to try and stay your fault, but you are but you are unsuccessful in being able to, in being able to escape it. However, with all of the with all the ways that you've grabbed at you know, with all the ledges and things that you grabbed at, you were able to break your fall enough that none of you take any damage from from the from the fall.

And you land on a, on a smooth stone surface, surrounding you. You look around, taking everything in very quickly. You find yourself on a bridge with a with a lake of sand underneath it, to, at the end of the bridge, you see a temple. You see a temple, that looks like it wasn't necessarily meant to be an underground temple, but it's sitting in this cavern. Amongst the rubble, you see corpses and and broken bones and a number of goblins that are smoldering and, they are smoldering and and, you know, unconscious.

You look behind. You see a, you you see what looks to be a cave in, at the other end of the bridge. And then as you as you get up, you're just kinda trying to figure out what's happened. A few of the it's good that you got that out early. A few of the Alright.

It's going on. First roll of the game. Alright. I'm just trying to figure out how to make it roll, and, of course, what do I roll? Hey.

Anyway. Yes. Sorry. Sorry. And as you're as you're taking in the surroundings, a a few of these smoldering, goblin, corpses or what look what you took as corpses get up, shake their heads off, look at you, and say, how many long shakes are there?

Pull out their weapons and move towards you. At that exact moment, those of you that are in front, so, those of you that are in front, you see that there are, that some of the that a pile of bones that you took for just a pile of bones assembles itself into a skeleton, pulls out a scimitar, and starts moving towards you. And in the distance, you you see a, what looks to be a corpse starting to shim. Everybody roll initiatives. Can we do that again?

Is it in our character sheet? If you well, actually, I guess that's I guess that's for me. So okay, so I'm gonna move you into the battle map. Bow. Get that started.

In the Sam Hill. Yeah. I think I'm pretty much stunned. Like, what the frick just happened? I don't see my guy.

Oh, there he is. He's up top. Oh, suck it. Very nice. Where are you rolling for sub Up top on their guy.

It has a little dye on it. Nice. Nice. Good job. Oh, crap.

Oh, I can't see anyone. I'm blind. Undo. Everybody went away. It's all better.

I'm sorry. I, I accidentally deleted everybody. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-huh.

Uh-huh. There you go. Here. Undead 51. I'm sorry.

I am so on my character sheet, I go to perception. Is that what I'm doing? Yeah. It was all along the top, but then it went away. Yeah.

No. I put I put it back up. Clark, you are 21. Right? That was what you had?

That is correct. I'll just make sure that you're 20 one. I got an 8. I don't know how that happened because I did not roll it. No.

I I I got an eight. I deleted you guys. It removed everyone from the from the combat channel, so I'm trying to trying to fix it. Mhmm. Gotcha.

Alright. Okay. Does anybody else remember what they rolled? It's on the thing. I had a 12.

Ramsey had a 25. Yep. It's in the chat still. Oh, nice. Damn.

I'd like to reroll. Possible? Oh, yeah. You do have a hero point. That is possible.

Well, there you there we go. I'm last? No. You're not. No.

I I should be last. What what did Samir rule? The cumulative eight, not a one. Eight? Yeah.

Improved my, previous roll by rolling a four. You need to get better at roll. He said I really like character. His pictures of the characters are pretty wicked. Yeah.

Every yeah. Everybody's character come out pretty cool. Yeah. Even Ramsay's old man. He looks like Santa Claus.

Oh, it looks like Santa Claus. Alright. Big ears. Alright. So That's hilarious.

Here we go. And just, so the goblins that are behind you, like that Hey. They're wearing cups in front. They're What is that? They're junk.

The head is a goblin? Looks like a gremlin. Yeah. No. That's those are those are Pathfinder goblins.

Gizmo Gizmo had a bad day. Yeah. Bones that you that turned into a skeleton look like that. Wow. And That is a giant temple.

Holy crap. Yes. Corpse. Wow. It's Woah.

Shambling towards you looking like that. Alright. Okay. It's not like right? I'm sorry, Alwar.

That might give you a bad day. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

So No. I don't see any guys have so you guys have dropped from a great distance. You just you're taking everything in, and all of a sudden, these all of a sudden, you find yourself under attack. Alwar, what do you do? Well, question.

What is the light condition down here like? It is there there are no there are no lights in here, but there's enough light coming from the coming from the whole The bing, the whole to give you the ability to see around. Okay. Alright. Cool.

Cool. Cool. Excellent. Elwar kind of gets up, brushes himself off a little bit. Like, oh, that was a nasty what the hell is that?

Yeah. What do I do? Well, yeah. I think that is going to be about the best thing that I can do. That seems fine.

We're first of all going to, do a little bit of, tactical repositioning. He's gonna he's gonna take an action to move. But as he does so, he's kind of gonna look around, at the his three companions. I'm assuming too that even though we may not necessarily be, like, super tight, friends, we probably do know each other at least. You absolutely do.

You know you know each other you know each other by sight and by name, at the very least Except for Jason and I. Right? Well, at the very least. Like, you and Jason have have a relationship. Other people could have relationships if if you wanted, but at the very least, you know from each other.

Okay. I mean, I'm good knowing everyone. I imagine I just think you're a little strange. That sounds about right. Alright.

So I'm gonna move. And as I do, so I'm gonna look at everybody, and in turn, you know, kind of call them by name. Karsten, Sameer, Jahir. Is everyone alright? And, I'm going to pass shield.

That seems appropriate. Probably a good idea. So we're gonna do that. And when you cast it, you will need to drag the spell effect shield onto your, token for it to take effect from the. How do you do this?

I just push the spell effect shield. I see. Yes. Yeah. You just.

I also want to see crystal. I like the background map. Okay. Cool. Interesting.

Did that. Alright. Excellent. And then, I'm going to, say something effect of, well, I know some of you guys are evil fighters. Hope.

And No. No way. And I'm gonna sing a, few bars of a, inspirational heroic, folk tale. Beneath the moon, soft silver light where shadows dance and dreams take flight. But Cheryl's heart begins to rise to seek the stop in disguise.

And I cast courageous anthem. That's what it's called here. Bam a lamb, and that goes to everybody. And I think can I drag onto them? I think so.

Or if you I lack permission. Okay. Everybody else can, though. So if you go over to the chat window, you look at the chat window, there's this courageous anthem in there. Yep.

There's a box that says spell effect courageous anthem. You just click and drag that onto your token, and it will add it to your token. Yep. And it is going to automatically make those adjustments to all of those things? Yes.

Should. Wow. If Sweet. So, you know, yeah. Plus one to attack and damage rolls and the saves against a weird.

But plus one to attack and damage is the big one. I'm also going to use my focus point. I do not have enough Focus Points. I surely do because I haven't used any, and I have two. Oh, hey.

Oh, hey. I get to place the for that. I see how that works. Boom. Alright.

Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.

Cool. Is this is that how it's going to work? Interesting. There we go. Okay.

So I use, lingering compositions. I need to make a, performance check when I do so, and if I succeed, it will last for three rounds instead of just one. Nice. And the DC is by full. So I'm not sure offhand what that is, but I'm pretty certain that that will do it.

Good lord. Wow. We're rolling really good. You're rolling. Oh, that is You guys are rolling really well.

That's all three of my actions. So I was hoping to be able to go into my, spell casting, section here on my character sheet and, you know, click on a spell and kind of see a description and blah blah blah blah, and I'm not finding that there. Where do I go to find this? I went from mine. I I went to my character sheet, and then I went to my spells, spell casting.

And then I clicked on the title, And then it does a drop down, and it tells you everything you wanna know. K. So what is wrong with my okay. I'm gonna try something. Yep.

That's what the problem is. Beautiful. Alright. And just so you guys know I'm I'm not just saying that I'm doing nothing. I'm updating your courageous anthem so it lasts four rounds instead of three instead of Oh, excellent.

You're you're good, Chris. I thought you weren't doing nothing. Yeah. I figured Okay. I'm just kidding.

I figured he thought I was doing nothing, so that's why I said it. It's like, Clark, he just doesn't believe I'm doing it. Alright. Alright. Cool.

Cool. Cool. Alright. Karsten, you were up. Hey.

So Now when we called Domino well, since you're on guard duty, you were probably walking around with your weapon. Yes. So you don't have to use an action to draw your weapon. I do have to use an action to move. Right?

You do have to use an action to move. Alright. So when we fall down and I get up, I was like, what the? And then the silly gnome starts singing and talking and moving. And I'm like, man, all the times the wannabe elf starts singing when he should be fighting.

Oh, hope And I chuckle, so it's more of a jovial teasing. Yeah. Yeah. And then I and then I move, and then I'm gonna whack this guy. Alright.

Awesome. So you will need to target, the skeleton. Oh, shoot. I'm not targeting crap. I think you just need to double click on it.

I am double clicking on it. Nothing happens. What about right clicking on it? Nothing happens. Oh, there we go.

I got it. I got it. Click. Right. Alright.

There we go. Double right click. Now go to my character sheet, and what do I do? Okay. So you're in your character sheet.

Go to the actions tab, which is the second one over. Yep. You have There we go. Yep. So your first attack is the strike plus seven.

K. Temple sword. Right? Temple sword. Yep.

Oh. Oh, perfect. Okay. Okay. This is good.

This is I'm moving. Here we go. Oh, this looks like one roll I'd make. Yeah. That's stupid.

Alright. Can I do that again? You do have one more attack that you can or you have one more action that you can use. You can use it to attack if you want to, or you could use it to raise your shield to increase your AC. If you do Now we're gonna Okay.

So then you need to do the plus two attack instead of the plus seven. How do I how do I change it? Yeah. On the temple sword, there's there's the next one over. It says plus two math times five.

Yep. Yep. I got it. Holy. If you Now if you would have rolled that for your first attack, you would have hit.

Oh. Twenty twenty two. Alright. Alright. Is that, like, kind of mythic?

Next up is the the bad guy that you ran up to. Uh-oh. He is, he is going to target he's gonna target Karsten, and swing with his scimitar. Billy? He swings, you try to warn him off but he does find a chink in your armor which causes a jolt in your arm.

And he deals five points of damage to cost. Then he's going to take his second action, and he is going to He's going to attempt to disarm he's gonna attempt to disarm Karsten. What a jerk. He he takes a scimitar, swings at your sword as as you, as you try and block it. He knocks the flat of the blade, which causes the the sword to start to fall out of your hand, but you quickly grab hold of it and keep a hold of it and and are able to ward off the attack.

Then after that, he's going to attempt to shove you off of the bridge. Oh, almost. Almost. He pushes against you, but you are but you are able to ward him off as he tries to push you into the sand. Oh.

Then we got goblins. So it rolled a negative 23. Yeah. I'm not understanding that critical failure by negative 23. That's it failed by negative 23.

It rolled a negative five was the reason Yeah. How do you roll a negative five? Because it was just action. Right? Yep.

Exactly. He was out of he was out of negative 10 for the roll. Yep. So oh, and that and that is a good point. He did crit fail.

So as he was trying to push you over, it actually backfired, and you were able to you were able to step out of or step out of the way. Like, you gave a little bit of resistance as he was pushing, then sidestepped, and he fell down. So he is currently That's awesome. Alright. We got, some goblins.

God, these Longshanks. How many do we have to kill? Runs up to, runs up to Cahir, and he will attack, attacks with the dog slicer. He needs to actually target here. Dog slicer.

I'm just gonna attack with his dog slicer and see if he can hit. From which he does, he is able to get, to hit Cahir. As you're as you're getting as you got back up and you're just kind of taking taking, taking stock of what's happened, this little green man walks up with this, what looks to be like a large knife and just kinda stabs you, dealing provide giving you giving you but a scratch, on your, on your beautiful exterior. Beautiful. Beautiful.

Handsome, handsome, handsome half orc man here. Alright. Cahir, you are up. How do you engage someone? Well, right now he's standing he's standing right next to you.

So, you are able to, just turn around and attack him. Yep. Okay. So you started your rage. Go ahead and take that effect rage from the from the chat window, that box, pull it on over to your token.

Yep. All right. You are now raging. So that's one of your actions. Now you need to target him and attack.

Stop rolling fives or lower. Alright. Okay. I miss him, so I'm gonna attack him again with the second one. Yep.

Using the second one, so it's an eight five. Ace. Rams, do you have the do you have the the miss by one guidance? No. I do not.

I do not. By one. Was a I was a psychic thing. I guess. And join the club.

Yep. Starting out strong. Alright. Chris can't control the everybody knows Chris cannot control the rules. Chris, it's not your fault.

Level one. Game's fault. Yeah. And there there's a reason why I'm wanting to bum rush you to level five because, you know, when when you get to level five, you should be strong enough to be able to handle a lot of these a lot of these things without, I mean, bad rolls are gonna be bad rolls, but it'll be a little bit easier. Right.

So the next step is the, the corpse. It's gonna move forward. So it is to move up to Carston. Also, Clark, it should be noted that you do have when you are engaged with, undead, you do have abilities that specifically target undead and specifically damage undead. So that's something to just Yeah.

I had to lay on hands, but I didn't like the damage. So there's something else I'm missing? No. But let but dude, you're level one. Lay on hands is good damage.

Six damage But I is good damage. Don't I get more damage from whacking them with my sword? Depending on how you roll. Is there a difference in your to hit? Using Yeah.

My hands is, it's a touch if you lay on hands, against an undead target, you deal one d six damage, you must and they must attempt a basic four two save. If it fails, it takes negative two stats penalty to AC for a round. Ouch. That's the thing. Like Yeah.

I get one of them. You're not doing you're not you're not doing a ton of damage, but that negative two status penalty to AC is huge. That would make the difference there. That's huge. So that's that's just some some stuff to keep in mind.

So to to touch Chris, was that is that still an attack rule to touch? Let's see here. It doesn't say attack. No. But I'm sure it's one of my Whatever you call it.

Doesn't have an attack role. I'm curious because I've got a spell that I would be looking at using, and it's I would have to do a touch, I think. Well, it says it's range touch, but, well, here, give me one second. Sorry. I'm slowing things down.

Yeah. No. It just happens. It it's a it's a it's a safe spell. So they have to make it forward to it safe.

But it you don't have to but you don't have to You don't have to make a an attack roll. Okay. Correct. So that's just some stuff to keep in mind. Like, because sometimes sometimes it's better to use a status effect than it is to add a status effect than to attack three times.

Because the second time is at negative five, the third time is at negative 10, which means you're already at, like, super negative when you're when you're doing it. So just sometime sometimes even though you can attack three times, it's often not a good idea to attack a third time, especially. Second time is okay, but third time, use something else for the reaction if possible. Just just a second. So the zombie run walks well, walks.

It shambles up to Karsten, and then it will attack with its it reaches out to grab Karsten. It is unsuccessful. Yeah. Which is actually very good for cars. Zombies are scary.

And then the other, the other goblin pulls out a short bow and aims at Samir and shoots. Sameer, you take a one of the arrows grazes your shoulder, taking you take two points of damage. Then I did it automatically. Okay. Yep.

And he's gonna move up and and he doesn't have anything better to do at the moment, so he's gonna take another shot. And he's gonna crit. So he he moves to a better position, fires, and you take and you and it goes from a arrow grazing your shoulder to one hitting you straight in the chest, dealing eight points of damage. Oh. But on the bright side That's not great.

It's your turn. Oh, it's my turn. Now, if you guys could now, if you could, you know, roll above five, Jason, that would be a good one. No promises for him. Please, please, please.

Yeah. Well, I think, I would move myself over to here. So that's one action, I'm assuming. Right? Maybe here.

Anyway, as I am, you know, stumbling, in a a retreat behind a big friend here Mhmm. I will do the runic weapon. You gonna let me do it? Alright. For k.

Here. Do I need to roll anything or it doesn't? Nope. It just happens. So Okay.

Scott, go ahead and pull the spell effect, move the weapon onto your onto your token. Here, there. That is that's that's that's that's not a bad that's not a bad use of your turn right there. Uh-huh. I'm gonna do some big boob boobs.

Don't really I've got one more action that I can take. Yes? No. You the runic weapon cost you two actions, and your It was two. Okay.

That was two. Okay. And then we Yeah. You are at the end of your turn at the moment. Okay.

That's good. But on the bright side, you are hiding behind a big, a big buff fork half Target. So chances are you're not gonna get shot again. There was no AC bonus to, Alwar's thing, was there? No AC.

Just attack and damage. Okay. Didn't see anything change there, so I just wanna make sure. Alright. Oh.

Speaking of Brian. Or Alwar, you are out. Well, we're gonna do yeah. Let's do the thing. We are going to target the goblin in front of Cahir, and, I am going to demoralize him.

So I'm going to shout at him, something effective, you know, hey. Leave my friends alone. I point at you here and say some of the effect of, like, he's gonna get you. And I will try to demoralize him. He has to make a will save.

My gosh. No. No. No. Sorry.

I make him an intimidation. Yeah. I've won against his will. So I will do that. I haven't targeted, so I imagine this is just going to work.

Oh, that was 16. Oh, good. He's exceeded. Success. Alright.

So he is freighted to one now. Alright. I will pull that over. Excellent. So frightened one, for everybody else's knowledge, gives him effectively negative one to everything.

All of his attack roles, his AC, even throw, everything, which is pretty good. That's great. Except he's gonna go before to here. That's not good. Maybe you should have thought that went through a little more.

That's okay. That's what we did. Next up, we are going to, turn to, our friend, Samir, and, say, hey. You're not you're not doing so well. Let me, let me help you out.

And I'm going to cast soothe, which will heal for seven. Seven heals. And did you already apply that, Jason, or did I have the button? No. I did not.

It's not going to automatically do that for me. Right? Okay. No. Alright.

You oh, right. I just need to know when I need to push the button. There is also the spells the spell effect suit. So you can pull that onto your character as well. You it gives you a plus two stats when a sun saves against mental fitness.

So alright. And that's me. That's all my actions. Karsten, you are up. You have a zombie on one side and a skeleton on the other.

What do you do? I first say something mouthy. Like, it takes three of you to take out a goblin, and then I Oh, shit. I'm trying seriously. It's like a small freaking critter.

Then I'm gonna whack at the, prone, undead person. Yeah. Or I'm going to attempt to. Last time, it did not work so well, though. Which undead person?

The one that's prone. Skull. Yeah. Okay. Seems like a good idea.

Curb stomp the skull. Oh, big. Oh, nice. That will do. And There we go.

Just and just so you know, you crit because it was propped. Yeah. Oh, well, that's nice. It it lost it it dropped its AC down to 14, and you rolled the 24. If it was not pro Yep.

You would have just hit it. Yep. So that's Bam. Status. The courageous anthem.

The courageous anthem was adding one. Yes. Yep. Yeah. That is the stacking of effects.

Yes. So, yeah. So go ahead and roll that, roll that crisp damage there, buddy. Is it that right there? Oh, wow.

There's Yep. I got it. I think I think I did it right. I'll take that. Nice.

Right? Yep. That's pretty good. Yeah. It's it's pretty good.

You killed it. So you That's right. As it's as it's on the ground, you you flip the sword around, and you just start stabbing down on the ground, and the bones turn into pieces. And, the magic that is holding the thing together just kind of dissipates. Okay.

Oh, yep. Sorry. Yeah. You've got you've got two more actions. I do.

I will raise my shield. Okay. And then I will So there's actually lay my hands on There there's actually a ray shield action. So you wanna you you wanna click on that so you can pull the the ray shield, effect onto your character to get your plus two armor class. So how the heck do I do that?

In your character sheet? Shield. In the shield section. In the in the actions, you see the sword stealer shield that you have. There's a raise button underneath the strike.

Click on that. Oh, yeah. Okay. I'll do that in a second. I'm going to lay my hands on this hitter.

Okay. I don't know how I don't know how to do that. So you gotta target her. Oh, yeah. Target the target the course.

Okay. And then Yep. Click on layoff hands. Hands. Cast?

Are you cast? Yeah. Cast. Okay. Alright.

And then it's The undead? Versus undead. Yep. And roll damage. Right?

Wait. Don't roll damage yet. Let me roll, let me roll the saving throw first from which it crit failed. Oh, that's frustrating. Gonna hurt anybody's feelings?

Nope. Well, I accidentally had the wrong the wrong thing selected, but still it crit failed regardless. So Oh, then you could do the right one, Juan. No. No.

It's it's fine. I rolled a one, and it didn't matter if I had your tokens selected or that token selected. It would've failed with the others. So Oh, wait. Hang on.

Wrong one. Just a minute. Here we go. Okay. Three on a critical.

If it fails, it takes a negative 2¢ penalty to AC for one round. So it definitely did that. And then it looks like outside it looks like there's no additional thing for that, but it does take double damage because of Critic. So alright. So, yeah, you you you have you, you mold the divine light to playfully in on in in your hands and kind of do a kameyamey a with with with one of the with one of with your sword hand, basically punching the the the zombie creature.

And it takes, it it takes a few steps back. The the necrotic skin begins to just peel and fade, in in its in its chest and now has a big cavity where there wasn't any before. Yeah. And, yeah. And you raise your shield.

Good. Perfect. Alright. So the frightened the frightened goblin is going to, to, scare her, that's for sure. More local creatures, they have a whole lot of options.

Have a whole lot of options. It's going to attack and miss pretty badly. And because it's freaked out, it's got nowhere to go, it's going to continue to attack and miss. And We're getting better. So it basically just lets out this flurry of blows with its dagger and just like it its dagger bounces off your muscles, hits the floor and and whizzes right by right by your, by your torso as it can't get to your head.

And that is its turn. Mhmm. Khair, you are bulked up and ready to go. What are you gonna do? I hope so.

Must attack with all of vengeance. Come on. You hit. I hit. Hey.

And I would like to point out that you hit because you had a runic weapon. Thanks, Sameer, because you had courageous hands up. Thanks, Alwar, and because he was because he was well, I mean, he wasn't he wasn't frightened. Oh, and that's just a normal hit. Yeah.

That's a normal hit. Alright. And you basically you swing your and just just for everybody's reference, he's got a large sized axe. So he doesn't he's got a he's got a great ax that is the size of his entire body that he's swinging around. And he he winds up, does a perfect does a perfect swing.

It's kinda going for the curveball sort of situation, and he lobs that creature, and just chops it in half. Yeah. Bob, time you do something. About time I hit somebody. Right?

Alright. Now it's the zombie. Don't I get more actions or no? No. You do.

You get more actions. That was just one action. Yeah. You got two more. What are you gonna do?

Can I get down to him or no? Oh, yeah. You've got enough movement. Swing it. So I can so that would be my plus four one, my next Mhmm.

Or does it go down to the third one? No. It goes down to the second. It only it only counts the the attack. Per action or per strike.

Okay. Per attack. Alright. So he just works just down to the other goblin. Let me target him.

Yeah. Can target? Oh. You you missed Terrible. You missed by two, but Yep.

Alright. Done. That was still, that was still a very good turn. Now it is the zombie's turn. Zombie is going to stick around with Karsten.

Oh, and this this does remind me, not this specifically, but also one of the things is, like, reactive strikes or tap opportunities are very rare in this game, and something that you can do is move away from the creature that that is going to want to attack you next turn. So it has to waste one of its actions to move towards you, so it doesn't need to attack you as much. So those are some things that you can definitely, to kinda try and make sure that they're not using they're not just able to do whatever they want. But only that costs an action, though. Right?

Yeah. It would cost an action for you to move away. So it's a one for one, but it's effectively like if they're if you're just sitting right next to them, then they can just sit there and just attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, or attack, use a spell, or even that kind of thing. Whereas if they actually have to move, then they might not be able to do everything that they want to enter. You know?

Cool. Alright. So the zombie is going to attempt to grab, he's gonna attempt to grab Karsten. And Karsten, we Karsten pushes it away with its shield with its shield. Yeah.

Yeah. And it's going to come back around and try and latch onto him one more time and has and basically just lurches off to the side and misses it completely. Critical mess. Yeah. On attacks, there's not really anything that happens, but Oh.

Yeah. Because the because the skeleton was trying to push you and shove you, that's why it fell prone you when you did it when you created this. So alright. So the goblin, it's got this big, big, hulking barbarian staring at it in the face. So it's going to first things first, it's gonna target the barbarian.

It is going to switch out its short bow for its dog slicer, which is one action. And then it's going to attack. Oh, good roll. And it's gonna hit, dealing the crook. Close.

Dealing one point of damage. Shit. It's good to hear. It's gonna see what just happened, and it's going to move away. That is its turn.

Sameer, you're up. Would it be I don't yeah. K. I was thinking about this? Like Yeah.

How do I do this? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Excellent. Yes.

That is which thing are you teleconnect projectile? Oh, I'm assuming, this is the assumption, that there is, available loose stone that fell from the collapse Oh, yeah. 100%. Yeah. That I can just kinda oh, hey.

Here's something and, you know, kinda lob it at its face. Yeah. Yeah. And just for the record I don't know if I could fall it off the bridge. But and just for the record, if you cast Hell Connect projectiles, it doesn't matter if you're in a marble room, you find something to flick in.

So it's it's definitely not one of those situation spells that really works when you works when you when you've got rubble. Gotcha. But but you do have lots of rubble around, so you are good. We're good. Alright.

That's that does require two actions. Yes? Yes. Yep. Okay.

And the entire being the zombie bee? Yeah. And this would be bludgeoning. Yes. Because it's a piece of stone.

It can be I mean, I guess piercing, more slashing. Yeah. Because I can see it being a This stone could have a sharp edge that you're piercing it with or could have a long edge that you're slashing. So Yeah. It depends on the stone.

Yeah. You can pick any of those. I can choose. Typically, what I'm, you know, used to is that, undead creatures are a little more responsive to bludgeoning. Is is there anything in this that, like, does the game grant anything for that?

Or is there not really any It it does. The same. It does grant weaknesses, but Okay. You won't know what the weaknesses is are unless you use a action called, called, knowledge. Knowledge something.

Recall knowledge? Yeah. Recall knowledge. Thank you, Ramsey. We use that on such a regular basis.

I can't Right. But, the recall knowledge action will allow you to ask questions about, like, a monster's Gotcha. Or you can just try it out and see what works. Yeah. I I am gonna try the, the bludgeoning to deck.

Okay. Just rolling. Oh, hey. That you know, better than the last time, I think. Yeah.

I punched it in. Let's Hey. So back up to the previous ping and roll damage there. Yes? Yep.

Oh, nice. So Nice. That's pretty good. That's that's bad. Two d six plus one, and you did 10 damage.

That's pretty solid. That's per good. So above average, you, you hammered that you hammered that zombie into the ground. So Hey. The zombie grabs at you and you block it with your shield, and it lunges again, and it misses.

And then all of a sudden, a bunch of rubble just whizzes by your head and smashes the thing to the ground, and it's not getting up. Mhmm. I'll work. We're up. Alright.

Well And the plus one on that was from all wars thing that he had done. Is that where that came from? Yep. Mhmm. Okay.

Yep. Okay. Seeing it. Yep. Sweet.

Okay. Alright. We're gonna not a whole lot to do here, unfortunately. We will yeah. Let's move for one.

Let's see here. This is a distance measurement. Yeah. That's what I want. It's 30 feet from this guy right there.

That's perfect. 20. Perfect. Alright. So cool.

I will, oh, I'm still on measure. Okay. Control. There we go. Well, no.

Like, to actually move. There we go. Did it. Alright. So I'm gonna move up to here for one.

For two, I'm gonna turn to this fleeing goblin and yell after him. Yeah. That's right. You better run. You're next.

And I will demoralize that goblin. Immortalize. Meditation. Very intimidating. Oh my god.

Jesus. Oh. Yes. He's going to himself in the quicksand over there. Frightened two.

And then I'm gonna turn to Cahir, and I'm going to, cast items on him with, my remaining action, and and say, yeah. Go get him, bud. Alright. So, Scott, you can pull on the spell effect guidance onto your character. Right.

Give you a plus one for your, for, plus one status bonus on one attack or perception checks that you throw or skin checks. You will have access to that. Karsten, you have two very dead undead creatures in front of you. Oh, and I do want to also just want to point out that your, that your lay on hands with the zombie, actually did make an effect for the, with the talc connect projectiles. The what?

For Samir's attack, your, yeah. Laying out of humans. Yeah. You're laying on hands. I I I believe, had had an effect on on his on his role to hit.

So Oh, gotcha. Gotcha. Like, I'm I'm doing my best to point out when your stuff actually matters because it actually does. Okay. So those status effects are huge in this game.

So, but, Carson, you are up. You have two dead zone you have two dead undead. It's two real dead things in front of you, and there is a, a goblin that is trying to trying to get trying to escape. What do you do? I mean, I've Hang on.

I will move 25 is it 25 feet? Yeah. You've got 25 feet. I move here, and on my way, I pick up that little tiny short knife from the other goblin that has a splat mark, and can I just whip it at the I I don't know what else to do? I don't have a range weapon.

I don't I don't know if I can get to them and whack them and not have a penalty. Well, let's see here. I just thought If you could move again, it'd be right next to him. Yeah. You can get to him and attack him.

You just Oh, perfect. Move. You can you can use all of your you can use all of your actions from movement. So, like Well, then I turn around and just start screaming. Mhmm.

And then I go to whack the guy. No. That's it. Get him. Alright.

Night. Oh, oh, oh, I don't know what happened. I I don't know. I'm not small. I'm with my character.

Says it's my turn, but it shouldn't be yet. Oh. Nope. I'm going. Alright, Carson.

Whack it. Oh, man. That's a crit. Oh. You're a lacquer.

That's because you want to splatter the goblin. Yeah. Let's do damage a one on that one. Can I do the crit button? Yep.

Do the crit button. Yeah. That guy's gonna eat. He's he's gonna eat some. Weeks of damage.

He's dead. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. So you basically just charge up and swing your holy sword down on this goblin.

Who's trying to figure out how to get the heck out of dodge. And, it does not, it does not, it does not get up. Yeah. Okay. I went away for whatever reason.

Yeah. I don't Alright. So the combat has finished. You guys get a 160 XP for this first combat. Does it automatically go to it?

I don't have to do anything? Correct. Good. Excellent. So you again, you're just kinda taking taking, stock of of what's going on, At you know, as you finish off this combat, it's only been a few seconds since you since you landed, and you start hearing people calling down, from the from the ceiling.

Cahir, Awol, Karsten, Samir, are you alright? Looking up, you see, a few heads poking poking, out, looking looking down the hole. Again, like, the area itself is, like, there's scorch marks all over the place, signs of explosions. There's more undead, that are that are dead, undead, and more goblins than than these. These were just the ones that survived the initial, the initial, event.
