Clarification for you. Oh, dear. Sorry. I'm pissed off. I don't have any clarification other than that.

I was in a temple or we were in a temple fighting, some evil people trying to figure out what the temple held. We completed the quest, and took down a was it a ghost or a not a hag. I always wanna say a hag, but, a ghost or, was it a zombie? Anyway and I don't know. Was it?

I don't remember. She was she was weird. That's what she was. She was weird. It reminds me of there's a movie with a weird A vampire.

Yeah. How come no one else is moving but Ramsay? Oh, there you are. Okay. Everyone's like standing still like I'm talking and hearing you, but, frozen.

After we defeated her, I think we have a quest to figure out how to stop the sands of time from falling out of the hourglass. And after that, you saw a light, which we saw a light, but I'm still trying to understand what that really means. Sands of time. Whose temple is this? I definitely look over at Warwick as I feel like I'm tripping over my set of tools at the moment.

Oh, my gosh. Warwick, you remember the temple? He's talking about you. Oh, Alwar. Warwick, I think it's from a movie.

Who's this? I'll get it. I'll get it. Yes. Yes.

It was, Shanoa's temple, the the time goddess. Very fortuitous. Certainly, usually an omen of some kind. Which we think it moves from place to place and pops up when it's needed. Elle Elwar.

Right? Is it Elwar? Yeah. Okay. He looks slightly confused for a moment and then, like, oh A light bulb.

Oh. That's good. That's what this is? We need to tell, somebody. We need to tell somebody.

Who who who do we tell? Let's see. We have, Jared. No, Jared. Well, we have maybe Jared would be good.

Why do we need to tell anyone? Why do we need to tell anyone at the moment? Because the Temple Of Shanua has has revealed itself. This is Oh, this is big. Big.

This is huge. I need a noun. That's what you're saying. Yes. I'd be happy to talk to whoever you feel.

After I have a now. Just and and Clark, just just for the record, this guy this guy that you're talking to is your is your bitter rival. Oh, well, that's a different story. Why would I tell him anything? Anyway, I was trying to play it off.

That's what I would tell him. Please set up I would tell him, please set up a meeting with who you feel needs to hear this information if they wanna know more. As to specific details, I don't have them at this time. And my team and I will be, figuring out everything Debriefing. Debriefing to give you more specifics at a later time or at a meeting with the council or whoever the council is.

Uh-huh. There you go. Yeah. Currently, there's no council. Mhmm.

But there it and and you know this. This isn't me. This isn't him talking to you. This is GM giving you giving you lore lore dumps. You have a, currently, you have a head of the village by the name of, Eldren Thorn.

He's worked as a he's worked as an elder in in in other villages and he and basically, it's kinda one of those people that, people have a tendency to defer to. Jared, while being the spiritual leader of the village, is not the, actual, like, political leader of the village as well. You it was it was decided fairly early on that it was not a good idea to have, to have one person holding all of that power. So, they decided to split it up amongst two, at least for now. Makes sense.

So yeah. So you you basically, follow the idea. Basically kind of arguing with himself as to whether or not it's something that needs to that he needs to inform the, the religious leader or the political leader about what has happened. And so he's basically just kind of trying to figure that out. You guys are moving on, sounds like.

And, what do you do straight from the hole? It's it's, it's late afternoon. What do you what do you guys what are you guys doing at the moment? I really like out of there. What'd you say?

Said thank whoever pulled us out. Uh-huh. I appreciate that. Don't go down there. No joke.

Not kidding. Don't go down there. It's actually pretty safe right now. Well, yeah. Yeah.

You guys took care of everything. I would I would, I would probably would say, is it possible to take a couple hours to nap, get cleaned up, and then come back and debrief, have dinner, lunch? Like, you know what I mean? Like, do one of those before we order Yeah. Having a having a rest sounds pretty awesome.

Alright. Yeah. I like that. Okay. Do you guys want to just take a nap, or do you wanna, you know, just call it a day, then meet each other the next day?

Or I would be in favor. I mean, I don't know how anybody else is. I I don't need much for sleep. So, I'd be in favor of taking a short nap and doing dinner together. Sure.

What's the barbarian thing? Works for me. We should stay together somehow, not get too far apart based on Chris's comments. Oh, it's fine. No.

You guys can do your own stuff. I'm not trying to I'm I'm just saying don't disappear for five months because I gave you five months to, do the snow. Right? Don't be not a hermit. It sounds like, we're gonna take a rest, clean up, and then meet meet for dinner or late dinner.

Alright. So, you guys are able to, make it back to your dwellings, and basically just kinda, you know, get get yourself all cleaned up, maybe take a little bit of a nap, and then are able to meet back at the sundial shadow, which is the, the one restaurant in the town, restaurant slash tavern. Something that you guys do notice, when you're coming back and coming back to the coming back to meet up for dinner is the, the town is abuzz with, all kinds of rumors about what what this means, what what could the, what could the Temple Of Shenanua is revealing itself mean for, for the town and for the world. And there are much there there's a lot of speculation both good and ill, about what this could mean. It might, there are some people that think that the, the fire retribution may have just been the precursor and now there's something even worse coming along, and there are other people who are, taking it as a good omen of something something good is just around the corner.

And maybe we can learn from the temple, and and its teachings and things. So you do make it to the shadow. When you walk in, it is what you would consider to be just a classical fantasy tavern. There are, it's got polished wood flooring, a number of different, number of different wood tables and chairs. There's a bar in the back.

Nothing nothing too fancy, but it's also only been erected for the past, like, six months. So Right. Everything is relatively new in good order. And, the kitchen, has has decent decent, has decent menu. So, walk in, watch each other's eyes.

I'm assuming, I'm assuming, you know, trying to find a table that's a little bit out of the way or maybe in the middle of everything or Yes. A booth. Go to a booth. Okay. Those are definitely a lot more private.

As you do, people try and wave you down, try and pull pull you pull you into conversations. This was also happening as you guys were walking through the streets and the rumors were flying. Everybody knows that you guys were the ones that went down into the temple. So they're trying to pet your eye, get your attention to see if they can pump you for more information. Okay.

Big damn heroes. Big damn heroes, in fact. Thank you, Charles. So, you guys make it to the booth and settle down. The the server comes by, takes your orders, and, there you go.

What what what do you do? What do you say? I would basically get their thoughts on the whole the whole thing and the where we become I was gonna say Lollapalooza. No. I know.

Right? Every time every time you say that. So I just think of the giant band festival in Chicago. Anyway That's fine. And and what that means and how you each are going to respond to the public about it.

I would share with my I would share I mean, not that we don't know this, my concern, and then I would share that I'm not going to be very forthright knowing what is out there potentially, but not shying away if we get stuck in a battle or something, if that makes sense. Yeah. That makes sense. I'm I'm maybe a little concerned that some of this might be true. I don't I don't know how much sense it makes given what we've learned, what we know about, Raythellian, what we've learned about, you know, surviving the flaming retribution, building this community.

It doesn't make sense to me that his powers would corrupt people. But I think we should be careful and keep an eye on ourselves and each other. You get a solid head nod from smear. What did you say, Jason? So you get a solid head nod from smear.

Oh, yes. And I I you guys just figured out that I do magic, and that's Mhmm. That's not something that I, have ever put forth with, I guess, fluency. Right. Right.

And even even in my using of it in in with you guys, like, there were a few times where you would have had a hard time recognizing that it was specifically coming from me. Yeah. Her magic user is rare? No. No?

Not necessarily. Yeah. It's been a bit of a rough go for me, so I don't put it out there to the public. I won't be putting this out there to the public either. Understood.

Why are you so, hesitant with your magic? Hasn't always been easy to control. Gotcha. That makes sense. Yeah.

Kinda being big and green, I guess I would be afraid that people I want people to see me as a hero and not as a gigantic scary gunny. So Right. I think as people are talking, you know, I I might if if I've got a code, I might hold it closer, and then I might be, like, at some point, getting frustrated by all the attention. Oh. But I want them to know that we're here.

This is somehow too. So Mhmm. But in that, you know, like, we're we're just we're here with everybody else just trying to figure out what are the next steps for civilization. Right? Because they'll let poo poo.

So Yeah. I mean, for for me all on the same team. Yeah. This is where Peter stands up and says, you're all sinners. Mister Clark says, come to this new god.

We'll all turn evil together. I mean, being a bash bastion for Raythellian, it would be that's, kind of my thought. This is very similar to everyone else's. We're just trying to help people survive this big plat cataclysmic event, and that's that's kind of really what it boils down to. Okay.

And this in a lot of ways, this complicates that. Yep. It it it doesn't like, having I lost her name already, but, you know, having this temple show up, and all the garbage surrounding that, like, that that does not simplify the equation at all. So I agree with you. And then why did the temple appear?

And then for me because I, you know, I don't know Why did it choose us? It could have been Raythellian as part of that. Don't know. I mean, that's And then what do we do about the hourglass that needs fixing? I I almost think that that becomes more the the point to focus on, especially from a community level conversation.

Like, I I would almost hypothesize, that maybe it showed up because where else would it go? There's nobody else left on the continent theoretically. And we're it it seems to be in a state of disrepair and need of assistance. Love it. Cover story.

Like, we're trying to figure out like, our task, I would say, next is to try and figure out what, if anything, there is that that we can do, just to I I guess even nothing else, just bring stability. Yeah. Do we also do as we're talking, I will ask, do we have anyone who's I don't know if it's the elders' right term or, like, who's sympathetic to us or we know who's on our side that has more base of knowledge of this god and things like that and the Lalapalu historian or something. I mean, like, Elwar is pretty ancient, but does he have any, like, buddy? That might know more information.

Right. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good question. It makes sense.

Like, we need to do some digging and research. Mhmm. Like, when Gandalf goes back and tries to find, like, the scroll The park once. Yeah. Right.

Figure out what kind of ring it is. Which took a very long time, didn't it? Like, a year. Yes. It yes.

He was gone for a long time. Yeah. Now before it took a better time, like, twenty years for him to for him to actually figure it out. Wait. Just just a side note.

I know we're tangent. Is that because he couldn't find the information? Like, he was looking for the information literally for twenty years? No. Oh, I mean, he's ganned off, so he probably got diverted a few times.

But Yeah. He he hunted down Gollum and tracked Gollum with Okay. Sorry. Aragorn for a a long lot for a couple years or whatever. And then, yep, just get down to Gondor takes a, you know, hot minute.

So, like, yeah. I do like the cover story, Jason, that you're talking about though too. So Yeah. Makes sense. Figure this out.

Mhmm. Yeah. But for for Ramsey's memory help, I forget. What is the deal as far as we know with the hourglass being cracked or whatever? Because I don't honestly remember that.

Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm starting with that too. Problem.

So in the, in the main, in the main sanctuary Mhmm. The hourglass, that has the sense of time that that are flowing through it. If you remember the, if you remember the there was a a story that you guys found, part one and part two of the story, talking about the sands of time and how they are and how they are used to and how like, basically, it's it's let me let me grab the things here. So the legend of the great Time Turner, the temple, The time turner, was basically made by Shanua herself, fashioned from the sands of time imbued with her celestial actions. It's written in the turner, it's written that the turner is the heart of temporal harmony.

It its gears and cog cogs perfect imperfect concord with the celestial spheres, thus does not ensure the thus does it ensure the unceasing flow of time in orderly march of days. So the the time turner itself is basically kind of the essence of time itself. And the time the time turner has a huge gaping hole in it, and the sands of time are flowing out of it at the moment. Gotcha. Yeah.

That's that's probably bad. Yeah. Bad juju. So it'd be nice if we get, like, Scott out. I mean, if we could find someone who knew maybe a little bit more and then kinda start digging into our prayer, you know, I don't know, maybe Raytheon will kinda lead us where to go.

So, and also just kind of like, to give Scott, like, for Kier, as far as, like, people who are on your side in general, this this entire community is is a group of people who are rallying together to be able to kind of, to be able to, survive and also potentially, you know, save the rest of the world. That was kind of the that was kind of the value add, that was that was given to you by Jared when he when he pulled everybody up was a we need to go up. There's a great catastrophe that's coming so that we can come back and save come back and save the world itself. So generally, everybody is pretty on your side. Now you add the La Palouse side of things, and that makes it a little bit more complicated.

But, generally, this is a bunch of people that are kind of, like, more more, more incentivized to help out with things. Yeah. And then my and then I'd also bring up my other concern is if word spreads at this particular temple is here, what kind of other, interesting characters will be wanting to take a look or engage, you know, the dark side more or less? You know, what is their gonna be response be? Gotcha.

I mean, do we know of any other communities of people that survived yet? Or is it because we've only been here for, like, a year. Right? And we escape by the skin of our teeth. I don't know we've been We don't I don't think we know.

Yeah. That's correct. Yeah. Well, there's not really anywhere that we know of the word to get out who. Mhmm.

Correct. We are exploring like everyone else. Yep. Okay. Cool.

Cool. So, yeah, I I'm not too scared about having more to get out in our little community about the temple and try to find some more information or someone who might know more. Right. So that meeting does get set up with the, I would imagine the the spiritual leader whose name I've forgotten, have the best information. Yeah.

Or direction or, you know, anything. Yeah. I agree. Do we live relatively close to one another? Like, I really don't wanna Yeah.

The community isn't huge. So, it's probably about the size of maybe a little bit bigger than Concord. Okay. That's right. That's not Who's the spiritual leader again?

Jared? Yep. He Yeah. From Subway. That's his cell.

I hope not. Ramsey. Not not Ramsey. Not Ramsey. Clark, you always ruin the names of the things.

No. Because I have to remember them all. I don't do it on purpose other than trying to remember all the different names. So, that's this title at soccer because it was, like, the second day, and I had to figure out all these kids' names. I signed them WWE wrestler names, like, if it was, like and so that's how I remember their names.

So this is how I have to do it. I remember them. I don't do it on purpose other than, actually, a lot of people. What was their name again? Anyway, it helps me remember.

Facebook. Over here. Right? No. Like, we have we have one kid named John, so I'm like, John three sixteen, but I'm like, well, that's not a wrestler, but Austin three sixteen is.

So I don't know. Start doing that. Anyway Yeah. Fantastic. Don't look at it.

I'd say we drink our fill, have a good time. I think we'd talk and then try to set up a meeting with Jared. See? Jared to talk about kind of more information about the temple and keep it on the DL. Okay.

Sounds good. Anything else that you guys wanna do tonight? Can you just remind me what are the differences? The Sand of Time person and then the deity's names again? Shananuha is the, deity of time, and Raythellian, is the deity of creation and lights and the creator deity.

He's basically the real god. Everybody else is a, is a creation of him. So the real god and then there are the subreal gods or Okay. The they they're all different representations of of him. So it's kind of a weird dichotomy.

But Clark's deity is Raytheon. Right? Mhmm. Mhmm. Mhmm.

So there's a whole people that love Raytheon, but he's the one that we're shining from, and that's a bad thing. Well, so here okay. So here's the thing. Nobody knows that La Palu are are are bastions of Raythellion. They just know that they've got superpowers and they kill people.

But we know that. Right? Yeah. No. Well, if No.

No. No. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

So we contextualize maybe what I was thinking. What I said Oh, I'm sorry. No. No. No.

You're fine. No. That's great. That's that's good to know. So so I think the most reasonable thing for us to interpret is that these powers somehow just came from Shenandoah, from the time temple and the time goddess.

Possibly. Yeah. Is is likely what I'm thinking. Yeah. That's why I was thinking.

It's safer to be on that deity right now. So and in in in general, people, while they know who Raethalion is, most of the people in this world do not actually worship Raethalion. That's kind of the one thing that made the, the sun, the blessed realm unique. They don't like, everybody else kind of respects Raphaelian and that kind of thing, but nobody, like, is, hockey enough, I guess, to worship him directly, except for, you know, except for the blessed realm. So, I don't know if I got that across in my big write up that I did.

And even if I did, maybe maybe it was glossed over. But that's that is one of the things that makes the the blessed realm and the people from the blessed realm specifically unique in the world. People don't really worship Raythellian. They worship the other gods, but they don't worship Raythellian. Gotcha.

Okay. Okay. So my character will struggle with that if it's not from Raythellian only because why would another god give it to me? Does that make sense? I mean, like, honestly, you can interpret it any way you want.

Oh, perfect. Like, our word could be our word could be, like, this came from Shanua. You could be, like, you you know, you're a super religious zealot. Right? So you can be, like, my god gave this to me.

This is clearly Raythellion. I just can't confirm it, though. Right? Is that the the difference? We just can't confirm it.

Yeah. Gotcha. That's all I need. Okay. Yeah.

Well, I was thinking we knew it came from Raythellion, but we're just from a public perspective keeping it on the DL that it's Like, your characters can interpret it any any number of different ways. Right? Okay. So, like, if it makes more sense to your character of, like, well, I was in the Temple Of Shanua. I got the powers in the Temple Of Shanua.

Then it's coming from Shanua. That's fine. But also, like, I mean, what was what was displayed as your first power that came from you was that you were shining like the sun. So Yeah. You could be like, well, clearly, this is Raythellian right here because, like, it's making me shine like the sun.

You know? So, there are a number of different logical leaps that your character could take as far as, like, where they're getting this power from. And I don't think any one of them doesn't make sense. Sure. But we don't have anybody on the blessed union of souls.

It's okay. That's a clue. He would the blessed realm. That would be, like because that douchebag that Clark was talking to kinda, like, trying to figure out what we were doing, and he wasn't you know? I'm just wondering, should we go there and see if we should talk to this Jared and and do all that stuff?

Yeah. So Jared is a recognized spiritual leader of the community. So if you have any spirituals Yeah. If you have any spiritual or deep fake questions, he's generally probably the person that you'd wanna talk to. He's helped out in Raphaelion?

Yeah. He is a priest to Raphaelion. And he is the person that basically, caused this community to happen because he had a vision of what was to come. And he basically convinced everybody to move up here before the funding contribution happened. Sorry.

I'm asking so many questions. I'm just trying to No. No. Abs dude, we are we are we just started this game, and we haven't met for more than three times. And on top of that, we've we've had, like, a month between each time.

So I expect us to I expect us to have these conversations pretty heavily, at least at least for the time being. Once you guys get it once you guys once we're more on the regular, I don't think that we'll have nearly as much of questions around the sort of stuff. But Yeah. Yeah. Good.

I'm with you. I agree. Alright. So, you guys finish off the night, finish up eating, and and start and and head back to your homes. Wake up the next day with the intention of going and chatting with Jared.

Is there any does anybody wanna stop me and say, woah. Woah. Woah. I'm doing x, y, and z. Okay.

Nope. I don't think so. So alright. Cool. So you get back home.

You rest the night. Wake up the next day. Almost feels like it's kind of a little bit of a feels like it was almost a dream what happened to you the day before. Get up, get get dressed, get ready to go. And, you know, you almost convince yourself that, that yesterday didn't happen.

And then you look out your window and you see the giant hole in the center of town. And you're like, oh, okay. I guess this is still a thing. And you get up, get out, and, does anybody have any, like, morning rituals or anything that they wish to perform at this point? Yep.

I'll be doing the morning first. Yep. Centering, focusing, whatever it is, what you call it. Okay. Lots of push ups.

Yeah. Lots of push ups. You're doing your morning preparations just in a different way. Yeah. Okay.

So you guys get out. You have you you basically, I guess, where where did you where do you wanna meet the next day? Like near the hole, back at the tavern? I thought we could meet at the, at at the at Jared's place. The temple.

Yeah. Yeah. At the temple or wherever they're at or tent. That seems Okay. Alright.

So you head over to the, the the makeshift temple. You don't really have a full temple, at this point. It's kind of just more of a glorified house. Go up. Knock on the door.

The servant answers, says, hello. Can I help you? Yeah. We are here to see Jared, and we have a few questions for him. Oh, yes.

I think he will. Master said you might stop by. Please, our Karsten, Zahir, Samir, come in, and he waves you into the house. You go into, the it's like I said, it's a glorified house, but the entrance hall is, basically where a majority of the worship services themselves take place. It looks kind of more like a, like a schoolhouse in, like, a, like, Little House on the Prairie style thing.

You've got benches with you've got benches just kinda lined up. There's a, a main row. And then at the front, there's basically a a a pulpit, that Jared basically speaks from. But, you know, nothing too fancy at this point. It's, again, just been a year and there and there's been more important things to be spending time on than making than making a temple look fancy.

So Jared's been very pragmatic with, his improvements that he's had to the to the temple itself. He, he, as you go go up the main the the main line, Jared, comes out of the out of the door in the back behind the pulpit and says, oh, I was I was wondering what I would see you for. Please, please, come in. And he waves you into the back. As you go into the back, there's basically it's it's an office.

So he has, five seats set set out, in a circle formation. He's takes a seat down, and on one of them, they are wooden seats, so nothing terribly fancy. Better than a stool, but not much. And he sits down and says, please, sit. Let's talk.

Thanks. Have a seat. After everybody sits down, he he sits back, crosses his leg, looks at you all, and says, so the Temple Of Shenanua, that is something new. What can you tell us about the temple? We found trouble, in a whole bunch of Kuki people.

Don't really know what they were doing, if they were trying to pillage it. Don't really know all the details of why the temple appeared where it did. It seems from our understanding that it moves around. So why did it move here? What does that mean?

And then do you have any information on it that would help us understand maybe its purpose? Well, all of that will come in good time. But did you find in the temple? The only thing we found He he is clearly not interested in going through your laundry list of things that you want him to tell you. So he's wanting he's trying to initiate a conversation to to to talk to process through what you've just gone through.

Right. But he wants to talk about what he wants to talk to you about, which is not necessarily what we want. He is the religious leader of this community, and he's very highly respected by everyone, including the solar sentinels. So Correct. I guess I get since things have shifted for us, and I get just very cautious.

So I don't really know what to say or not to say. I'll just say, the only thing we really found was a giant hourglass that's cracked and broke and leaking. That was the major thing. Unless I missed the major find. That was a major find.

I see. Because the temple is broken. I I don't is the hourglass the temple? If that's the case, then yes. It broke.

How do you we were trying to figure out how The hourglass is the purpose of the temple. If the hourglass is it doesn't exist, then the temple doesn't exist. Ergo, the temple is broken. What else did you find in there? It wouldn't take more than five minutes to walk through that temple and find a broken hourglass and come back out.

You were in there for hours. Well, there was a a there were some traps Goblins? Dangers and a whole lot of goblins. Lots of kinda few undead people. Yeah.

And At least one zombie. We thought that the amount of goblins was odd as well, but there were tons of goblins. Like, they were looking for something or yeah. I don't know. Yeah.

He couldn't tell if they were trying to loot the place or if if they had something else specific they were trying to get after. See. The goblins, I can't explain. However, you said they were undead as well? Correct.

Yeah. That's that is concerning. If the, if the temple is broken as you've just told me and there are undead that are inside that temple, then that would mean that there is a time paradox that is starting to happen. Undead can occasionally in in time situations where time itself is broken. There is a chance that the undead could be that the time that time itself attempted to reverse a corpse, but there was no spirit left in that corpse to be able to bring life to it.

And so it became a, so it became a creature of death even though it was reanimated to be, to be a creature of life. We cannot bring the sword back to the corpse if we're just reversing the time that it the the reversing the moment of death. Oh, time zombie? Correct. That's what I'm hearing.

Alright. What? Cool. That's You just say a time zombie? Yeah.

Yeah. That's new. Yeah. So yeah. So, basically, he's he's saying that if time is reversed on a body, but there's no soul to live in it, then the body itself becomes an undead creature.

That makes sense, I guess. I can attest. It's at least as as bad as a necromancy. You know? So Hey.

Magic. Magic world. No. I'm saying, like, it's it's, like, it is as critically horrible that this would be going on as if someone were trying to reanimate Right. Right.

That either scenario, that is not good. But this but this is extremely important. Should we have any deaths in the community, we must make sure that those deaths that those people are as far from that temple as feasibly possible, at least while it's still here. Or until we can find some way of being able to repair the damage. Otherwise, we ourselves might find ourselves we we ourselves might find it, find ourselves in a situation where there where we are overrun by members of the community who have who who have died or, or worse.

And that doesn't sound good. This is good to know. Yeah. Yeah. I will I will inform the, the the village elder.

You know, for I will inform Eldarin of the situation. Fortunately enough, I do not believe that anybody right now is on the brink of death, but, you never can be, too careful. You said goblins. Mhmm. All possible.

There's also a lot of passageways that threw us off. There was so many passages to toward the temple. Passages toward the temple. Okay. Mess of mess of goblins, many passages.

Temple just read temple just appeared. There were zombies inside. One of them was a giant. Giant? A giant zombie?

Yeah. How tall was that thing? He looks over at the rest of the crew. I mean, everyone's big to me. Yeah.

That's your I mean, technically, everything's big to you, but, you know Exactly. And I chuckle. My character does chuckle. Is it, like, eight foot tall, ten foot tall? What was it?

Yep. Like, look. It could here. It was taller than you. By how much?

Yeah. I can't remember. It was, like, a 20 foot tall. Oh, 20 foot tall. Oh, okay.

So you were hacking it off at the knees. Alright. So let's see. Who would have been who would have been buried in that temple that was 20 foot tall? It's a great question.

Strange things happen in the Temple Of Shanaenua. Strange things happen. Something that Samir, just because you you just said that, like, the door that you walked through where the 20 foot zombie was inside Mhmm. Was like a seven foot tall door. Okay.

The regular size door with a 20 foot tall zombie inside. Yeah. Which is part of his concern is that, like, there was this 20 foot somebody who lived in the temple. Like, that's very disconcerting. It's possible.

There there are many there are many there are many magical, many magical means of enlarging a person and maybe even perhaps a zombie. So, that could have been some sort of magical engorgement charm or something. Well, I think that it I think that it is clear, gentlemen, that at the very least, you four have been chosen for something great. The temple didn't reveal itself to everyone in the town. It revealed itself to you.

So there must be something that, there must be something that you have been touched for. When you say that, it's just crazy. At the very least. Yes. Kinda stare at a few of the guys like, oh, boy.

That makes sense? Because we were literally touched, but I don't say that. Yep. He's definitely not doing, like, the Dumbledore week. I know what you're I know what's going on with you guys thing.

But he is choosing his words very carefully. And he is also believed to be a prophet. So it's possible he knows more than what he's letting on. It was possible that he's just very choosy with his phrasing. Okay.

So the temple is broken and it revealed itself to you. We ourselves cannot just up and move again. We just found this place, and this is by far some of the this is by far the the best place that we could build our community I agree. That we've that we've seen since the Fleming retribution. It would be a shame for us to take the past year's worth of hard work and, and lose it all because we have to, move away from the temple's temporal, problems.

And nothing to say it wouldn't follow us. Well, who's to say it wouldn't follow us indeed. So I would I would ask you for to find a way to, to fix the temple. Bring it back to its bring it back to its state that it needs to be in in order for it to be able to function correctly. If the sense of time do do indeed run out, then time itself will run out.

And we will all be doomed even more than what we already have already even more than what we already have been. Will you accept this, this quest? I can't speak for everyone, but I think that's kinda what we already had in mind. Agreed. Our big question is is how.

I don't know if you have any idea what where to even start. I was was hoping you may have heard or studied or knew anything that could help. Well, I I can I can tell you some things? I do not have all the answers, but I do have some. I would say that's, the glass of the, of the hourglass is not just regular glass that's made up, you know, made out of sand and boiled down to become clear.

As you may have already surmised, these these the the glass itself is, made of some sort of, crystal, some sort of magical crystal. I'm not sure from where. But in order for in order for us to be able to repair it, and we are definitely willing to do our part in the community. We don't expect you to just gather, you know, just just fix it yourselves. But in order for us to be able to repair it, we would need to have, we would need to have some of that material.

There would also need to be a few, few pieces of star metal that we could use, to be able to fuse star metal, to be able to fuse the shards that are already there, together. Sounds easy enough. Go to the stars, get some metal. Not just any metal. Star metal.

It's it's I love it. It's a it's a special substance that is generally used in in magical rituals of repairing. Obviously, like, obviously, we wouldn't be able to get, the enough of the crystal. I'm not even sure what sort of crystal that is, but we would not be able to get enough of that crystal to be able to repair the whole as you described it. So we would have to reuse some of the shards that are already there.

And the way that we would be able to do that is by obtaining star metal, melting it down, and basically fusing fusing the edges fusing the edges of the glass together, using that using that material. And then we would need to figure out some way of being able to take the sense of time that have already escaped and return them. How do you where do you find star metal? Oh, you used to be able to find star metal. And, used to be able to find it in the blessed realm.

As far as where it is now, and there may be some in there, or it may have become or or it may have been scattered, amongst the, maybe scattered amongst the stars or not the stars. Maybe scattered amongst the the the continent itself. I will have to see if I can get back with you to see if I can find, a way being able to track it. I'm certain there's a way. I myself am no I I myself am no minor.

So I am not sure exactly what how what methods need to be followed in order to be able to find, star metal, but I'm certain that there's somebody here that would be able to find it. Or maybe I might be able to find something about that in in some of my in some of my books I've been able to save. So maybe we Oh, go ahead. I was saying maybe we need to go back and look for some shards, maybe get a few more clues, and help kinda direct us. A lot of time.

I well, I I would definitely say that the, that the temple itself probably has a few more secrets to reveal. If you do a little bit more digging around the, trying to trying to find the, do some more digging around the, Time Turner itself, you might be able to find something that would be that that would give you a clue as to where, the glass itself was what the glass itself was made out of. I'm assuming it's some sort of crystal, but it might not be. I do know that it's that it's rumored that it is not that the glass is some sort of, mystical gem. But, if you happen to have somebody who knows who knows gems and or alloy, in, you know, amongst you, you might be able to get some more accurate, idea about what's what what is what is different.

As as I said, I'm I'm no minor, but, I just know what rumor says. I think that sounds like a good leap for us to go check out. More goblins. Hopefully not. Although, to your point earlier, Jared, about bodies around the temple, Should we it will probably take more than the four of us can do quickly.

Should there be a community effort to get the goblin corpses out of there and disposed of before they can turn? Oh, my heavens. Yes. Yes. We yes.

We need to remove those as soon as possible. I didn't need I didn't even think about that. Yes. We need them on. If assuming that we haven't assuming that they haven't come come back already.

Carson, I would say, Carson. Yes. One moment. He walks back over to his desk. He writes down a message.

He walks up walks back over to you, hands it to you, and says, please give this to your superior. K. And he says, here I was here I was just enjoying our conversation, but it seems that time is of the essence at least for for the moment. Please do Oh, really? Please do take this take this to your commander, Karsten, and we need to be removing those bodies as soon as possible.

Great. We're gonna have to fight more goblins. Oh. Yeah. Yeah.

Not more. Just the same ones again. Right. That's what I mean. Hey.

I will head out immediately. Okay. You head back to your, your barracks. Happened across, one of the one of the superiors that is, that is on duty. He says, Carson, what are you doing here?

Thought you were going to talk to Jared. I we did or my It's over. Did. But he gave me a note to give to you, and I think it's of the most the utmost importance that you read it. I think we might have an issue with the Chattanooga temple, in turning living things into dead things and those dead things arising.

But I don't know For sure. If you're they then I hand them the piece of paper, and I said we have a mission to go and, check out some things in the temple, and I think the townspeople will be gathering to help get the dead things out of there. Alright. So he takes it he he he takes it he gives you a little bit of a, you know, little bit of a look. He's just like, that was way longer than it needed to be.

And then he's, you know, he's like and then as he reads the as he reads the note, his eyebrows just kinda skyrocket to his to his eyebrows hide behind his hairline. And he's like, oh, so you weren't pulling my leg. Close closes it, basically runs back into the barracks, grabs every available, solar sentinel, and they and they all start hightailing it double time to the hole. As as the rest of you, like, make it back to the hole, you you do notice that there are some guards that are posted around it. It definitely was not one of those things where people just kinda left the hole there and that sort of thing.

There is the beginnings of a, the beginnings of a, scaffolding that is being built, around the hole as well, by, the by one of the local carpenters. And as you guys are just kinda get there, start taking in your, taking in your your, taking in the scene, Carl and, the rest of the of the solar sentinels come running up to the hole. And they, and then he, the the manager basically starts taking charge and has people, like, lowering, lowering themselves into the hole, and says, alright. Well, you guys have your jobs. We've got ours.

And he basically just kinda waves you in, waves you on. There are some, there are some reps for you to be able to kinda climb down climb back down in in there to fulfill your specific goals. You make it down there. Thankfully, all of the all of the bodies that were dead continue to stay dead, at least for this moment. And so the solar sentinels are basically just kind of, you know, rounding up the bodies, tying them up on ropes, and having people hoist them up, and that kind of a thing.

So We should go back in and do some investigating. Right. And you just start with the 20 foot body somehow? I can't get that one out first. Oh, well, hopefully, I'm done.

We'll not be re undoubted. Right? I mean, undoubted can happen. Alright. Well, it's timey wimey bullshit.

So who knows? Alright. Alright. So you guys are back in the temple. And like I said, solar sentinels are just basically kind of running back and forth, you know, just kind of combing the combing the temple for, four dead bodies.

It is as you remembered it. So, in order for you guys are just going straight up to the, straight up to the time chamber. So Wait. Is that the big chamber at the end? Oh, yeah.

Up there. Yep. Yep. Okay. There you go.

So you walk into this in the chamber. Everything is very well lit right now. It it is apparent that over the course of the past, past couple of hours slash, evening that, you know, there were some people that did come down come back down and kinda, like, take a look at take a look at things. They found sconces. They put up torches.

So you have way better lighting than what you had before. Excellent. So inside this, inside this temple, in temple room, you do see to the, to the left and to the right, there are things that look like sarcophagus, but in all actuality, they are more along the lines of, like, like, altar prairies, that kind of thing. Like, you know, a place for you to be able to kneel in order to be able to to use, request a prayer. As you walk by the, the undead that you had, that you had previously dispatched here, they, definitely are a lot more, they're a lot more, decayed than they were yesterday.

It seemed like there was some sort of magic that was holding them together. And now that that magic has dissipated, they're kind of starting to decay at an at at a rapid pace. The one that you the the the one that was giving you so many problems, had has a priestesses garb on. And the other two were, appeared to have the livery of a of temple guard. So those may have been the final, the the final priest priest priest inhabitants of that temple.

Gotcha. So you you are here to investigate. Uh-huh. We are. I would like to investigate.

What what are you specifically going to be looking at, and how are you specifically going to be looking at it? Or if you don't have any specific ideas, can you give me some generalities so I can point you towards a more specific idea? I I would like to, look at the crystal that's on the floor or as many giant crystal shards as possible so that we can find the star metal. And I do have crafting, so at least I can kinda figure some things out. Oh, it's untrained.

But still, that's what I would be looking for is the the crystals or the maybe look at what might have broke it. Like, what's the crack how it was broken. Is there pieces that were, like, cut, or was it smashed, or was it magic? Yep. And can we stop it from leaking, like, temporarily?

Yeah. We do a path work. A cup less? Okay. So in order to be able to, for an untrained craftsman, I would say that you would be able to look at the glass shards and figure out how many of them, if if you can jigsaw them together.

Like, if you can puzzle them together, if all the pieces are are there, or if there's anything that's missing. So if you're untrained in craftsmanship and you're wanting to do something related to that, then that's that's what you'd be able to do. If you're trained in craftsmanship, you can do a, I you can do a role to Mhmm. Figure out what sort of what sort of material the glass itself is. Is anyone trained in that?

I am. Oh, okay. Jason is. Jason is good. Well, we're both good.

Let's give it a go. Yeah. Then you should roll. I'm not trained to roll. Rolling crafting.

Just roll a regular roll, Chris? Yeah. Just regular roll. Let's not do me any favors. Hey.

That's not bad. Why is it black? Oh, normal. That that one isn't very good. It's normal.

It is normal. You're right. Should let you go first, Jason. I no. It's it's it's all good.

Okay. So, Samir, you are not able to figure out exactly what sort of material this is. It is very clear that it is not glass at all. What, what Jared said, about it being the about it being some sort of gem does definitely track. Like, it you can see, like, the crystalline, like, you can see the the the way that the glass itself was, like, formed.

It was almost like it was grown, as a crystal rather than something that was, rather than something that was, that was melted down and and molded. You know, it was basically grown into the position that it is. Almost as if as somebody who has spent some time in the Elven community, it's it's very similar to, like, in how an elf grows a house out of the tree. Singing to the tree to cause it to to grow in a certain way to make it into a habitation is a very similar sort of vibe that you get from this crystal. Okay.

Yeah. One second. What happened? You had to go somewhere. On the bottom of the hourglass is where it just seems broken.

Right, guys? Is that, like, that middle bar thing cut? Does that look cut to you guys? Or is, like, a sharp edge on both sides, or is that just the way it's supposed to be? I think it's supposed to be cracked.

I don't know. Yeah. But I I don't I was thinking that whole thing would go all the way around. I like Oh, that bar. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. I see what you're saying. That big bar in the middle? Yeah.

I think the sand's covering it. No. I mean the middle one. It's, like, a sharp edge on the pillar on each side. Oh, it's not.

Oh, I see. At the top. Or right in the yeah. In the middle. Yeah.

I don't know. That's a good question. We can explore that, I guess. What's that building? Is that the actual temple inside us?

Oh, that's a great question. How do we miss it the first time? I'm ready for a nap. I just want you to know that. Yeah.

I mean, a real one. I'm tired. I don't know. Right. Right.

I had today off too, didn't you? I did, but we traveled, from Oregon home. I worked in the car the whole time. Yep. So that's three and a half hours.

Praise Jesus that, we were going through Lansing and traffic stopped suddenly. And my wife went to stop, and she avoided an accident. So that was nice. That's always good. Yep.

I was thinking Jesus because I didn't flint, so my computer would have been shoved in my, probably, throat. Right. Right. Mhmm. And our car is okay.

Yeah. Yeah. Is it just around the construction stuff going on there or what? Yeah. It's where they're redrawn.

Tight. Yeah. It's way too small in my opinion. I agree. Like, the lane lanes are super tight there.

They are. And I I was like I reminded Aaron. I'm like, hey, traffic's gonna slow down. You need fence, you know. And then I guess everything was moving quickly, and then it stopped real quick, and she had to swerve to the right to avoid giant accident.

Anyway, I was thankful. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Alright.

I'm back. Sorry, guys. Oh, good. So and so, Kahir, what you found out, you this crystal is definitely something, definitely something that that you haven't really worked with before. But in your in your research for for your, smithing business, you have run across a, you've run across a specific, type of gem that appears to have the same properties as this one.

It's called it's called a chronoprism. This this specific gem is actually, forged, out of the, of the essence of time itself. It's not able to be, harnessed for much as far as, like, being able to, being able to build, effective weaponry or armor, which is kinda why it's not really your thing. You know, you're more of a, you know, you're more of a battlesmith sort of person. And this seems to be a little bit more froofy and that kind of thing.

But some things that really did catch your eye when you were reading about it was that it is a, it's a gem that is forged through some. And it's forged through the song, through one of the lines of the but, give me a second, Chris. Yeah. I'm I'm looking it up. Oh, what is even what's the word?

It's pronounced weird. Llano? It's kind of a Spanish l. Yeah. Yeah.

As soon as you stop, I'm like, oh, I know what's happening here. Yeah. The llano. Yeah. Yeah.

So there's there's a song of creation, by the, for the life of me. I can't find it. Why can't I find it? You you you gave me you gave me the word Ramsey, but I'm not, Yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. It's it it is pronounced like llano. It's, l l a n o, I believe. They are pronounced kind of like, I said, like like Spanish l's with a Okay. Y ish sound.

Is that the, correct is the correct spelling? Where? Sorry. Oh, I I put in Discord. Oh, Discord.

Gotcha. That's why I was looking at the other doohickey. I don't see chat real. Yeah. It's inside the game night chat.

Yeah. Okay. Open chat. There we go. Yes.

Yes. Correct. Yes. Okay. So it you you basically it kinda it kinda struck you as odd because it was basically something that can be forged and can be forced but it's forced through song.

There's there's the there's this song called the piano. You don't really know much about it but, through the singing of that song, you're you're able to grow the crystal, and and basically create create the crystal. The crystal's main, the crystal's main purpose is it creates like, if you have a vessel that's made of this crystal, it basically contains or it pretty much makes whatever it is that's contained inside it, puts it in stasis effectively. Like, it just it's in it's in a time stasis, so it will never grow, never never shrink, never shrivel, never decay. It'll just stay in the, in the same state that it always is.

But, yeah, all you all you know, Kahir, is that there's a song called Ayano that in singing it will grow this crystal. Oh. It's off of your, alloy alloy lore. Nice. So I'd obviously share that with everyone and ask, hello, do I know the song, Chris?

You do not. Nobody knows the song. Oh, it's a rumored song. Dang it. Yeah.

It is it is in fact you share that. Elwar's eyes kind of brighten. It it is in is in fact, part of the the reason, the quest, I guess, the the driving force, when when Cadence, the god of music gave me the vision that led me here, was to find, the the missing bits of the Anno. I've encountered pieces here and there, notes, phrases. That's that's what empowers the magic I do, but not complete sections, let alone the whole thing.

But certainly, that makes sense that it's capable for doing that. And now may be a good time, Chris. I don't have any crafting or any specific, traditional skills or lore that would be super helpful here. However, upon level two, I picked up Bardic lore, which essentially gives me all lore. Oh.

So it's there. It acts as like a lower powered version of any lore skill. So if there's any applicable lore here, theoretically, bardic lore could help me out. And the way I kind of see that for my character is less like traditionally, it's a, hey, I've studied and learned these things. You know, I've picked up bits of knowledge through my travels and, you know, whatever.

And certainly part of that, definitely works with with my guy in my character. But I also see sometimes some of it being like a direct, you know, like, almost like a a divine, like, word of knowledge kind of thing. You know, being connected either to, Cadence or now, Shenanua, take your pick. That's kinda how that way I thought along with the traditional, you know, I'm 300 years old and I have to travel the world and, you know. Blah blah.

Yeah. That that sounds that sounds good to me. So why don't you go ahead and roll Bartiklor? My question is And you roll better than Jason. How?

Well, the question is, how do I do that? Because I don't think it shows up as a proficiency. It does not. Let me check the actual feat. Bartic lore.

You can create a bardic lore, special lore skills that can be used only to recall knowledge, but on any topic. Okay. Lore skills. Okay. Maybe I just add one.

There we go. Okay. That works. Bardic lore. And we are trained in bardic lore.

That is amazing. And it is plus six. Yeah. Plus six. That's correct.

Bam. Yeah. Solidly average. Okay. Oh, I lose somebody.

Okay. So, with what with what Kahir has shared Okay. And what Sameer has shared, you and and what Jared has talked about as well. You are pretty certain that, and, you know, just kinda looking at all of the all the pieces here that are all together, you're pretty certain that there is a couple of a couple of different ways to attempt to fix this. Mhmm.

One is kind of like the, the method that Jared was referring to, which is more of like, what's the there's a Japanese pottery. There's a Japanese pottery style of fixing fixing pottery in which you basically take gold and you, melt it down and put it on on the edge of the pot of the pottery and then you put the two pieces together. Mhmm. And then that kind of fuses it together and so you have, you know, so you fix it, you put it together, but you but it's very clear that it was broken because it has, like, you know, metal sticking around. Yep.

And so the star metal the star metal route would fix, would fix this. And it would fix it with, with kind of that spidery web sort of sort of situation. You're pretty confident that you see all of the pieces here. So there isn't there isn't anything that's missing. Okay.

That's that's good. You also think that if you find, the right verse, the Janu, you could completely repair this of just growing it growing the the glass back together again. Alright. Yep. By singing to it and just it would it would cause the glass to, like, grow together and close.

Alright. That's gotta be here somewhere. The, the sand itself, if you do it the first method, you will have to find a way to, get the sand to kind of siphon siphon back in. From which you can there there are a number of different magical methods that you could use in order to be able to kind of, like, move it around. Even though the sand of time in and of itself is very significant and it's magical, it's it's it's at the end of the day, it's still sand.

Right. So, you you would have to figure out some way being able to do that. With the with the piano, you are confident that it would just kind of, like, be it would just kind of correct itself as part of the song. Sure. Now obviously, the quicker of the two methods is the first one.

Mhmm. That would definitely get it done quicker. And the, the longer the the longer one, but the better fix would be the would be the second one. So maybe there's an argument for patch job initially and then basically being able to maybe make it better, may maybe do the correct fix later. There was a question that was brought up, about what caused this, and, I think I want everybody to make a perception rule for figuring that one out.

But so that's that's what you got from your party floor. Sounds great. Alright. Perception. Yeah.

Not bad. Not bad. Personal actor. Is that just like rolling initiative? It's over underneath your AC on your character sheet.

Right down right underneath you rolled above a five. What's he gonna say? Best roll tonight. Well, you have only rolled twice, sir. Oh, man.

Nobody's beaten out here. Oh, nice. Alright. We do, we do have, some hero points. That's true.

And you should spend them. Spend them because you got Could hear it good. I did it right good. 19 is pretty good. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You also did good. Okay.

But Samir and Alwar, you guys could use your hero points and reroll if you so desired. Yep. Not a bad idea. I think oh, I see what's happening. Pull up my character.

I see. Was displaced, and I actually logged myself out of everything. Yeah. I'll do that. I think I will.

This seems, relatively important. And my, we're all using a hero point. So to do that, just, hey. Write it down to hero point and then No. To to do that, you just need to go to the role that you wanna reroll, on on the chat window.

Right click on it, and then click on reroll, reroll using hero point. Sure. Why not? Oh, I got an anvil. We roll the 20.

Oh, my god. Hey. Wow. Yeah. That's a that's a good improvement, Seth.

That's critical. I I would have a brain. Well, yeah. But also, like, rolling a 20 in of itself is will increase the, will increase the degree of success by one. So, like, even if, like so if you roll a 20 and you failed, you automatically succeed.

If you roll a 20 and that was a success, then you could have succeeded. Critical succeed. Yeah. If you roll the 20 and it was still, and was a crit failure, you just failed instead of crit failed. So, rolling twenties are a very good thing.

Awesome. Very good. Rolling twenties is a good thing. Very good thing. Not bad.

Okay. So let's see. Where are we at here? We got we got okay. So our you know, you're kinda looking around and you do notice a few things specifically, like, in the in the windows of the temple, like, there's there appear to be some, larger holes, and and some and some shattered glass on the ground.

You didn't really notice them before. The sand was kinda covering covering things up. But as you look around on on the floor, they're definitely, like, pockmarks and scorch marks on the floor. Our no. Our it was the person that I just talked to.

Carsten. Yeah, Carsten, you see similar things, and you also see, like, on the actual glass itself, you do also see similar, like, scorch marks in in that in that kind of thing. So it it's appear it it appears that there there was some sort of, like, hailstorm, like really bad hailstorm that came through. It's basically effectively kinda what it looks like. Let's see here.

Here, you are able to see that, like, basically the the actual hourglass itself, they where whereas, our and Karsten were thinking maybe hailstorm, you're definitely seeing it's seeing that it's more of a, more of a metal, that it it's more of a, you suspect that this was this was the result of the flaming retribution, I guess, is the best way to put it. Like, basically, stuff it like, things came in here and, it looks similar to kind of, like, the meteors and and fire that was falling, that you saw as you were leaving the the blessed realm. You see you see similar examples here. So even this this temple was even not able to escape the flaming retribution is what you can tell. Sameer.

Inside what's that? I said Heidi ho. Heidi ho. Inside the actual hourglass itself, you see, you you see what is unmistakably a meteorite that has that has broken through the glass and is sitting, right in front of the, the entrance right here inside the, inside the, hourglass itself. The the meteorite appears to be made of a, a bright shiny silvery metal.

It still got it still got a lot of scorch scorch marks around it and it's kind of blackened, but even though it's blackened by the by the actual damage itself, it's still so it it it's still like the the inner glow of this metal is still kind of shining through. Alright. This might be nice. It could be something, wedged up in there at least. Yeah?

Yeah. Yeah. You would have to climb all up in there and grab it, but you definitely do see something in there. Perfect. I will commence the climb.

Alright. Still in there? Oh, boy. No. Not not really.

My my first question is looking at it, do I get the sense that, the meteorite is in any way, shape, or form, blocking the sand from coming out faster? Oh, like pulling a knife out of a wound? Yeah. Role crafting. Okay.

Double did it. You know what? We did it. That's nothing. Yeah.

I'm I'm happy with that. You are reasonably confident that it is that it is not going to be, making anything worse for you to pull that, for you to pull that meter right out. Okay. And what size is this thing that we're looking at here? About the size of a medium boulder.

Oh. Oh, okay. So about four foot by it it's about a four foot diameter boulder. Oh, okay. So it's something I can pick up pretty easy.

Except that can be picked up pretty easy. Something that you can pick up maybe. No. No. Okay.

Maybe Acrobatics. Stop. Check. With Carson. But the two of them can probably collectively okay.

So, I'll point it out and say, hey. Look at this. And I'll I'll kinda what I can scale that way. Okay. Go ahead and roll in athletics.

Crafting proficiency. Athletics or acrobatics, what did you say? Athletics. Alright. That's a little bit further off the ground, requires a little bit of climbing.

So Yeah. At least. We'll see how this goes. It's not horrible. It's not as good as I Yeah.

I mean, you're not, you know, you're you're you're by no means, like, unable to get up there. It just kinda takes a little bit longer than strictly you would have liked. Mhmm. But, yeah, you're able to make it in. So climb up there and I would make some snarky comment like, don't wizards just float up into there or something like that?

Because I watch you struggle. I'm not a wizard, so So sure. Look. Whatever you are. However, there are certain members of my ancestry who could probably just slide up here.

That'd be a lot easier. I haven't graduated. Are we trying to get this thing out? Yes. It's glowy metal.

Which Could be glowy goodness. It's a it's a bright silvery metal. Yes. We got it. I think we're gonna need to.

I'm not sure what this stuff is, but I think we need to get it out of here for sure. Need to examine it. Oh, let's just Alright. Well, you guys, you know, as you guys you eventually figure out, like, who who would be able to get who'd be able to get out of there the best. And so you're able to you're able to haul it out through a through a combined effort of Cahir and Karsten.

You're able to kind of be able you're able to kinda move it out. It definitely seems heavier than you thought it would be. And, so you're able to get you you are, yeah. So you you get it out. Upon inspection, anybody who's got crafting, go ahead and roll crafting to identify the, the metal.

Yay. Wait. Do I have to be trained in it? Yes. If I say if you've got it, you that means you have to be minimum trained.

Oh, baby. You got it. Oh. Wow. Oh.

Wow. Dice were hot. Nice. Good job to hear. I'm I'm rolling really well tonight.

I've had a seven and an eight and a 10. And a 20. And a 20. And a 20. On a reroll, that was a costly 20, but I got it.

Yeah. Alright. So to hear, you think you know exactly what this is. And, this is in fact a, a ball of star metal. Oh.

Oh. I see. A lot of star metal. Yeah. We might need a lot of star metal.

Because the only thing that you really need at this point, to be able to well, not the only thing that you need. But Mhmm. But but it it yes. Okay. So really quickly, looks like Scott's gonna take off in about nine minutes.

So I just wanna make sure that we're, that that we're in in a good spot. So, effectively, kind of what's gonna be happening over the next six months, is the, the the town itself is going to be kind of building building a scaffolding and and kind of like a way of getting up and down into the temple. They're also going to be paying a lot more close attention to their to their dad and where and where that's going. They are Jared has informed them to empower you guys to do whatever it is that you need to do in order to be able to find what you need to find in order to fix the problem. So those are those are kind of the the broad strokes of what's gonna be happening.

And this is again over the course of, like, six months. During that time, you guys can spend your time doing what what you already told me that you were going to be doing or if you have any additional things that you would like like to do, you can do that as well. You have star metal. You have everything that you need in order to patch this up at the moment, with the aid of the rest of the, rest of the group. If that is your desire to do, and I'm kinda rushing things.

I'm sorry about that. But I'm kinda trying to make sure that we get to a good play place before Scott's got a thaumimos Mhmm. Since we don't know when we're gonna be meeting next. So Right. So that's kinda that's kinda the lay of the land.

So you guys have all the materials that you need in order to be able to patch this thing, but it's not going to be but as you as you build it and put it together, you definitely know that this is it becomes more and more apparent that this is a temporary patch. So you are going to have to kind of try and figure out, a more permanent solution. But at the very least, you are at a place where you can, where you've bought yourself and your and the community a little bit more time. Excellent. So we can say we're patching it with that star metal then?

Mhmm. Yep. Yeah. Unless you want to make other things with the star metal and not patch it, you know. You you that is your right.

You can do that. Nope. And then we gotta go find the song first. Right? Right?

Also, just to if if you do go over to the map, you will notice that, there's a little bit more of the map that has been revealed over the over the course of the over the course of the six months that you guys are on. There there's, there there might be I might reveal a little bit more than this, but at the very least, like, at this point, the the town's scouts have gotten a little bit further out, and they've been able to they've been able to see more of the world around your town. Thus far, it's only been grass land that they found. There is, like, the edge of a forest in the South, that they have christened the burning the burned wood, primarily because the forest is a bunch of charred trees, And that's the direction that you guys generally came from. But as we have more, like, time leaps, I'm going to be revealing more and more of this map.

Or if you guys start traveling in a certain direction, then more of the map will be revealed in that specific direction. But that's basically kinda how I'm planning on revealing this is just, like, over time when we've got breaks, then, you know, the the scouts of the, of the of the village may get a little bit further out or maybe there are some survivors that come from somewhere else else and they talk about something and so it reveals a portion of the map elsewhere. But, as of right now, this is kinda where that is at the moment. Alright. Sounds great.

Mhmm. K. Cool. Sorry I didn't get any more, any more combat in this session, but, you know. Yes.

It was it was good. We've it was a very good it was a good it really was. I don't how much do I don't need combat every single time? This was good. Okay.

What are those buildings all over the map? Different towns? Those were the cities that existed prior to the We don't know if they still exist or not. We don't know if they exist or not. Yeah.

Right. Right. So if you go and try and travel to one of those one of those towns or cities, you may find that it still exists or you may find that it is, it it is a, no longer a blip on the map. So Nice. Sounds good.

Alright. Alright. We on level three, though? No. Well, I like that.

No. No. But, that does remind you though, you guys should get some XP for something. That's right. So I'm going to award the group, everybody.

Jason rolled it. I mean, that's where something right there is great. Yes. Experiential knowledge of 20. I'm not I'm not sure I wanna follow that logic.

Yeah. I'm going to award everybody a 120 XP for, finding a solution for the, for the, Days of our life. The glass. Hour glass. Yeah.

Yeah. Excellent. So Yay. Not much, but it's something. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. It's in the house. Yeah. Yeah.

We'll, and, next time we we pick up will be six months later. If this session changed any of your answers for kind of what you wanted to be doing, please do let me know. If not, then I'll just kinda run with what you had on top of, you know, just being more, on top of being being more, focused on repairing the, the hourglass as well. Mhmm. So it's gonna take you the better part of six months to be able to get everything kind of squared away as far as that's concerned, to be able to get that patch up and up and working.

If you've got any any additional things that you wanna research or look into, let me know, and then that should be should be it. Do we wanna try to meet on a Tuesday then? Was that the consensus in the future? I don't mind meeting on a Tuesday, but unless if there's a holiday, I can't meet until eight or 08:30. I I can try to do 08:00.

So whether we stop at ten Saturday nights that people wanna meet, like, later? I can't do Saturday nights. Sorry. You guys are so busy with your wives and kids. That's correct.

Time. Scott, you should be busy with your wives and kids. I mean, wife and kids. We we have wives. Oh, man.

Well, that would keep you busy. Oh, yes. That would. Yeah. It's hard enough to keep one around to keep one around.

It's hard enough to keep to to handle handle having one wife, let alone having more than one. Oh my gosh. And sometimes it's okay to take some time apart, like one Saturday a month. You know? Mhmm.

Oh, no. Mhmm. No. Anyways yeah. But no, we're I'll let her wait.

I'm yeah. I can I can generally do about I can generally do most anything? So, I mean, outside of certain certain certain thing certain weekends and that kind of stuff. I mean, if we had a Tuesdays or a Tuesday or Thursday night, we can generally do we can generally do one of those as long as it's not interrupting with Ramsey's game. But Alright.

Your game's on Tuesday nights, Randy? Thursday. Every other Thursday. Oh. But, yeah, we can totally do a a Tuesday night.

And even if it's even if it's just, like, you know, eight to ten or whatever, I mean, at least it's something. We'll just try and make sure that we're, hitting the ground running with those ones so we don't get, like, only half hour of playtime if we do it that way. But You can I mean, you can start at seven, and I'll just join and everyone do it? That works. When is, soccer season over?

Soccer season is over, Never. Last game is October 5? Over seventh, maybe? And then you're, and then you're picking up, coaching basketball after that? No.

I'm not really hopefully doing anything. You're picking up track and field after that one. No. It'll be it'll be his own soccer indoor soccer league. Nope.

I haven't played indoor soccer league since COVID. Oh, COVID killed it. It did. Oh, and it's like COVID. I had, just FYI, I had two people text me and said they got COVID over the weekend, and I kinda fell off my rocker.

Oh. Yep. I'm guessing that's what my kids have had for the last week and a half. Seriously? Two weeks.

Yeah. Yep. The doctors think that's what it is. All the tests came back negative, but they're like, the symptoms, the longevity of the cough, all that stuff. Yeah.

So we think it's good. Anyway. No big deal. Mhmm. Just highly annoying.

Yeah. Alright. Cool. Then I will talk to you later. Thanks, Chris.

Cool. Yep. Yeah. Thanks, guys. We'll, yeah, we'll catch you guys later, and we'll figure out the next time we meet.

So Yep. Sounds good. Yep. Sounds good. Bye.

See you. You there still, Chris? Okay.
