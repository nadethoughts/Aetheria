close enough. Okay, guys. So, when we last met, we had a situation where you guys had
just defeated some very elven-looking goblins and had entered into a cave. Upon entering the cave,
you noticed that the cave had no ceiling and it was a starry sky. You found yourself in some sort
of forest with a purple stream flowing to the right-hand side. In the distance, you saw a hut
that was surrounded by some vegetable patches and another animal pen. And you saw three women
surrounding a cauldron talking. You tried to sneak up, but they were alerted to your presence.
The woman, the old, old lady of the group that you know as Velcro, the main firewalker leader,
ran into the hut as you approached. The two other women, one, a young-looking, a young-pretty
woman and a green-hulking, for lack of a better term, hag, moved into defensive positions. One of them
disappeared around the corner of one of the vegetable patches and the other kind of knelt down close to a
fence. And the group advanced forward on these creatures.
And that is basically where we left it. Anything that I missed? And anything that anybody remembers
that I didn't, that I didn't include? I don't think so. That sounds about right.
All right. So let's get to it. Well, that is not what I was saying.
I'm expecting to see. Are you guys not able to see the map as well?
Yeah. I have not seen the map. It's a gray field.
Gray field. Yep. Super strange. I'm a bitch black.
Gray field. Yeah. Give me a second. I will find.
Okay.
Give me a second. I will find.
Okay.
Give me a second. I will find.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I think that said, if you need it updated, then just go ahead and refresh your screen, but it should be showing up here really shortly.
Yep.
Yep.
Okay.
Sorry about that.
I removed some modules because they were taking up a lot of space, apparently.
This needed it.
All right.
Cool.

Why I have the HUD that in this bottom center is because if you hover over any of these tokens,
because i figured it'd be nice for you to actually be able to kind of see what
see what they look like whenever you want to so you can just hover over and get a a picture
okay now the battle has um the battle is about to commence here um so okay here you
um you moved up to the corner duck behind a rock uh you do see the um the young woman
um and she sees you and it is her turn nice so she's she's gonna do a thing
so she's smart at the time
uh she's gonna target you and she's going to cast charm
she wants to be your friend
so okay here um i need you to make uh to uh on the on the right hand side of the thing make a save
um oh and let me just go ahead and make sure that we've got the
the hero points all situated here first um we are resetting everybody to one zero point piece so
um all right so you failed the charm check what that does is this targets this target's attitude
becomes friendly towards you so you become friendly towards um towards that young woman clearly she's
she's she's she's she doesn't know the kind of situation that she's that she's found herself in
and you're here to rescue her from um from those those evil those evil hag women
um she must be an innocent bystander um that's right i can't attack her
uh yeah so when this condition affects a creature uh your disposition to a particular character being her
um
and own uh it affects your disposition imposed condition to a pc a creature is friendly to the target likes the
character um friendly to the target um friendly to the target likes that character um so you like her
um it's likely uh
yeah so as long as she doesn't attack you um or do anything aggressive towards you
you think she's she must be she must be an innocent that's caught up in something
something nefarious so um that's that's basically what that means so uh you can't um you can't attack her
um from that perspective unless you would attack a friend so
so what does it mean when it says you can dismiss the spell if you use hostile actions against the
so so if she attacks you you are no longer chopped so
she casts the spell on you you're affected by it and as long as she doesn't attack you
you think she's she's an innocent even if she does attack um even if she does attack what your
your friends um um like even if she acts hostile towards the group but not you i think
yeah yeah i don't know she doesn't cut oh good
i was gonna say i don't know how the rules do it but to me it's always been like
you know you're not gonna kill your friend for attacking your other friend it's gonna be like
hey hey guys wake it up man we can talk about this
you know pretty much so as long as she doesn't attack you you don't you don't feel the need to attack her
so okay um um and then with that she's going to
back up a little bit hide behind a big toad
and
next up
is
visible hag
next up you will notice because she's going to no longer be invisible
why would she do that
she's can you see can you see the green hag
like a blob
it says something about being perfectly fine oh it's gone oh it's gone now okay okay i'll bring
it back all right i'm i was toggling the invisibility thing and it wasn't really showing to me which
it was so i was it couldn't couldn't figure out whether i think it's still under the invisible
condition but we can see yes yeah okay which probably explains why i'm having trouble here
so she's going to um she's going to cast something herself yeah she is oh i'm surprised
yeah shocking right
um so she's going to cast wall of thorns
oh i think i like it
oh five foot thick wall wow five foot thick wall
of brambles and thorns a straight line up to 60 feet long
so
let's do some
okay okay okay
all right all right now or how can you do on your term
that's what we can do
okay okay okay so there's this wall of thorns
and she will cast it
in the area that is that kahir is in
so
okay
so
here's
Oh, God.
Creatures, objects, or spells, the walls.
The wall stands vertically, if you wish.
The wall can get shoulder length, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Creatures, for every move action a creature uses to enter at least one of the wall spaces,
that creature takes 3D for piercing damage.
Each 10 foot by 10 foot section of the wall has immune to critical hits and precision damage to destroy.
Okay.
I'm not sure I understand the hardness 10.
Well, the hardness, that's, like, if you wanted to destroy it, you would have to, yeah,
you would have to overcome its hardness.
Or if you just want to move through it, you'll take some damage.
And it looks like she can't cast it in a place where somebody will take damage.
It has to be in front of them, it can't be through them.
It has to be, exactly.
So, we will go with that.
Okay.
So, you basically, Scott, there's that one really, really nice young lady.
And then you see, right as, right as this happens, you see, um, that ugly, um, that ugly ogre-like woman, um, appear in front of you.
And then a giant wall of brambles erupts in front of you.
Um, as she does some sort of magic, um, magic hand-waving.
Um, and that is her turn.
And then it is, then it's Vel'Kris turn, and she's going to do some stuff.
Oh, that's right.
Doing some stuff.
Oh, that's right.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right. That's right. That's right.
We have not even seen Vel'Kra, right?
You saw her, but she, you saw her run into the house.
you saw her run into the hut
into the hut
cool cool cool cool
alright
Karsten
you're up so you saw
you saw
the two women kind of take their
defensive positions you saw
one of them be
one of them create
a
one of them
cast a spell but you don't
know what it did and then you saw
the other one appear as it
created a giant
wall of brambles
in the only clear
path into the hut
area what do
you do
sorry
I cut out
and I didn't hear that
oh
so
you see that
so just
you see that white box
that's kind of like in the way there
yep
that's a wall of thorns
so
it's not something that you can't move
through yourself but you will take damage
if you do
and that is blocking your way
into the hut area
and that was
taken
that was
created by that
old green
humpback
lady
yep
right
can I just use my
super
light things on fire
and light that on fire
I mean
that does seem like it would catch fire
so
right
you probably could
you probably could use your flamethrower
yeah
I'm gonna use my flamethrower
and do
area of fire
I think
okay
that has a
that has a 15 foot
range on it
so you're gonna have to
you're gonna have to move up
to get there
but
oh boo
okay
uh
I can move up
he starts it on fire
will that
make it so it'll burn away
or that make it harder to pass through
uh
possibly burn away
I mean
it
it does have
it does have stats
to be
um
it's gonna let me free
free movement
there
I'll move right there
um
okay
um
so go ahead
and
roll your
uh
fire uh
fire breeze gauntlets
attack
I don't know
how do I do that
I just click on the
oh
oh
I clicked on them
do I have to highlight myself
so
what I'm gonna need you to do
is roll a
roll a strike
for that
um
okay
well actually
just roll damage
just roll damage
on your
internal breeze gauntlets
we'll
we'll just do that
I don't know how to
roll damage
that's what I'm saying
I don't know what button to push
am I putting a
fire area
or the strike
there's two different
which one do you want to use
either one
like
okay
you're gonna have to give me a minute
sorry
sure
yep
no problem
okay
I think this was addressed
a little while ago
and I
thought I heard the answer
but it's not
right
so
there's the
initiative
track
along the top
and then there's this
side
initiative
track
the bottom
left
can I get rid
of the one
on the
bottom
left
yes
if you go
into settings
you click on
configure settings
and scroll down
to
pf2e
hud
inside there
there's a
combat tracker
one
and there
should be
an enabled
checkbox
just
uncheck
that box
and then save it
you should be good
oh
okay
and it
it'll refresh
your screen
or
if it doesn't
you probably need
to refresh your screen
but it should remove it
it did something
oh
it looks like
it might be refreshing
now
okay
oh
six
a
fay
how
how
i don't know
how come
i'm so far
behind
because you
didn't move up
last time
like everybody
started there
but everybody
else moved up
and you
didn't move
at all
you just
cast a
i think you
cast a couple
spells
oh
if memory
serves
sounds
it has been
a minute
right
can i just say
i
i know
kihir
that
in your eyes
all the blood
on this
woman's
fingers
and dress
i'm gonna be
about 10 minutes
sorry
um
so
you wanna
play my guy
just play my guy
and kill whatever
you need to kill
you're right
but
she's still
ugly
that does not look
good
she's just a little
bleedy
just be
just because
the skin
is like
falling off
of her bones
that's
no reason
to
there's a
different allure
that she
shows me
than you
apparently
all right
well
we'll go ahead
and roll
i think i know
what clock's
gonna be doing
at this point
so he's
gonna be
right
he's
gonna be
doing
10 damage
to that
with the
fire
which is
not going
to be
enough
to destroy
that section
of wall
but
we'll just
have him
followed up
with a
just a
regular
strike
needs to have
a target
target
target
oh that's
tough
i'm gonna
have him
target
himself
oh
okay
okay
24 hit
an ac of
10
so he does
hit
14 more
points
damage
okay
so
karsten
karsten is
is able to
destroy part
of the wall
so
so
there's a
path
there's a
path that
opens up
right over
here
for people
to be able
to funnel
through
but that
took all
three of his
actions to
get there
samir you're
up
all right
um
you know
i uh
i probably
need to move
and i
would
okay
um
so we
have a
30 feet
is my move
yes
or is it
25
i believe
that you
i'm 30
yeah you're
at 30
because you're
an hour
a little bit
more zoomie
than your
average
duck
um
okay
yep
quacking
um
i would
uh
i'd like
to experiment
with this
fireball
thing
and seems
like a
great
idea
yeah
it does
doesn't it
yeah
real good
time
this should
be fun
it seems
like it
seems like
it might
it might
work out
yeah
pretty well
so let's
see what
you can
do
so targeting
this um
seems a
little bit
odd
because it's
a burst
um
so
i would
i'm not
sure that i
know where
this chick
is
here
um
yeah
i got a
pretty fair
idea
and yeah
you know
about where
they are
right
i'd kind
of like
to like
put the
put the
fireball
right there
i think
um
to try and
catch you
know a
decent section
of that
right
and and
with the
area effect
you know
the likelihood
is that i
would
probably
get close
do i need
to target
her
to do
that
rightly
no fireball
you just
target a
specific spot
and then
20 feet
20 feet
out
from that
individual
square
is
everything
everything
in that
damage
so um
really
uh if you
if you
cast fireball
it will
throw out
a message
in the chat
and it should
give you a
tempo that
you can
drop
oh
right
so
will it
hit me
too
possibly
just depends
on where
he places
it
so
in in
the chat
there's a
place 20
foot burst
button
if you
click that
and it'll
show you
oh that's
much bigger
than i
thought
okay
oh yeah
oh yeah
i thought you
we're going
to be blowing
everybody else
yes
yes it is
i thought it
was like a
20 foot
diameter
no
that's
no
that's
a lot
different
it's huge
huge
now that i
understand
yes
oh yeah
i'm pretty
happy with
that there
um with
the assumption
that the
if you
click it
it will
actually
yeah if
you click
it it'll
it'll just
land it
wherever so
we can see
so you've
got it so
it's actually
oh it might
burn down
some more
all the
wall too
well maybe
i don't know
how that works
but it did
its own thing
huh that's
neat
yeah that was
dope
yeah
uh so
now you just
want to
well you
want to
set targets
first
so um
there's a
little target
button there
so yep
so you
want to
uh you
see that
little target
button
yep
the check
mark target
button
yes
so if
you click
that
that
should
auto
target
yep
yep
it
auto
targets
them
perfect
and then
and then
i will roll
the npc
saves
and then
go ahead
and roll
damage
okay
well that would be pretty average
not not bad
not bad
at all
all right
so the green hag
takes
full damage
the blood hag
takes half
damage
and
the
poor wall
of thorns
is destroyed
oh we love
to see it
oh that's
nice
so
yeah
that's
that's pretty good
turn for you
that's
probably the best
turn i've had
all game
yeah
i mean
you're not
wrong
you you just
did like
uh
60
66 points
of damage
to
to you know
to everybody
so
that's pretty good
that's uh
that's a
yeah
yeah that is
um
it was nice to see
that i rolled
you know like
full damage
on a couple of dice
along with
the one
damage
you know
that i rolled
so
i mean like
balance
yeah
you got two
ones and two
sixes so
you know
that's still
good
all right
cool
um
and that's
your uh
third turn
right
that was
all three of
my actions
i do believe
all right
so
i'll worry
you're up
all right
sick
uh
fireball
is
will we
move
uh
i think i just
have 25
i don't see
why i would
have more
so step
one we
move
step
two
we
consider
our
options
35
60
i'm back
for now
hey
so
welcome
back
welcome
back
clark
you uh
karsten
basically
hacked a hole
into the
wall
um
which was
great
and then
samir
cast a
fireball
and just
blew
everything
to hell
so
that's
what you
missed
it was
pretty
pretty
dope
uh
step
two
i want
to
cast
a
spell
that's
good
that's
the best
i've
got
though
i don't
know
if it's
that
good
so
instead
i
i
oh
yeah
because
i
can
do
that
right
yeah
that
seems
good
uh
step
two
uh
i'm
going
to
vitality
transfer
a
point
of
vitality
to
uh
let's
go
the
point
of
vitality
to
karsten
he
looks
a little
further
out
from
things
uh
so
karsten
you're
going to
heal
one
and
more
importantly
you get
to
immediately
move
out of
turn
so you
can
take a
move
right
now
yay
my
normal
movement
yeah
your
normal
movement
yeah
25
uh
good
go to
her
so i
can
flank
her
i
can't
i
have
to
go
right
here
that's
25
i'll
go
right
here
why
did
it
do
that
nope
because
you
ran
into
a
wall
oh
well
i
don't
want
to
run
into
a
wall
oh
my
gosh
sorry
it
would
have
been
smoother
had
i
not
really
known
there
was
a
wall
there
okay
yeah
yeah
well
in
in
general
if
you
see
a
wall
in
this
map
then
there's
there's
a
wall
in
the
way
um
yeah
they're
actually
like
walls
on
this
map
and i
know
you
aren't
used
to
seeing
those
because
a lot
of
the
maps
that i
do
are
just
like
it's
a
picture
but
this
one
actually
has
a
wall
so
has
walls
did
my
character
automatically
heal
or do
i have
to
touch
something
uh
but did
not
automatically
yeah
you're
just
gonna
need
to
um
on
your
character
um
on your
character
sheet
just
increase
uh
78
to 79
okay
um
and
then
finally
for
three
we
will
uh
i
guess
we're
just
going
to
drop
into
strategist
stance
why not
that's
new
we've
not
done
that
yet
i
don't
think
uh
so
i
need
to
make
a
check
of
some
variety
uh
society
or warfare
war
so
bardic
lore
it
is
do
do
do
do
uh
skill
skill
skill
skill
skill
skill
bardic
lore
roll
this is
versus
a thing
of my
level
that's
probably
not
not
great
uh
standard
difficulty
dc
um
uh
dc
by level
where are
you
level
base
dc's
we are
level
five
uh
yeah
now
that's
that's
just
a fail
that is
just
a fail
uh
so
failure
i
failed
to
enter
the
stance
well
that
kind of
sucks
not worth
using a
hero point
on though
so that's
my turn
all right
that's what
i said
uh
i was gonna
or not
ramsey
sorry
chris
i was gonna
do this
and then
um
it got to
be my
turn
and i
totally
forgot
um
the well
spring
thing
yeah
yeah go
ahead and
go ahead
and roll
it
a d20
right
yeah
um
well
no
for
for your
wellspring
mage
where you
are right
now
i believe
that
you just
pick
one
now obviously
your
your threes
you didn't
have
but
um
but
no
no
no
no
um
up until
this point
we've had
you roll
a d6
so just
roll a d6
one to two
is level one
three to four
is level two
yep
and
four to six
is
what you get
all right
there you go
all right
scott
can you make
it rounder
forget
how to do
this
can you
can you
so i was
thinking
five
ten
fifteen
twenty
is diagonally
possible
or do you
have to go
up and then
over
diagonally is
possible but
every other diagonal
is going to be
count as
double movement
so your first
diagonal is a
five your second
diagonal is a
ten
so like if
you go two
diagonals in a
row that's
fifteen
fifteen
twenty
then five
fifteen
thirty
thirty
five
okay so i
can get to
there
is that
flanking her
no you
would need to
make one
more move
to get to
a flanking
position you
would need to
be here
okay
to flank
truly
opposite
size of
the character
right
we can't
flank her
no
fight and
swing
oh
uh
twenty-four
does still
hit
um
so
roll
damage
be
worth it
to try
to hit
her
or not
yet
hits a
hit
it's a
hit
because the
titan swing
i still get
extra die
die right
just
right
if you're
using
titan swing
yeah
you still
get an
extra die
so
clicked it
so hopefully
that worked
if you want
to use your
hero point
to try and
hit harder
you totally
can
i would
not
bother
with it
terrible
right
can
help
32 points
of damage
so
so yeah
you
you
have
you
hacker
with
your
with your
great
axe
which
gets
which
has
new
fire
elements
to it
because
of
your
your
artifact
it
like
your
your
axe
just
starts
to
blaze
with
fire
and
you
and
you
lob
off
like
her hump
back
and she
is in
real
real
real
pain
nice
also
kind of
gross
right
also
kind of
gross
a little
bit
oozy
a little
bit
oozy
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
now it
is
her
turn
again
a little
easier
and
more
because
you
you
you
you
you
you
you
you
you
you
um she is going to point her finger at Karsten and a mote of flame is going to
shoot out from her finger and she um and she positions the flame in such a way that it hits
like one of the hollow or one of the uh pieces of armor that's actually touching your skin
Karsten and it super heats the metal um causing immense pain and you take 24 points of fire
damage okay any type of save uh no save it's just she she attacked she critted you uh you
take damage oh wow oh sorry i i applied it to you so i removed it you're good you're not
like double 24 um and then she's going to move
let's see let's move in speed okay i'm just gonna move here
she's going to attempt to grab you that's less than excellent
i guess she's going to claw you because that is how she grabs people so she's gonna
really and she will hit
dealing
15 more points of damage oh wait wait wait wait wait i did that wrong
wait um her claw attack is with the multiple attack penalty need to make sure that make sure
that we use the second one and she crit misses so that's fine so i guess she doesn't do anything
yeah it's fine
all right so green hag is kind of found herself in pickle
um she is going to target
okay here
and
chris before you do anything can i ask a dumb question probably i have this thing reaction
called nimbus surge i really don't know what it means
sounds like if somebody's moving or manipulating something that's within reach i can do a reaction
but i don't know what that means
i've never had a reaction thing
yeah step away from there i'm back
okay
i think i'm back
can you guys hear me
yep
yep yep we can hear you
i can hear you
okay okay okay good um so the hag is going to target uh here and she is going to strike him
um so she lifts out her her fingers which have these huge like talon like claws at the end of them
and she just kind of like digs india
um
dealing eight points of damage to you
um
but i also need a
dc i also need you to make a fortitude save please
did you did you hear my question earlier about the nimbus surge
oh
no i did not
okay
i don't think it applies but it says a creature within your reach uses a manipulate action or a move action
makes a range attack or leaves her square
during a move
and that creates an ability for me to do something
something but i don't really know it is
okay uh yeah so
if she casts a spell
then that's using a manipulate action
if she moves out
from your uh
moves away from you then that's
um
that's
okay
how how that works
so
um
active
yeah
yeah and i think the nimbus surge is basically an attack of opportunity
uh reactive strike
so if she moves outside of your
uh range you get a
whacker
okay
memory serves
okay so you succeeded
on the
on the uh attack
so you are not enfeebled
um
and then when she
uh
and then as she uh
after she claws you
she
um
exhales
um
and this
noxious
fumes
come
come out of her
out of her mouth
mouth
um
and it just kind of overwhelms you for a little bit
for a bit
um
okay um
and for that i'm gonna need another
fortitude save
that you're probably gonna pass
that you're probably gonna pass
pretty good rule
so
um
all right well
there's a little bit of a little bit of a mismatch there
um
um
and
again
uh
so
you
To do
Does some styles
I see her
You don't see
And you don't see nothing
Nothing to see here folks
Move along
Scott what do you want me to do
Do you want me to kill the
Try to kill the hag
I think I can kill her
You should probably focus on the white witch
White witch
Okay I'm going to whack her
Alright
Come at her bro
Is there anything special I need to do
You've got your
Yeah you're doing your double slice right
Yeah
There we go
Wait
There
Oh my gosh
Okay so you hit with one
You hit with the shield spike
Yeah you missed what the winner's done
But you hit with the shield spike
Yeah I don't
I want to re-roll that
What
I want to hit
Okay re-roll your
Re-roll your attack with winner's done
The cool thing is
It was 8.59 when he said that
So he'll get another
Nine o'clock here point anyway
That's right now
If you
If you go to
The attack that missed
Right click on the
On the
Chat window
There should be a
Re-roll with hero point option
Oh there we go
Nine
Plus ten
Did I do it
Yep
Yeah
You crit with that one
Feels critical
Feels critical
Nice
Ooh
Ooh
Pretty good damage there
That's pretty good
Don't forget to roll your
Did you
Roll the critical
Or did you
Roll the regular
There
That's not bad
Mm-mm
Did that take up
Two
Two hits
Right
That's two actions
So you have one more
Action left
Yeah
I'm just gonna
Whack her for the
Last time
Okay
And
With that one
You have to apply
The
Third
Multiple attack
Penalty
Attack
On that
Yep
So
Oh
What the
Hap
Oh
It's right on
Nineteen
All right
Well you miss
You
You swing wildly
With your third
Attack
But your first
Two ring
Hit pretty
Hit pretty
True
Um
Samir
You're up
Uh
Gosh
Yeah
Um
Still
Still
Oh
What's the matter
Buddy
And I think
That's the best
I can do
For a move
There's a nice
Nice 30 feet
We're
We're closing
In on it
Um
Um
I
Think
It looks like
I'm targeting
Both the enemies
Still
Um
How do I
Untarget
Them
Um
I think that
If you just
Hover over
One of them
And press
T
It will target
That one
And ignore
The other
Okay
Uh
I kind of
Did the opposite
All right
Um
I think I'm gonna
Try that
That good
The T works
I do like
The T idea
Um
It's the only
Way I get
To target
People
You have to
Hover
And press
T
You guys
Get double
Click
Lucky
I think
I'm gonna
Try this
Um
At what
Point
Do these
Any of these
Spells
Get heightened
Um
So as a
Spontaneous
Caster
You have to
Learn a spell
At a higher
Rank
In order to
Be able to
Heighten them
Unless that
Spell is one
Of your
Signature spells
Um
And for
Sorcerer
I believe
That that
Is your
Um
Those are
Bloodline
Spells
On your
Signature
Spells
So
You
Like if you
Want to
Get something
Heightened
You'd have to
Relearn it
At a higher
Level
It would be
The exact
Same
Spell name
Correct
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Okay
Um
I'm gonna
Do
A little
Bit
Of
Gosh
That's just
Not much
Oh
It was
Oh
Yeah
Well
That's not
Yeah
That's not
The one
I was
Looking at
Looking at
This
One
I guess
We'll
Do
This
One
I think
I've got
The chick
Targeted
Correct
Green
Check
The green
The green
Heck
Yeah
I have her
Targeted
So
She gets
A reflex
Save
Please fail
That'd be
Great
Okay
Let's
Let's
See
What we
Got
Here
She
Did
Succeed
So
That would
Be
Half
Damage
Then
Half
Damage
Yeah
So
She'll
Take
Eight
Points
Yeah
She'll
Take
Seven
Points
Of
Damage
From
Your
Thunder
Strike
I
Think
That is
That's
All
My
Actions
Okay
Alright
So
You
Cast
A
Loud
Thunder
Crack
Which
As
You
Know
As
She's
Kind
Of
Trying
To
Do
Her
Best
To
Defend
Herself
Kahira
You
Probably
See
This
The
Most
Like
She
Just
Jumps
In
In
Fear
And
Pain
As
She
Gets
Hammered
By
Some
Clap
Of
Thunder
That
Came
Out
Of
Nowhere
Our
Right
Well
Looks
Looks
Like
I
Need
To
Say
The
Words
Again
So
That's
Step
One
I
Have
No
Focus
Points
Really
Doesn't
Seem
Right
That
Doesn't
Seem
Right
Either
I
Definitely
Used
One
This
Combat
That
But
I've
Definitely
Not
Used
Two
And
I
Know
We
Rested
Right
Before
Because
Heal
Rest
Yeah
So
I
Think
I
Should
Have
One
Left
Yeah
I
Would
Agree
So
Yeah
Okay
All right
Cool
Well
We're
Going to
Do
That
Greatest
Anthem
Go
All
Right
Do
Do
Do
And
Roll
Well
It's
Not
A
Great
Roll
Oh
Still
Last
Three
Rounds
We'll
Take
It
All
Right
So
That
Was
Step
One
I
Don't
See
Anybody
Else
So
Yeah
I
Guess
I
Just
I
Just
Do
The
Thing
I
Don't
Oh
If
It's
Worth
Probably
Is
Right
How
Close
Are
We
35
Yeah
35
All right
Well
Not
Casting
Those
Spells
I
Guess
I
Can
Move
Closer
And
I
Think
That's
Just
Gonna
Have
To
Be
What
We
Do
When I
Can
Now
Oh
I'll
Do
The
Thing
I
Just
Need
To
Target
These
Stupid
Things
Target
Two
Oh
I
Know
What
Happens
I
Was
Still
On
The
Measure
Oh
Okay
That's
Like
And
I'm
Going
To
Slashing
Go
Them
It's
Just
Standard
Attack
I
Guess
Oh
Hmm
Hmm
Interesting
Interesting
Interesting
Interesting
Interesting
Interesting
Reroll
With
Hero
Point
Where
Is
That
Option
Hmm
Hmm
I
See
Reroll
Keep
The
Higher
Do I
Not
Have
A
Hero
Point
Did
I
Didn't
Think
You
Used
One
Tonight
Well
We're
Right
Around
That
Time
For
Everybody
To
Get
Another
Hero
Point
Sweet
Reroll
Using
Hero
Point
I
Do
Not
Use
The
Oh
That's
Much
Better
That
Is
A
Boat
Load
Better
That
Is
Way
Way
Better
18
Plus
10
Nice
Job
Really
Whatever
Okay
Okay
So
That
Hits
I
Guess
Roll
Damage
Uh
Huh
30
Is
What
That
It
Was
18
Plus
10
Puts
Us
At
20
That
Should
Be
40
Right
Or
Is
It
Not
Plus
12
You
Didn't
Roll
Low
To
Get
The
Plus
10
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
You
Only
Get
The
Plus
10
If
It's
10
Or
Less
Oh
Really
Yeah
I
Didn't
Know
That
Yeah
So
With
The
Hero
Point
You're
Always
Guaranteed
To
Get
The
10
Or
11
You're
Always
Guaranteed
To
Get
11
Or
More
So
Or
10
Or
More
All
All
Right
That
Will
Be
My
Turn
Then
All
Check out
The
Injured
One
Here
You're
Free
To
Go
Kill
That
Other
One
Yeah
I
Just
Never
Roll
Oh
You
Can't
No
He
Can't
I
Was
I
Was
Hitting
The
One
In
Front
Of
Me
Yeah
Yeah
I
For
But
She
Was
Yeah
I
Just
Thought
Yeah
Lower
Hit
Points
Get
So
Okay
Here
Or
Scott
You
Have
An
Option
Here
That
You
Could
Probably
Employ
Which
In
This
In
This
Example
I
Think
It's
Probably
A
Good
Idea
You
Can
Remove
Yourself
From
Initiative
So
Just
Choose
Not
To
Take
A
Turn
And
Then
Wait
For
Something
That
You
Can
React
To
To
Happen
And
Then
Insert
Yourself
Back
In
Initiative
At
That
Point
So
That
Way
Wasting
Your turn
Yeah
Right
So
If
I'm
The
Last
Person
In
The
Round
I
Didn't
Think
I
Could
Do
That
No
You
You
Are
You
Can
Hold
Your
Turn
Indefinitely
So
I
Can
I
Can
Still
Be
Behind
Elwer
Right
Right
So
Well
You
Can
Do
One
Of
Two
Ways
Like
You
Can
Hold
Your
Turn
And
Then
If
Something
Happens
Like
Say
Velcro
Appears
For
Example
It
Gives
You
Somebody
To
Target
You
Can
Immediately
Like
After
Her
Turn
Insert
Yourself
Into
That
Initiative
And
Then
You
Be
Able
To
Take
Your
Turn
At
That
Point
So
In
A
Way
You're
Losing
A
Turn
But
Also
You're
Able
To
Insert
Yourself
At
The
Right
Moment
So
The
Moment
That
She
Appears
You
Can
Run
In
And
Attack
So
Rather
Than
Having
To
Wait
For
Everybody
Else
To
Take
Another
Turn
Before
You
Take
Your
Next
Action
Right
But
I
Can
Only
Go
Once
Next
Round
Is
What
You're
Saying
Still
Right
Right
But
You'd
Be
In
A
Better
Spot
In
Initials
So
I
Mean
It's
Yeah
I
Could
Just
Run
Away
Because
I
Can
See
Velcro
Is
So
Close
To
Me
I
Could
Just
Run
Away
Just
Kidding
You
Could
Just
You
You
Have
We
Had
A
Rough
Idea
That
She
Went
Into
The
Hut
You
Could
Take
Movement
In
That
Direction
Yeah
Yeah
If
You
Wanted
To
Move
On
The
Map
She
Is
25
Feet
From
Me
Well
You
You
Actually
Can't
See
Her
She
In
The
She
In
The
In
The
Thing
Um
But
Yeah
Yeah
She's
She's
In
The
Stable
Um
And
She
Like
Went
Into
The
Stable
Via
A
Back
Route
So
Um
No
That's
Fine
I'm
Trying
To
Just
Pass
Okay
Um
Well
Actually
You
Know
What
Scott
Roll
A
Perception
No
No
I'm
Not
Making
Easy
On
You
There's
A
There's
A
Legitimate
Chance
That
You
Might
Have
Noticed
Movement
In
The
Stables
Because
You're
So
Close
So
Just
Roll
Me
A
Roll
Perception
And
If
You
Get
A
If
You
Get
A
15
Oh
No
No
Worse
Just
Trying
To
Click
On
My
Character
If
You
Get
A
15
Or
Above
Okay
So
You
Notice
That
There's
Movement
In
The
Stables
So
You
Can
Choose
To
Either
Ready
In
Action
For
If
Something
Happens
In
Which
Case
You
Wouldn't
Like
Like
Ready
In
Action
Costs
Two
Actions
To
Do
But
You
Could
Basically
Like
Move
Towards
The
Stable
And
Then
Ready
In
Action
To
Attack
Anything
That
Comes
Out
Of
There
If
You
Wanted
To
Or
You
Could
You
Know
Move
Towards
The
Stable
And
Like
Charge
In
See
You
Find
Something
To
Attack
In
There
Or
You
Can
Just
Hold
On
To
Your
You
Can
Just
Skip
Your
Run
If
You
Want
To
That
Way
To
Still
Think
That
Holding
Your
Action
Would
Be
A
Really
Good
Route
Even
Even
If
You
Don't
Want
To
Ready
In
Action
For
Attacking
Anything
In
The
Stable
Just
Because
You
Would
Actually
Be
Able
To
Take
Action
Soon
That
Just
Me
Yep
Okay
So
What's
Your
Decisions
I'll
Just
Pass
Okay
Alright
So
Moving
On
It
Is
The
Blood
Hag
She
Is
Going
To
Continue
Her
Onslaught
On
Karsten
So
She's
Going
To
Try
And
Claw
Him
Which
Will
Hit
For
17
Points
Of
Damage
And
She's
Going
To
Successful
Strike
So
She's
Going
Use
An
Action
To
Grab
You
So
You
Are
Now
Grappled
And
Then
She's
Going
To
Open
Her
Mouth
And
You
See
Fangs
In
In
Her
Mouth
And
She
Latches
On
To
You
And
Starts
To
Drain
Your
Blood
Or
At
Least
Tries
To
Do
So
I'm
Going
To
Need
A
Athletics
Check
From
You
Um
She's
Probably
Can
Fail
So
She
Tries
To
Overpower
You
And
Start
Draining
Your
Blood
But
Is
Unable
To
Do
So
As
You
Fend
Her
Off
Good
I'm
I'm
Kind of
Hurting
Thanks
Yes
Yes
You
Are
You
Are
In
A
World
Of
Pain
Right
Now
So
Velcro
Is
Going
To
Move
Out
She's
Going
To
Come
Out
Of
The
Stable
And
When
She
Does
She's
Going
To
Be
Calling
To
Something
Behind
Her
Excellent
Doing
What
She's
Going
To
Be
Calling
To
Something
Behind
Her
And
Then
She
Is
Going
To
Cast
Cast
Then
She's
Going
To
Target
Kahir
And
She's
Going
To
Cast
Magic
Missile
She's
Going
To
Do
A
Two
Action
Magic
Missile
Which
Is
Two
Missiles
And
Magic
Missile
Always
Hits
Scott
So
You
Just
Take
Damage
And
You
Take
Six
Points
Of
Damage
From
Her
Magic
Missiles
Scott do
You
Want
To
Insert
Yourself
Into
Initiative
At
This
Point
Or
You
Just
Wait
You're
Still
Muted
How
Did I
Get
Muted
I
Don't
Care
I'm
Happy
To
Wait
You
Can
Do
Okay
Well
The
Thing
Behind
Her
Runs
Out
Oh
Dear
That
Is
A
Thing
What
You
See
Is
A
Skeletal
Horse
That
Is
Looks
Like
It's
The
In
It's
In
It's
In
Trails
Are
Like
Lava
Or
Fire
Filled
There's
Some
Sort
Of
Red
Energy
Filled
It's
It
Runs
Out
Screeching
And
Moves
Into
Moves
Into
Start
Some
Start
Some
Havoc
Here
It
Is
Going
To
Flaming
Gallop
Like
It
So
It's
Going
Go
Here
Here
Here
Here
You
Get
To
Use
Reactive
Strike
Boom
Here
Here
Here
Here
Flaming
Gallop
Heat
It
Moves
Up
To
Triple
Its
Speed
Its
Whoves
Burst
With
Intense
Flame
Dealing
3d6
Fire
Damage
With
A
DC
24
Base
Deflect
Save
To
Each
Creature
Other
Than
The
Nightmare
Other
Than
The
Nightmare's
Rider
Adjacent
To
During
Any
Creature
Other
Than
Nightmare's
Rider
That
The
Nightmare
Moves
Adjacent
To
During
This
Gallop
Each
Creature
Can
Be
Effected
Only
Once
During
The
Single
Use
Of
The
Falling
Gallop
So
I'm
Going
To
Need
Carson
Hour
And
Some
Year
I'm
Going
To
Just
Reflect
Yep
Oh
That's
Pretty
Good
Um
Oh
My
Gosh
I'm
Gonna
Do
An
Eerie
Flicker
Chris
It
Did
It
Did
Trigger
A
Reactive
Strike
Okay
I
Don't
Do I
Click
On
The
Beast
I
Don't
Know
What
To
Do
With
That
Yeah
So
Just
Just
Target
The
Target
The
Nightmare
And
Roll
Roll
Roll
A
Hit
A
Normal
Hit
Right
So
Eerie
Flicker
Does
That
Do
Anything
For
Reflex
Save
Things
Oh
Is
That
What
This
Is
A
Reflex
Um
Yeah
This
Is
Save
I
Don't
Know
Um
Is
So
Regardless
It's
For
An
Attack
That
Didn't
Cause
Damage
So
Um
Is
I
Supposed
To
Do
A
Reflex
Save
Cause
I
Didn't
Hear
My
Name
Yeah
Everybody
Does
A
Reflex
Save
Okay
We're
Looking
For
A
DC
24
Oh
Nice
So
Anybody
Who
Okay
So
Anybody
Who
Stayed
The
24
Um
Takes
Seven
Points
Of
Damage
Anybody
Who
Did
Make
It
Takes
Three
Points
Damage
Go
Manually
Do
That
Um
Yeah
I
Think
You're
Going to
Manually
Do
That
Okay
Yeah
Yeah
And
I
Yeah
This
Is
Fine
Okay
Karsten
You're
Up
So
You just
Got
Trampled
Um
You've
Got
This
You've
Got
This
Uh
Lady
That
Appears
To
Have
Her
Skin
Fallen
Off
Hanging
Out
With
You
What
Are
You
Going
To
Whacker
Damn it
Hmm
Oh
Nice
Nice
Looks
Like
Two
Hits
What
Do
I
Do
For
Damage
Just
Hit
Damage
Right
Yep
Wherever
You
See
The
Target
With
The
Arrow
On
It
In
The
Damage
Are
Just
Click
On
Those
That's
That's
Your
Correct
Damage
Still
Not
Dead
Holy
Cow
Oh
No
You
You
Are
Currently
In
A
Boss
Battle
Sir
That
Means
That
These
Guys
Are
Tough
Yeah
I guess
So
I
Will
Probably
End
Up
Dying
Maybe
Well
Nobody
Else
Has
Actually
Taken
A
Hit
So
You
Just
Happen
To
Be
The
The
Target
And
There
Are
Plenty
Of
People
That
Have
Healing
All
These
Here
So
I
Don't
Think
That
You're
Dead
Just
Yet
But
Maybe
Not
Yet
If
People
Decide
They
Don't
Want
To
Heal
You
Then
You
Might
Have
Trouble
Right
Here
I
Be
Yeah
You
Can
Just
Be
Strong
I
Hit
Oh
You're
Using
Your
Final
Attack
Yep
No
You
Miss
How
Do
You
Know
I
Can't
Tell
Because
I'm
Looking
At
Their
Armor
Class
And
I'm
Looking
At
Your
Hit
I
I
Oh
You
Have
To
Say
It
Doesn't
Really
Say
It
On
The
Thing
Okay
Yeah
No
It
Won't
Say
It
On
On
The
Thing
Okay
I'm
Pretty
Sure
That
Like
I
Have
Information
That
You
Don't
So
But
Yeah
20
Does
Not
Hit
No
All
Right
Samir
You're
Up
I
Thought
I
Thought
I
Had
Another
Thing
And
I
Do
Definitively
Not
Um
No
Anyway
Um
Too much
Of
Me
Here
All
Right
Can't
See
There
Well
Um
We'll
Play
With
This
Horsey
Thing
For
A
Minute
Here
We'll
Do
One
Of
These
It's
Pretty
Weak
But
Could
Be
Fun
So
You
Oh
Something
That
You
Should
Note
About
The
Nightmare
You
Especially
Know
The
Samir
This
Doesn't
Affect
Anything
That
You're
Currently
Doing
But
These
Nightmare
Is
Surrounded
By
The
Horse
Is
Surrounded
By
Some
Dark
Fog
That
Makes
It
Harder
To
Harder
To
See
See
Yeah
But
Yeah
Um
It
Did
Pass
The
It
Did
Pass
The
Fortitude
Save
That
Kind
Of
Sucks
Um
What
Was
The
Thought
Oh
Um
Does
The
Sorcerous
Potency
Add
I mean
Like
What
Is
That
Doing
To
This
Thing
Does
That
Do
Anything
To
It
Or
No
Potency
Having
A
Hard
Time
Well
It's
Because
It's
Not
In
The
Spells
This
Magical
Power
Is
Inherited
By
Your
Blood
Your
Spells
That
Hurt
Or
Cure
Are
Stronger
Than
Those
Of
Other
Spell
Casters
When
You
Cast
A
Spell
From
Your
Spell
Slots
That
Either
Deals
Damage
Or
Stores
Hit
Points
You
Gain
A
Status
Bonus
That
Spell
Damage
Or
Healing
Equal
To
The
Spell's
Rank
This
Supplies
Only
On
The
Initial
Damage
Or
Healing
Of
The
Spell
Okay
So
Because
It's a
Cantrip
Probably
Doesn't
Affect
Anything
Right
It's
Spell's
Rank
Is
Zero
Right
That's
Not
Bad
Damage
Um
So
Yeah
It
Still
Takes
Six
Points
Of
Damage
Which
Is
Not
Yeah
It's
Not
Bad
For
The
Little
Spell
That
It
Was
Yeah
Um
For
A
Cantrip
That
Is
Definitely
Bad
Um
The
Rocks
Are
Walls
Yes
Right
As are
The
Scrolling
Crossbones
I'm
Assuming
Um
I
Think
That
You'll
Be
Able
To
Get
Through
Those
Um
But
I
Think
That
The
Wall
The
Just
Check
Uh
Well
The
Rocks
Don't
Actually
Count
Bad
Walls
But
They
Would
Be
Difficult
Turning
Oh
Okay
Okay
So
You
Move
Up
Okay
That's
All I
Have
Okay
Well
We've
Got
Some
Decisions
To
Make
Right
Uh
First
And
You're
At
30
Chris
The
Um
The
Cold
Doesn't
Adversely
Affect
That
Creature
Um
Not
That
You
Not
That
You
Not
Okay
Sounds
Good
Yep
Okay
Um
What
Do
We
Do
We're
Just
Out
Of
Freaking
Position
Um
Second
Second
Ring
Okay
Okay
Okay
Okay
That's
What
It
Does

How much
Damage
Was
That
Thing
Doing
To
You
Clark
Uh
On
On
On
Average
It's
Doing
13
Or
On
Average
It's
Doing
17
Points
Damage
A
Hit
Um
But
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
And it
And it
Is
Very
Consistently
Hitting
Like
When it
Rolls
Back
It's
Hitting
Alright
Well
Here's
What we're
Going to
Do
We're
Going to
Move
Up
To
Like
Uh
No
Actually
Not
There
We'll
See
From
There
Up
To
Light
Oh
I'm
On
My
Measuring
Tool
Again
I'm
Like
Why
Aren't
I
Moving
I
Think
Here
That
Was
15
Yeah
Yeah
We're
Going to
Move
Up
To
Here
Um
And
Then
We
Will
Cast
A
Second
Level
Soothe
On
To
Karsten
And
Hopefully
Roll
Roll
Pretty
Well
That
Could
Be
Worse
And
You
Should
Have
A
Button
Over
There
Karsten
To
Take
That
Healing
Somehow
Karsten
You
Do
Also
Have
Lay
On
Hands
That
You
Can
Cast
On
Yourself
As
Well
I
Do
I
Just
Didn't
Want
To
Really
Spend
My
Time
Doing
It
But
I
May
Have
To
Yeah
I
Mean
Yeah
You
Might
Not
Have
A
Choice
Here
Plus
It
Does
Actually
Give
You
An
EC
Bonus
When
You
Use
It
In
Combat
Which
Could
Be
Helpful
Yeah
It
Probably
No
He's
Been
Hitting
Me
Way
Higher
Yeah
But
Also
Keep
In
Mind
That
Hitting
Is
There's
A
Very
Big
Difference
Between
Hitting
And
Critting
So
Even
If
She
Can
Keep
Hitting
You
If
You
Make
It
Harder
For
To
Crit
You
She
Won't
Drop
You
So
Just
Because
She's
Still
Going
To
Be
Hitting
You
Doesn't
Doesn't
Mean
That
An
AC
Bonus
Isn't
Valuable
It
Could
Prevent
You
From
Being
Critted
On
Which
Is
Pretty
Huge
In
This
Game
So
Not
That
I'm
Saying
You
Have
To
Lay
On
Hats
But
I'm
Just
Saying
It
It
Is
A
Pretty
Viable
Option
So
All
Right
Al
Where
Is
That
That
That's
Me
I
I
I
Hear
You're
Up
We
Just
Pass
My
Turn
Again
Why
Are
You
Passing
Your
Turn
Just
Kidding
I
Want
To
See
What
This
Lady
Looks
Like
Looks
Like
Your
Mama
Is
It
Worth
Titan
Striking
Her
Or
Just
Trying
To
Hit
Her
Twice
I
Can
Strike
Her
Like
Kick
Her
Buck
If
You
It
Depends
I
Mean
You're
Going
To
Do
More
Damage
If
You
Hit
Her
Twice
But
You're
Going
To
Be
More
Like
To
Hit
On
Book
On
Just
Doing
One
Attack
With
An
Extra
Dive
Damage
So
Right
It's
A
Trade
Off
Either
Way
Okay
Let's
Titan
Swing
Titan
Swing
Miss
What
Use
Your
Thingy
Sounds
Like
A
Hero
Point
To
Me
Yep
What'd
You
Roll
Hit
Hit
He
Rolled
11
And
He
Missed
This
One
Hit
This
One
Did
Hit
Yeah
The
29
Hits
The
26
Does
Not
For
Those
Of
You
Keeping
Track
At
Home
That's
Pain
Full
Big
Money
Big
Money
Not
Very
Poor
At
Awesome
Persistent
That's
Pretty
Barely
Hurt
Though
She
Is
The
Big
Baddy
The
Big
Baddy
Yeah
All
Right
So
You
Run
Up
And
You
Ask
Her
A
Question
You
Ask
Her
A
Really
Good
Question
Yeah
You
Ask
She
She
She
She
Replies
With
No
Thank
You
You
Are
A
Sterling
Young
Man
Is
What
She
Says
All
Right
So
Moving
On
The
Blood
Hag
Is
Actually
Going
To
Use
An
Ability
She's
Going
To
Use
Her
Fiery
Form
Entire
Action
Don't
Like
That
Removes
Her
Burled
Skin
Excellent
Yep
So
She
Whips
Off
That
Skin
That's
Been
Hanging
Off
Her
Almost
She
Becomes
Anamorphosis
Gains
The
Trait
And
Gains
The
Fire
Trait
And
The
Fly
Speed
Of
60
Feet
Becomes
Immune
To
Fire
And
Emits
Light
As
If
A
Torch
She
Loses
Her
Melee
Strike
And
Can't
Drain
Blood
But
She
Deals
3d
10
Fire
Damage
Um
With
A
DC
26
Basic
Reflex
Save
To
Each
Jermot
Touch
Her
You
Are
Not
Immune
To
Fire
Damage
You
Are
Resistant
To
It
I
Think
Nope
Electricity
If
Her
Skin
Is
Intact
She
Can
Return
To
It
That
Doesn't
Matter
At
This
Point
The
Hag
Can
Instead
Assume
Fire
Reform
As
A
Simple
Action
Bursting
Through
Her
Skin
In
A
Blast
Of
Flames
Doing
So
Destroys
Her
Barled
Skin
Deals
9
D6
Fire
Damage
In
A
20
Foot
In
A
Nation
And
That's
What
She's
Going
To
Do
So
Is
Her
Spell
Broken
Off
Of
Me
Yeah
It
Will
Be
At
This
Point
Because
You
Are
You
Are
One
Of
The
People
Who
Is
Targeted
By
The
Basic
Reflex
Save
So
I
Need
Reflex
Save
From
Our
I
Need
One
From
Carson
I
Need
One
From
Cahir
What
Do
You
Need
A
Reflex
Save
Oh
Man
That
Was
Looking
Really
Good
There
Looking
For
26
Oh
Yeah
I'm
Going
To
Get
That
One
So
Me
Two
Eighth
Reflex
Reflex
Reflex
Reflex
It's on
The chat
Running
Man
All right
Great job
Not all
Ones
Dang it
So
Cahir
And
Carson
You
Both
Take
28
Points
Of
Damage
I'll
Worry
You
Take
14
All
Right
Manually
I'll
Just
Go
Ahead
And
Do
It
Okay
Even
Better
I
Mean
I
Just
Did
A
Buck
Ton
Of
Damage
To
You
So
I
Don't
Want
To
For
She
To
Do
Damage
That
Just
Mean
All
Right
So
She
Bursts
Out
Of
Her
Skin
And
And
And
Do
Do
Do
She's going to move.
You still got actions left?
Yeah.
I thought that was her whole
everything.
No, she
can basically burst out of her skin
as a single action, and that's what
causes all that damage.
So she basically
incinerates her skin.
Okay.
How do you know when it's a three
action thing? Because that one
says there's three up there, but
she only has to use one of them.
It's in
the text in there. It says the hag
can instead assume a fiery form
as a single action,
bursting through her skin in the
blast of flames.
Doing so destroys the
borrowed skin and deals
the damage.
That's
how I got it.
It's just
in. It just says
so it just
just says it's
it just says
it's
it is going to
I get to use a reactionary
strike.
Yeah, you do.
Oh, another one.
Except she's not there.
Down here.
I see her.
I see her.
Oh my gosh.
Did I hit?
Uh, yes, you do hit.
Only just.
So, her AC is
officially 26, so
everybody knows.
another 17.
That's ridiculous.
And she doesn't have
any physical attack,
so why don't you leave
them halfway to
hanging out with you?
She just got spells now.
She can stay there.
That's, that's
fine.
Oh, no.
That's fine.
She is going to
firebolt you, though.
She's going to what?
Firebolt you.
Huh.
Firebolt who?
She does hit you.
Do you want to
do your
airy flicker?
I click the
yes button.
Okay.
So, we'll go ahead
and mark you.
Uh, go ahead and
roll a, what is it?
A d20.
If you roll under a
five, you, she misses.
Oh, I roll that.
That is just what
you needed to hit, so
she, her firebolt
just flies straight
through you.
Straight through.
Oh, that's
beautiful.
That actually
worked this time.
It does work
on occasion.
Yeah.
All right.
Um.
Now.
Delcra.
Oh, what?
Are there
uh, straight
misses?
Um.
I don't
yeah, this is
I don't know
the way
the awakening
stuff.
I have no idea
when that comes
into effect.
There's all these
other
things that
happen when I
do that.
Um, that
that always
takes effect.
If there's
something in your
awakening thing
happens, then it's
it's there.
So you've
got
assume a
terrifying form.
then it
would become
frightened.
Coaching
presence
seeing
what
would be
such
and
thoughts.
We can
have
service.
so the
encroaching
presence is
backlash when
that happens.
We haven't
really been
monitoring
backlash too
much on
this.
not a
thing that
we're going
to really
deal with
because
otherwise I'd
be having
Scott roll
for backlash
every time
he tightens
swings and
we haven't
to do
that.
Oh,
oh,
okay.
So I'm
not going to
force a
backlash thing
for you.
Um,
okay.
Okay.
So I
don't
think
you
probably
the
creature
fails a
flat check
against
and
seemingly
for
people
who
is
frightened.
It doesn't
reduce the
frightened
connection.
From
this
effect
we
end at
the same
turn
game
this
connection.
Um,
so yeah,
we can
we can
do that.
So she'll
roll
d20
if she
um,
if she
rolls under
a five
then
then
she is
frightened.
Okay.
She didn't
she's not
frightened.
She's not
frightened.
Okay.
So now
we got
Velcro.
Sorry.
It's going
to be
Tardink
here.
Um,
She's going
to,
you know
what?
She's just
gonna
attack
with
claw.
Dele,
oh,
sorry.
Wrong,
wrong,
wrong.
But
so she
lunges
at you
with her
claws
digging
deep
into
your
chest
here
doing
26
points
of
damage
to
you.
Um,
then
she
and she'll
cast
a spell
which
she's
she's
going to
cast
a spell
which
will
provoke
your,
um,
nimbus
so you
can take
an attack
of
opportunity
if you
so
desire.
Yeah,
get her.
Now or
later?
now.
When
it's
my stuff
go.
Just a
regular
old
strike.
Yeah,
it's
just
going to
be a
regular
old
strike.
So
nothing
special,
just a
regular
strike.
No
titan
swing,
no
nothing.
Yeah.
Oh,
because it's
not my
turn,
that stuff
doesn't
show up
on the
bottom I
usually
use.
Is that
true?
Oh,
um,
if you
click on
your
strike.
Oh.
Well,
you do
miss,
so.
Yep.
So she
casts a
spell,
and the
spell that
she casts
is
invisibility,
and she
goes
invisibility.
Okay.
All right,
we got a
nightmare.
It's got to
move up
here.
it's going
to
hoof
a
Samir.
Running
up and
hoofing.
For
29 to
hit.
And
just for
the record,
because you
had
your
solar are
active,
he did
not
crit.
So you,
if it
wasn't,
you would
have been
critted on.
No.
Am I
misunderstanding
the eerie
flicker to
be a
thing that
like,
I become
concealed for
one round.
So he
would still
need to
make his
flat check.
Oh, yeah,
you're right.
He would still
need to make
his flat
check.
And actually
going by
that,
I'm just
going to
add the
concealed
condition to
you.
And I'm
going to
just attack
again so
that it's
handled by
the
automation.
Okay.
There's a chance
fail.
Missed now.
Wow.
Okay.
So he
critically hit.
However,
his hoof
passed me
where you
were when
you did
the,
when,
when you
flickered out
of existence
so it
missed
you.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
All in
all,
that was
very helpful.
That was
pretty good.
It's a good
thing you
remembered.
It was
a good
time.
Well,
it didn't
crit you
the first
time,
but it
almost
crit you
the first
time.
bloody
close.
Yeah.
I mean,
I'm just
easy to hit.
I'm
soft.
Yeah.
All right,
Karsten,
you're up.
When we
finish this
round,
we'll just
go ahead
and pause
it.
It's
sounds good.
Pushing
10 o'clock.
Mm-hmm.
Oh,
buddy.
Oh,
Clark,
I
forgot
that you
you're not
grabbed
anymore.
So why
don't you
go ahead
and just
re-roll
that stuff?
I
removed
the
grabbed
condition.
Is that's
possible that
that got
in the
way of
some
of your
rolls?
I
don't
know if
it does,
but just
go ahead
and re-roll
your
test.
Oh.
Jesus
priest.
Oh,
my gosh.
Oh,
my gosh.
Oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
Clark,
you should
not be
taking
after Jason
when you're
rolling.
Oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
I'm
sorry,
man.
Oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
okay,
well,
you hit
with something.
force card
noise on
mute.
I don't
know.
Oh,
I'm talking
to myself.
I was like,
no reaction
from that.
Probably
pretty good
to talk
to myself.
Yeah.
Well,
the funny
thing is,
like,
I must have
been doing
a really
good job
responding
to your
statements
that you
weren't
making,
that you
were making
that I
wasn't
here.
You did.
Nice job.
I give
you
kudos.
So,
there you
go.
All right.
Well,
Samir,
you're up.
I think
I'm finally
in range.
I just
don't have
enough
actions.
You know
what I
mean?
Yeah.
It's a real
problem.
Yeah.
If every
spell
can take
two
actions,
it'd be
fantastic,
but every
spell does.
Um,
um,
yeah,
so I
think
Oh,
um,
Clark,
when you
successfully
hit the
blood hag,
um,
I'm going
to need
you to
make a
DC 26
reflex
save.
Yeah,
I'm not
going to
hit it,
so.
I don't,
I don't
matter.
Oh,
you'd
make it.
That's
what I
need to
say every
time.
Love your
optimism.
All right.
Oh,
well,
I said
really much
optimism around.
All right.
Um,
I know the
feeling.
Surprising.
Clark,
you,
when,
when you
attack her,
the fire,
like her fiery
form just
flames out
as you
hit her.
Um,
and it
deals an
additional,
it does
four points
of fire
damage to
you.
Okay.
Is it
automatic or
I got a,
nope,
you did
it.
Yep.
All right.
So you're
good.
No,
you're,
you're not
good.
You need,
you need
health.
You need
health and
healing.
Yeah.
All right,
Samir,
now,
now you're
up.
I,
I don't
have a,
I don't
if I
put myself
here in
this location
there,
right here,
right?
I can,
I'm within
reach of
Carson.
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
Yeah,
you are.
You know
what?
That's,
I don't
even,
I thought
I needed
to be,
I do
not.
Okay.
So,
yeah,
then we'll,
nope,
that's not
what I
need.
I need
this.
He is
targeted.
We will
do
this.
Okay.
That gives
him the
haste.
You're
hasting
him.
I'm
hasting
him.
Okay.
So,
you're
hasting
who?
Drop
you.
Karsten,
you.
And
you get
a,
get your
Draconic
Blood
Magic for
that as
well.
So,
Clark,
what that
means is
you have
four
actions
now.
One of
them you
have to
use as
either the
strike action
or the
move action.
plus strike
action or
what?
Move.
You get
an,
you get an
extra action
every round,
but it has
to be the
strike action
or the
move action.
It can't be
any of your
special abilities
or special
hits.
It just has
to be the
strike or
move.
no,
every,
when your
turn comes
up,
every,
every time
your turn
comes up.
Jason,
I hate to
tell you,
buddy,
you're a,
you're a
turn late.
Uh,
yeah,
yeah.
Uh,
well,
you know,
we're still
learning this
stuff.
I appreciate
it,
though.
I'm just
saying,
I don't think
I'm going to
make it.
You're going
to make it.
I'm not
going to make
it,
buddy.
Um,
no,
you're going
to make it.
Uh,
all right.
And that's
Samira's
turn.
That's
I don't
know what
else to do
with this.
Oh,
yeah,
you got,
you got a
third.
You got a
third action.
I'm sorry.
I don't
have.
Well,
I guess I
could do
this.
Yeah,
I'll just
cast.
If you
have a
one action
attack,
um,
that would
be helpful
because every
little bit of
damage against
this blood
hag is going
to be helpful
as long as
she's around
like it.
I mean,
you need me
dropping bodies
here.
Right.
Things are
going to go
real,
real bad for
you real,
real quick.
Perfect.
Perfect.
So if
you've got
any way
to do
damage
for one
action,
Jason,
I would
highly
recommend
it.
I thought,
um,
I thought I
could do
this
Thunderstone
thing,
or the
bottled
lightning.
Oh,
that's not
what I
wanted to
do.
Well,
it's the
Thunderstone,
whatever.
I thought
this was
something
like it
was like
a projectile
I could
throw it
and,
um,
is that
not the
case?
The
Thunderstone?
Yeah,
I don't know
why it's here.
I don't know
how to get
it out.
You're going
away.
Will they
target one
feature that's
in the
age?
Um,
range 20
feet.
Okay.
I deleted
it from
the,
um,
the,
the,
the
conversation.
Sorry.
Oh,
well,
really all
you need to
do is go
into your
attacks.
There's a
Thunderstone
entry in
there and
then just
click on
the strike
with it.
Um,
and I
mean,
obviously
target
the
blood
hang
though.
Um,
hit it,
hit it,
please.
Oh,
not on
a two,
you're
not.
Hey,
there you
go,
buddy.
Back to
normal.
go.
Uh,
okay.
So it
does have
splash
damage.
So,
so.
Oh,
but that
only happens
on the
critical hit.
So,
no,
so you,
you flung
the stone,
you hit
it,
it goes
off,
but,
um,
the,
uh,
the blood
hag appears
to be
unaffected.
All right,
now I'll
worry,
you're up.
Sorry.
All right,
no worries.
Um,
yep,
that's just
gonna be the
best thing
to do.
So,
what's
what we're
gonna do?
Um,
I will
cast,
I don't
want to
keep
that.
Yeah,
I'm gonna
cast
third level
soothe
onto
Karsten.
Which
will,
it's not
bad,
30 heal.
We like
it.
and then
I'm going
to transfer
uh,
let's
give more
than one.
Let's
transfer
five hit
points to
Kahir,
uh,
which
will
also
immediately
give you
a move.
yeah,
Scott,
I'll
give you
that
five
there.
So you
healed five
and now
you can
move
your full
move.
so
oh,
oh,
oh,
oh,
we're
there.
Yep.
And it's
your turn
next,
so you
can just
get to
murdering.
I mean,
move into
a flanking
position first
and then
get to
murdering.
There you
go.
I would
suggest.
But it is
your turn.
Do it as
you please.
Okay.
Titan
swing.
Yeah.
Get
her.
She
doesn't
seem so
nice to
you anymore.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No.
Well,
she doesn't
have any
more skin.
Well,
that's
true,
right?
It's
pretty
gross.
It's
the
details.
You're
right.
Big
money.
It's
pretty good
money.
Big
money.
Nice
job.
Triple
the
money.
Oh,
weak sauce.
Terrible.
These
weren't
big.
27.
How
did
she
have?
Oh,
crap.
A lot.
That's my
turn.
I tightened
her.
Oh,
yeah.
You're
tightened.
Yep,
yep,
yep.
Well,
that's
not
great.
No,
well.
Nope.
No,
no,
that's
not
great.
Nobody's
feeling good
here.
All right.
All right,
guys.
Well,
that's
the
beginning
of the
round,
so I
think at
this point
we're
post 10,
so we'll
go ahead and
call it for
now.
Sounds
good.
Next
session
will have
to be
a month
out
as
Ramsey
is going
to be
hanging out
in the
tropics
next
time
around.
But when
we finish
that off,
then we'll
when we
finish this
and,
you know,
get to
the next
stage,
we'll
kind of
talk about
kind of
what my
thoughts
are as
far as
what we're
doing next,
get your
thoughts on
it,
and then
or,
you know,
moving forward
and that kind
of stuff,
and then we'll
go from
there.
That works
for everybody.
Sounds
good.
It works.
Right.
Let's
see it.
Here
are
you
