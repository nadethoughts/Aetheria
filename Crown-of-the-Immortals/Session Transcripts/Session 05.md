Just to get everybody caught up to what's happened in the past six months. So I'll get through this as quickly as quickly as I can. And I am also going to be, posting let's see. We'll put it in the game chat. Oh, thank god.

We figured out how to shut that stupid song music off. Jason, you're still playing. I don't wanna stop. There's a gear. Click on the gear, and there will be an exit option.

So, Kahir, during your inter during your interim, you embrace the next six months as a time of preparation, both for yourself and the community. Continue to strengthen your bond with your sister and angel, sharing concerns about the strange occurrences surrounding the temple. You also find yourself thinking more and more about protect the protection of the people of this town. During this time, Galt played a surprising role. Galt being your brother, lives out in the woods, doesn't really like didn't really like society, played a surprising role for both you and the community.

Gald had several encounters with the goblins in the woods. These encounters were not mere skirmishes. They were calculated ambushes meant to probe Gald's knowledge of the land, of the temple's surroundings. Though Gald managed to escape each time, the encounters left him rattled. After much thought, he swallowed his pride and reported the Goblet and Strange tactics to you, warning, warning that their numbers were growing and that something dark seemed to be driving them.

Despite your rivalry, Gauld's information proved to be invaluable to the town's leadership. As Ahirs armed armed the or as you armed the town's militia with your expertly crafted weapons, You also found that you had a knack for engineering battlements and fortifying the town. You also kept an eye on your brother's reports, and, and people and people of the town are starting to look to you in a new way and defer to you. Carsten. Carsten, you spent these months in deep reflection, unraveling the mystery of the coronal prism and how it could be used to repair the time turner.

You spent time studying studying ancient texts and investigating strange temporal phenomenon surrounding the temple, determined to uncover any leads that might point them towards towards more chrono prisms. You took the news of the goblins' activity seriously, working closely with the leadership. While Cahir's approach was to fortify the town, you took a more proactive approach in taking a unit of solar systems and seeking them out. Being empowered by the information you got from Gald, you tracked the majority of the goblins' activities to be in the direction of the burned wood. Thus, you have not been able to find thus far, you've not been able to find their location, but have a new but have had a few skirmishes with them as you have delved deeper into the area.

Your growing role in the community cemented your reputation as military leader, protector, and champion of the Solaris sentinels. You know the come in the coming month you know the coming months are critical, not just for the town, but the entire continent of Solaris. Mhmm. No pressure. Right?

Oh, he's been his character's been living under pressure this entire Still. Alwar Alwar, the events of the temple had left you filled with both purpose and uncertainty. Over the six months, you returned to your role as the community's cheerful morale booster, but found yourself drawn more and more into the mysteries of the time turner. The visions you experienced in the temple had awakened a deeper connection cadence and gave you the give you insight into the time altering magic surrounding the chrono prism. In addition to your role in the town, you regain training you began training your magical abilities in secret, experimenting with strain with the strange bardic spells and new abilities that you had begun to manifest.

You knew that this newfound power these newfound powers were tied to the Lanaux or Song of Creation, and that in order to complete the completely repair the Great Time Turner, you not only needed to find the coronal prism, but you need to find the right refrain from the Lanouille to to complete the repair. The Lanouille and the Great Time Turner are connected somehow, but you're not sure exactly what the connection is, nor are you are you specifically nor do you specifically need to do nor nor what you specifically need to do to get it. But you you know the key is you know it is the key somehow. Sorry. That was a little bit over the place.

And Sameer. Sameer, you used the six months to train and unlock new powers, honing your draconic and experimenting with your abilities. While you remained somewhat detached from the town, you contributed here and there helping Cahir at the forge and subtly adding some enhancements to the weapons, armor, and defenses using your draconic heritage. While you feel most comfortable by yourself having been apart from having been a part of two worlds but not quite a part of either, you you have thoughts of you have thoughts of Cahir and Angel as they both are not part of the orc world nor the human world but have but are able to thrive. In your seclusion, you start to feel the presence of your mother and start to hear whispers on the wind of a time of great need for your power.

How you were brought into this world to be a vision of what could be. Old hatreds died along with the flaming retribution. It could be a unifier or a or pea a unifier of people as long as you don't get in your own way. And I have each each of you have also experienced a vision. I'm going to be sending a private message to you with this vision.

Alright. So as far as I I just have one more thing before we jump in, and it's just like next steps kinda where we're at. You know? The party now understands that the temporary fix using the star metal will not last. You must find the find the chrome chromo prisms, which is a type of, a type of type of gem, that you can use to permanently repair the time turner before the goblins can activate it.

With with Galt's reports about the goblins increasing increasing presence and their obsession with the time turner, Time is running out. You have heard, you in your research to figure out more about the chronal prisons, you did hear that chronal prisons might chronal prisons, not chronal prisons, might be able to be found in the Twilight Spire and the Evershipped Caverns, which are places that existed in the old world, but may not necessarily still exist in the new one. Both places are known to be warped by temporal magic and might contain enough chronal prisms to complete the repairs. You must decide your next move knowing that each day brings goblins closer to their goal. So the question is, are you guys going to go searching for the chrono prism right away?

Are you going to be starting to pursue, try try to figure out where this refrain refrain from the Lanoue is or face the goblins that are are an encroaching threat on the town? Or do something else completely because you do have that option. So just for my information, I guess, so the goblins are trying to get into the town to activate the time turner? That is the that's the impression that you're getting from Gald, when he in the encounters that he had with them. They appear to be very focused on getting back to the, they appeared to be very focused on getting back to the temple.

They were trying to see if there was a better way to make it to to make it to the temple than the route that had exploded on Mhmm. The cave in that happened. Yep. Yep. Yep.

These little boys know more about this than we do, maybe. Right? Maybe not. Yeah. And and and and the Inggol did pick up, like, information about them talking about activating it.

So you don't know what will happen if it's activated and you don't know what the purpose of activating it is, but you do know that that appears to be the Goblin's goals. Gotcha. Yep. Probably generally bad. Okay.

Right. Right. Cool. Cool. Cool.

How so, the past six months, especially, here in Carston have spent kind of, helping the town build their militia, stabilize things, drive the goblins back. Galt's been helping with that. How successful have those endeavors been? Are things relatively stable, or is it still, like, on the brink any day the town might fall to the goblins? So from what you have from what you've seen, it's kind of a day by day.

You will have some success in the skirmishes and taking in and taking taking out the goblins and that kind of thing. And then after after about two or three weeks, there seems to be a surge of them. Okay. So there appear to be more that keep on coming in. Sure.

Sure. But there is, like, a time of reprieve, essentially. It's not a constant? Correct. Correct.

Especially with the especially with the help that, the town has been getting from, you know, Karsten's, Karsten's, forays in in adults' battlements and and preparations and things, that he's been working on with the with the town leadership. You are in a relatively safe place. I mean, the kids are still able to, like, go out and and play in the streets and that kind of thing, but it's one of those things where you don't go too far away from town Yeah. As a normal person. Yep.

Yep. Yep. Okay. Alright. Well, I'll I'll kind of I assume we're all gathered somewhere.

Yeah. You, go for it, Ramsey. Sorry. Oh, I don't know about you guys, but feel like these, we stick around and just keep trying to fight these goblins off. It's just kind of delaying, my vote's to try to win.

Go after the thing that could seal this thing up for good. I don't have any real solid leads on the on the anode yet, but we have any idea. We think we know where we might find these, these gems, these, these these prisms. That's that's my vote. As much as I would like to, fight as many goblins as possible, I think oh oh, just a minute.

Don't move. I'm gonna say his name wrong. Arwal? Arwal? Arwal.

Close. Right? It's time turner, would probably be the best way to go. Yeah. I concur.

I think fighting the goblins in never ending battle, they seem to be spawning, respawning, and spawning some more. So Just like rabbits. It's less of a just just to paint the picture, it's less of a rabbit sort of situation and it's more along the lines of like, and you got this from Gald as well. Like, there's there appears to be some dark force that is driving the goblins. So the impression that you get is there's some boss figure that is basically forcing the goblins to continue their assault.

Yeah. That that was just a bad joke about rabbits reproducing since there's so many goblins coming. Well, no. No. But yeah.

I I just wasn't sure if I I wasn't sure if I clarified that where it's like there it's not like there's a never ending source of goblins here. It's that you guys get to get some success, and then somebody imports a bunch of goblins to be able to overrun the overrun the town. And so you're basically having a kind of a cat and mouse back and forth sort of situation. Yeah. Okay.

David Bowie is behind the scenes somewhere pulling some bricks. David Bowie's codpiece. Nice. Oh, David Bowie. That was good.

That's a very important cog piece, by the way. Oh my gosh. Oh, gosh. Yeah. Okay.

Yeah. I'm of the same mind. I I I think we need to do a little scouting and and see if we can determine if these places even exist. Yeah. So, on that, we give ourselves twenty four hours to make preparations and head out.

Sounds good. I like that. Alright. If you guys do go over to map the Twilight Spire, you might want to scroll out a little bit. The Twilight Spire is here.

Okay. In the middle of that lake? Yeah. In the middle of the lake. Good.

Well, I gotta hit the mountain lake. Okay. And we're in this town. Yep. And the Evershift yeah.

And the Evershift Caverns are located around here. Okay. Can you redo that one more time, Chris? Right? Yep.

Right there. That's right there? Yeah. Where Ramsey Sky is? About the same distance, roughly.

They are, just in different directions. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It looks like there was a a town Yeah.

On the edge of the lake? There was. Yes. Okay. May still be.

Who knows? May still be there. Yeah. Maybe ruckus. Yeah.

Maybe That drain looks flatter. Across the lake. Yeah. That's fair. There was a river that went that way, but at the moment, if unless the river's been severely redirected, it seems also not to be there anymore.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It looks like if the river's by our tower, any indication, things have shifted pretty drastically. Clark, the little mountain in the middle of the lake above us is where the first thing was, the twilight what was that called, Chris?

The Twilight's Fire? Yes. Where the shards are? Yep. Yeah.

So those are the two places those are the two places that might have the, the chrono prisms. Okay. So quick question, Chris. I think I know the answer, just given what I've seen on this map here. But where we're at in this fork on this river, I assume that these two forks are flowing southeast into this one fork and not the other way around?

Correct. Okay. Alright. Alright. Just wanna make sure.

So going north, we would be going a dense flow of the river? You would be going up river. Yeah. No. Okay.

Alright. Cool. Cool. That's what I figured. Just checking.

Yeah. Well, just wanna have this on another, I guess. Yeah. One consideration, I guess. If if there were other survivors Mhmm.

And other settlements, they will choose bodies of waters, to make their settlement near True. As part of the expedition. I think, you know, like, that would be a valuable piece of information to figure out. So I guess my immediate inclination would be to to maybe follow that fork that it generally runs north in that direction, follow that river to raise up and see where it goes, knowing that we'd have to be here a little bit to the west. If you did want to follow the river, then, I mean, that river that you guys are on, you don't really have any map of which direction it goes.

Correct. But you do know the coastline fairly well. I mean, the coast well, assuming that the coastline didn't change very much, which I will not answer that question one way or the other. But, you do also have the option of just going going with the river and then basically just kind of moving out of the river when you when you get to a certain point as well if you're concerned about going with the river. But, really, at that point, it's just more along the lines of do you wanna be going downriver on the way to the place or Yeah.

Or downriver from the place. You know? So Yeah. Let's say we go to the Twin Spires. Sure.

Sounds good. Alright. So you guys are choosing to go to the Twilight Spire. Correct? Yeah.

You want to move? Yeah. Right. Looks like God's done. After I, oh, what's that?

I saw a thing in my inventory and clicked on it. That was, bit of I don't know what it was. Scroll rock something we picked up in the temple. K. Yeah.

We've we've seen that before. Mhmm. I forgot what it was, and I clicked on it. Alright. Yep.

North is good as me. Hey. Good team. So you're going to be taking the, taking some time to prep forward for your journey north. That's correct.

Obviously, you're going to be they're gonna provide you with some sort of map, but, again, the map may or may not be accurate. Okay. Any special preparations that you guys are gonna be doing for that? Anybody good with orienteering? Good at what?

Orienteering. I don't know what that is. Using using a a compass and map to get wherever the heck you wanna go anywhere. No. I am trained in If you're trained in survival, then you are good at orienteering to some extent to community.

Yep. Yep. I don't survive anything. I'm dead. I'm not.

Survival. I only can survive in this thing already. What the heck? Anyway oh, that's why. Stupid.

Anyhow. Okay. Any so does anybody have any any special any special things they do? I mean, you guys basically are just heading are just heading north in the morning? Yeah.

I'll just stop and get some, hopefully, some food Yeah. For my backpack. And, I mean, that's all I really need. Yeah. Do you know how assuming our map was accurate, how many days journey we were looking at roughly?

That'd be months. Oh, that's months? Months. Yeah. Okay.

Oh, wow. Yeah. We nobody nobody at this point had like, you've got some pack animals, but you don't have, like, riding horses or anything. So it was so it's traveling by foot at this point. Right.

So, yeah, you we're we're talking we're talking a few months at least to get all the way up there. Gotcha. That may change some things then. It was not At the same distance to the other one? Oops.

Roughly. Roughly. Yeah. You might be able to save some time on on the other one because it's downriver, but you're but on the travel back, you're going to be having having some problems. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. So we're, like I if if Yeah. I I'm trying to remember off the top of my head. I want you to know how wonderful that is.

But I'm pretty sure that every, that every hex is two weeks to travel. So so Ah, okay. You're looking at, you know, start in your starting town just to get to the edge of what you can see, that's that's a month. Yep. Yep.

Yep. Yep. There, it'd be two, three, three and a half. Okay. Alright.

Well If you if you can score yourself some riding animals or or, you know, stuff like that, then obviously, that makes it a lot quicker. But if you're traveling by foot, from which at this point, the town that's all that the town has, the ability to provide is Yeah. You might be able to get a pack animal to kinda help carry the stuff, but, there are no riding horses that anybody has at the moment. Should we try to get a packed animal then? Because we're gonna need food.

Well, I'm just more concerned about if the town's gonna exist in six months by the time we get back. Being gone for a few days or a week or two is one thing, but we're gonna we're talking about being gone for six months now. I don't I'm concerned the town may not hold out against the goblins that long. That's a whole different time scale. Well, how far from our guesstimate would it take from goblins to get from that other mountain range to here?

Do you know what I mean? They have to cross rivers. They appear to just appear. Oh, I see. They're not even alright.

You're not seeing you're not seeing We might need to take care of that evil. Force marched. Yeah. Yeah. I remember might need to go to the big evil force.

Someone was starting to get a b on where they were coming from, but nothing concrete. Is that correct? Do I remember reading and seeing that somewhere? Yeah. That is correct.

Gold had Galt had specifically been running into them more frequently from the from the burn from the Burning woods from the Burned Woods Burn Woods. Which is which is down here. Oh, okay. And that's where Karsten was able to where Karsten was able to get to, able to have some sores in there. Okay.

Go down down south a little bit? Down south a bit. Yeah. They're way closer. Like, not fully in the Burning Woods, but Sure.

Sure. Because Karsten still tries to keep relatively close to town. Yep. Well, south of that direction somewhere. Okay.

Yeah. With, that's Sorry. I wasn't trying. Looking at the the big old map, it's like, I don't know about this plane anymore, guys. Maybe maybe this isn't such a good idea.

That's, it's a long way. My legs are real short. Now what do we what do you guys think? You're the ones who've been kinda getting the town ready for these goblins. Do you think they can last?

Chris, is there some time is there a a a role I can make to help have a more educated guess? Sure. There's always a role. Good. Me like you.

The role would be you have some sort of, if you one, it would be if you have some sort of, battle lore skill, this would be an appropriate time to use that. I don't know what your, lores look like, but everybody should have at least one. I have no lore at all. That really makes sense. Your background should give you a lore.

I have no lore skills. Instead of execution. Unless I'm missing something. You're trained in warfare lore. That's not on my my not on my skills thing.

It didn't get added automatically. I'll just add it. Oh, okay. Cool. Your back your background always gives you a lure.

Yep. Yep. So we you said you're adding a lure? Yes. Yeah.

If you open up your background, it'll it'll tell you. Like, if you edit if you edit your background, it'll it'll give you one. Like, alloy smith, is trained in the crafting skill and the plane of plane of metal lore skill. So you know about the elemental plane of metal as an alloy smith. Okay.

So, yeah, Clark. I would say that your warfare lore applies. So Perfect. Warfare. Yeah.

That's true. Here we go, red team. Oh, oh, oh, over here. Nice. Take it.

Alright. So, Carsten, based off of the battlements and kind of how how, you guys for the past six months past six months have been under siege, you are able to assess kind of the strength of the enemy for the most part. And if things stay as they are right now, you're confident that the pound can hold out for a while. However, you've seen things escalating and continuing to escalate, and that brings that brings you pause. So if things stay the same, you guys can leave.

There won't be any problem. They'll be able to hold out for that time period. However, you do not if if things continue to escalate and there be, and more and more goblins appear to be coming, unless you guys are able to make a decisive blow to to break the morale of of these goblins, the the the town will be overrun. Okay. I'd let the group know that, that with our walls kind of looking at the map again and us talking about it.

Good to know. What? Yeah. Once you start looking at it. Yeah.

Yeah. That I would make a recommendation that we take care of the evil as things keep increasing before we head out to find the material, north of us because it will be a longer journey. And we might not have a as our wall has said, we might not have a city to return to. I'm good. Well, I think it would be prudent to do that.

Are there thoughts on that on that particular subject? I grab I'll grab my ax in both hands and say, let's get after it. Yep. Alright. I love the, enthusiasm.

So getting after the goblins? We are. It's what it's looking like. Yes. How are you getting after the goblins?

Tim, the goblin will, like, take us to the areas where he's seeing the most or towards the Burnt woods, is what you're asking? Yep. Right. So so your plan is to head towards the Burnt Woods and try and see if you can figure out, get get a little bit better of a bead for where they are. Are you are you gonna be taking any, any backup with this, or are you guys going to be going you're gonna be flying solo?

Or I mean, are we splitting up our party? No. No. No. No.

I'm not suggesting that. No. I'm I'm just asking, are are you bringing are you bringing additional additional solar sentinels, or is this something that you guys wanna have, like, you guys as a crack team just going after it, and that kind of a thing or some other thing. I mean, I've given you options, but you don't have to choose any of the options that I give you. So I guess my question is This is not a trick question.

I'm not trying to get I'm not trying to catch you guys in anything. So Oh, my concern with taking too many people is I don't wanna leave the the city undefended Mhmm. Would be my thought. So, I mean, maybe we could take a few, but I don't know how many sentinels there are. There aren't that many.

At this point, you guys are about 20 strong. So Okay. What is the population of the town overall? Got it somewhere around here, but I wanna say five or 600. Okay.

So it's a relatively small town. But Yeah. Yeah. Well, that makes sense. So I kinda I'm I'm voting to keep the 20 sentinels there to make sure everything is okay, but I could be convinced otherwise.

I see a bunch of head nods, so I'm assuming the rest of the group is with you. I I I heard you on that. Here, can your is your brother willing to give us a a a guide out there to start with? That might be good. Yeah.

Yeah. That's that's what I was thinking. He should go with us. Okay. Alright.

So it sounds like, Kihir, you need to head over and ask your head head over to your brother's hut, which is about two or three hours outside of the town. He does not stay with, within the bowels of the town. Still mistrust it. Is he towards the Burnt woods? He is.

Yes. He's a lot of He's on the other side of the on the other side of the on the other side of the fork a little bit. So alright. So you head back over there. You head down to his huts, and I roll an intimidation check.

Just keep thinking about that. Intimidating your brother? Fine. That's it. To make sure that he doesn't intimidate us or what?

So No. I mean, he seems to be wanting to be involved and connected with this, so I think he'd be a pretty easy Right. Convincer. Convincing. He could be a guide.

So you walk over to or you you head over to his huts. As you walk, up to, as you walk up to his hut, you see him outside chopping wood with a very large axe. It's not quite as big as, as Cahir's, but, it is a very sizable axe that looks like it's made for a little bit more than chopping wool. But that's what he's using it for at the moment. You hear the thunk thunk thunk of the, of the axe falling on the wood over and over and over again.

He eventually raises his head, takes notice of you, and says, oh, brother, what brings you to my neck of the woods? We're going on in the future. He's continuing to continuing to, chop wood. An adventure, you say. Well, I would start with how much we appreciate him bringing in all the information and asks if he wants to use that x and put that to better use than chopping wood.

And this towards the goblins partake in helping us find where they're come coming from. Was he able to help, like, become part of the party in that a little bit, or we probably don't trust him enough to go to battle with yet? I mean, really, it's it's, it's your estranged relationship, so you you tell us. I didn't hear that. Woah.

Nope. Yeah. Oh, no. You're robot. People.

Robot. I'm being the burner burner. There you go. Hear me. Okay.

We can hear you now. Yeah. That was better. Appreciate it. I'm beginning to trust him more and more with over the last six months because of his information and his stance towards the people.

And his stance toward the goblins. Oh. Yeah. Yes. Hatreds of the goblins.

That's fair. Did I that picture of, called is he full orc? Is he half brother? He's a half brother. Full orc.

Okay. Half brother. Alright. That makes sense. Yeah.

That's tomorrow. Son, I believe. Dad's son. Yeah. Right.

Kind of was dad betrayed his mother to marry or get with whatever I said at the beginning. My mother and the sister that we have that's in the town, she's half pork like me. Okay. So he's the, you know, he's the son of the first marriage. So he has a little bit of a chip on his shoulder about his siblings.

Yep. Yep. Yep. Gotcha. And he thinks he can me, but that's yet to be decided.

Alright. We are also at the end of our first, of our first hour of play, so everybody is getting one additional hero point. Yay. Hero points. Alright.

Alright. I need to He If he can go with or no? Yeah. Go ahead and roll a, say, a charm. One second before I tell you.

I don't even know the charm exists in this game. It doesn't There's something like that. Or diplomacy? Yeah. I think that's the closest.

Diplomacy. That one. Let's try a different one. Well, you can try to intimidate him into coming along, but No. I don't I don't know about help the relationship.

I mean, I can do the see, but a big zero for me. So you're just looking at straight roll? That is roll good. Oh, see? Wow.

You just had to roll good. Nice. Alright. Perfect. Yay.

That's all you need to do is a little high number. Just throw it well. Yeah. Okay. I can't wait to roll something.

Gold Gold looks at you approvingly and says it would be good to sharpen my blade. He looks at the rest of the group and says, yep. Comes back. Looks at the rest of the group and says, I'm not sure about these guys, though. Oh, I'm not one for swinging axes, but I got some tricks up my sleeves.

I'm no good with weapons either. Alright. And I just stare at them. Let's see. Well, come back to appreciate their parts.

Alright. He should know a little bit about them by now. Well, he does he does when he when he says it, you know, he he gives Auer and Sameer a very scrutinizing look, but he gives Carson a little bit of a wink because they've been out together already. So Mhmm. Mhmm.

He's aware of what Carson is able to do. He says, I am not Perfect. Prepared to leave just yet, though. When when when do you wanna when do you wanna do this? Where where basically possible.

Yeah. Oh, it's so Do you like a night ring? Best to move best to move out in in the the early morning if if at all possible. How about tomorrow morning? That's good.

Get a camp at his hut. Yeah. That's what I say. Is that He probably had a fresh kill. Well, be nice to him so that he'll share it with us.

Or just get a fresh kill ourselves. That too. Okay. So, if you if you guys have your all your travel gear with you, you know, his hut is at is pretty much just a hut. So, it doesn't really have enough space for, really anybody but him inside it.

Okay. But you are welcome to find a soft bit of grass, to try and start bedding down for the night. That is what I'll be doing. Looks like Also gonna lead us into an ambush, though. So That would be hilarious, by the way.

And it would be your brother, and I would blame you for your dysfunction. Not him from the goblins is what I'm saying. Well, you know, you never know. But It's not saying that I'm going to ambush you guys. Right.

And I'll be back before we get there. Oh, good. We we got an extra ax for it. So Right? Maybe.

Yeah. Find a bed down and rest for the morning. I'm sure we have some stuff with us. I'm gonna climb up a tree. That sounds like an athletics check.

Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's right. That's right. Chris is the name, Licious.

He's gonna do it. Oh, like, athletics. Yeah. Let's just see. I have no modifier for that.

Oh, look at that. It's average. That that's a good roll for me. So you a good roll. You aren't you are in fact able to shimmy up a tree, but it's not a big one.

I chose poorly. You're a little bit you're a little bit off the ground, and you're able to perch up there. But, it's not very comfortable, and, you know, you're not gonna get very much rest. No. There's a knot that keeps on poking in the back.

Yeah. Sleeping in trees is dangerous. Craft a, Chris, can I craft a, possible early warning system? Well, yeah. I I think that you should be able to come up with something.

I mean, you you you, I'm not sure if you can go ahead and rail or something. Yeah. Go and roll with graphing. Oh, oh, good. K.

Well, you you set something up. You're you're not sure if it's actually going to work the way that you want it to, but it was the best you could come up with on the fly. So it's not one of those things where you did a bad job and you're like, I did amazing. You know? It it's you you know it's it's probably not the best, but, given the rudimentary tools that you have and kind of the place that you're in, it's kind of best that you could do under these circumstances.

Alright. Ready for bed then. Alright. And click back. Hopefully not because he probably turned on his camera.

He was Oh, I'm here. I'm eating. I didn't think of anything else. There then. Okay.

Yes. That's fine. I just wanted to I wanted to make sure that I had everybody there. So you start you start bedding down for the night. Understood.

You've got, you know, about ten, fifteen minutes into your attempt to sleep, and you hear a large bang to the north. What? You're too far out to hear anything from the town because, called is about two hours outside of town. Oh. But it definitely came from the town's direction.

Gotcha. Gotcha. It was like a like a it wasn't like an explosion. It was just like a a a large bang. Alright.

What was Did you hear that? Yeah. What was that? I don't know. It's coming north.

Like a metallic clang or like a big heavy thing, thud? What role perception? Or like a boom. Preception. Preception.

Dang it. There is no active encounter. Boom. Where is there's a way to do this. I just always do it the wrong way.

Yeah. There there are two, there are two methods here. Yeah. Just go on the very left there. Can't you just It's in for questions.

Instead of attributes, you go to skills, and then is it in there? No. It's not in there. In there. That's why I always have a problem.

They're percepting way to the left. And then yeah. I think you might just have to open your character sheet. Yeah. Turn the lane, but Oh, okay.

I see it. I see it now. Oh, it's not so bad. K. Anybody else who wants to roll a perception may do so as well.

Yes, please. This this all this is loud enough that it wakes everybody up. Oh. Perception. Oh, get off my thing.

Jerk. Boom. I'll take that. Alright. So, Alwar, okay here, what you find what you figure out is, that you are, you are very certain that there was a loud noise that was that that came from the direction of the town.

You are certain that it is from the town where this is at. Carsten, the loud noise, to you, it sounds like an explosion, but it was kind of a it's kind of a, a rumble. It's kind of a a a rumble, and you almost feel the vibrations in the ground. Alwer, you recognize that, you recognize that that was the sound of stones moving after something that was very large and it broke, like, crashed into him. It's almost like an avalanche style of Oh.

Of in in avalanche style of, of explosion. Uh-huh. And Sameer is too busy focusing on the knot in his back. No. Actually, I I got lost for a second.

Allison had a question for me, so I was like, alright. Well, I'm back now. Moments passed. Alright. Well, whatever that was, we should probably go check it out.

Well, I agree. Except for the fact that we gotta hike north. It's a long way. It's a long way. Yeah.

I don't disagree with you, though. Cool. And, like, just to add a sense of urgency urgency to this, this is coming from the town. You are under siege by goblins. Mhmm.

There it was a loud it it was a loud thing. It it was a loud noise. You don't know what happened. The for all you know, the town could be under rubble right now. So, just to add a little bit of perspective so it's not like, oh, man.

I have to I have to hike back up there. You know? I it might be a little bit more of a, oh, crap. The world just blew up. What you know?

The world literally years are falling again. So Yeah. Sure. Yeah. So Yep.

We might down from the tree very quickly. Yep. He's fine. Is gold, woke from this? Did he come out of his house?

Yeah. He he did wake up, and he walked out of the, walked out of the walked out of the Hudson. What was that? Oh, no. Something happened.

He was coming from the town. We need to go quickly. Yep. Alright. Throw on the backpack and a couple other items and start walking that way Yep.

Briskly. Yep. Yep. Start the start the Zoom. Alright.

So you grab your items, start running or briskly walking. So for for that, I will need a, I'll need a Fortitude Safe, from everyone just to check your check your long distance running skills. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Boo.

Average. That was actually, it was a little above average for me. So this is this is this one's a little important. I feel I'm gonna hero point this one. Yeah.

Me too. Oh. Me too. It added plus 10 to it? Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah. We're using we're using There we go. I bet, sir, if the rule's under 10, it adds 10 to it. Oh, yeah.

Yeah. I see. I don't feel like a 12 is horrible. That's a pretty good role for me. So Breathing out the curve.

Yeah. Based on that usual performance. But you have two but, Jason, just just for the record, you've got two hero points. I have two hero points. We have less than a and we have less than a half hour before this session ends.

Oh, that's true. So what do you say to your hero? Well, the next fortitude roll. How about that? Alright.

For those for those of you that rolled above a 15 Mhmm. You are able to, you're able to get to the, get to the, the town within a, it's two hour walk but you're moving at a very brisk pace so you're able to make it there within a within a half hour. Okay. For those of you that rolled under 15, you're able to keep up with everyone. However, you are sickened, you're a sickened one when you arrive.

You've got the run-in pukes. I've done that before. Yep. I I know that. I think we all have.

How do I do that? So if you go if you go on to your, if if you're using the, the little bar that has all this stuff in it, there's an effects, there's effects button that you can hover over and then just find sick and then click on it. Mhmm. Alright. And, for for the person who rolled a 24 Oh.

When combat begins, you will have you you will get a, you'll get a free round, at the beginning of combat. Good surprise round. Is there wait. Before before I do that, because that almost seems like I don't think so. Of course.

You don't think so. I don't think so at all. I think it sounds great. No. I'm I'm not gonna give you a surprise round, but I will give you a plus, a plus two tier initiative role.

Okay. That sounds good too. That sounds more appropriate because you've got there faster. You're better you're better for it, but you're able to, you know, jump into action a little bit better. That sounds great.

Alright. So you guys come cruising into the, into the town. Everything is a the the town is in a little bit is in a bit of a, has a bit of chaos running around. There isn't any you you fully expect there are goblins everywhere, but you don't see any. And you're like but people are running around.

People are really, kind of freaking out a bit. And, you you you stop you stop some people on on the road and go, what happened? What happened? And they said the temple. The temple is being overrun.

Yeah. That was my next thought. Convenient. Where, where are we where are we coming from? From below.

The that rock wall that was there, it's it's no longer there. Yep. Alright. We should go and jump down. Yep.

Excuse me. So as you as you head over to the hole, something that, there there's been a lot of work that's been done around the hole. The hole's actually kinda been fortified around it, and there's act and there is a spire or tower that goes down to the actual, to the to the actual, sand bridge that you guys fell into last night. Mhmm. So, over the past six months, there's been like, there there's been some fortification in in just building to be able to make it easier to get in and out of the in and out of the temple as people begun doing a little bit more research and trying to figure out what what what needs to happen with with the time temple.

You aren't the only people who've been interested in it. There are a number of different individuals in the community that are interested in learning in sequence. So as you approach the whole, you see that, out you you see that, there are, a number of goblin warriors that are, they're they're not quite, they're not quite to the temple yet. They're kind of, like, moving along the, moving along the, moving along the, the bridge, but they're heading towards the temple. There's not a you can't really see where they're coming from, but you would have expected having been, having been there, or have it having taken as long from the from the actual sounds to for you to get there, you would've you would've expected more.

Or they would've made more progress. But what you do notice is there are a lot of them, like, a lot. And so, it appears that it's been more of a, them getting their, like, assembling their forces, to go to to do a full on assault. So you do have enough time to make it down there, but, you are, there are way more goblins than you've ever fought at one time that that are that are there. Excellent.

Do you what do you do? Where are is there anyone else from our side around? Like, there are any sentinels? Yeah. Yeah.

How how quickly could you get them, Karsten? The, the sentinels are, some of them are around. Some of them but we do but you do also have quite a few of them that are still manning the battlements, looking for alternate, looking for additional attack, additional attacks. You might be able to grab one or two people to help out, but that's about that's about the extent of it. The rest of the rest of them, they're they're keeping they're keeping guard on the on the key points of the, of the village.

And, kind of like as you guys are as you guys are just kind of running up and taking assessment, you do notice that there are torches that are kind of appearing in the dust as well. So it definitely does seem like it's not, it's not just a one pronged assault. There there are definitely other other things that are happening here. Alright. Well, I've got off the portal.

Take it safe. Grab my. How else do this? I'm with you. I mean, we have two Sentinels.

We have all of us, and then we have, Well, Gold had Gold is with you, and he's proven himself to be a very cute. Oh, yeah. We gotta we gotta get down there and make sure everything's okay. The Sentinels will have to do their best up top. So not a whole lot for it.

I cut out on the sound. Do we have a a sense of where the goblins are coming from? You haven't entered into the battle arena yet. The the the goblins are on the bridge of this of this end temple. They're not coming from the from the hole that we're descending into.

Right? They aren't coming from the hole that you're descending into because they don't appear to be caring about going into the town. They're heading straight for the temple. Yeah. They they seem to, correct me around here what you said earlier, Chris.

They that passive way that got blocked up, that was already down in the, like, hole, they bored through or blew up or somehow they're coming from underground essentially. So Okay. Perfect. Yeah. Okay.

So yeah. Okay. Yeah. That is that is correct. That is the right point.

Alright. It's it's unclear though from your vantage point, which is why I'm being cryptic. You're not actually in the hole. You're not actually staring at the stone wall. You don't know.

You you would assume that they But they are not coming from above ground and getting down in there. No. They have another passageway underground that they're following. Correct. Perfect.

Alright. That simplifies some things Uh-huh. Later. Alright. So you guys head down the, head down the spire to get into the, get into the, temple to be able to face the goblins?

Yep. Mhmm. Mhmm. Okay. Uh-huh.

Alright. So everybody roll initiative. Oh. Oh. Why is it?

It's just like it didn't You got one too. Do it. Holy crap. I don't like those those numbers, Chris. I just saw small humanoid to 97.

I, I'm glad I missed that. Alright. Initiato. Oh, that's fine. This is this is fine.

Sorry. What am I rolling initiative? Yep. I'm gonna get a pass to to your initiative. Alright.

Oh, yep. Modifier. Where did that not? Oh, there it is. Oh, crap.

They couldn't do me better than that. Pretty good. Oh, how do I, I just added a circumstance bonus. How do I get rid of it? Oh, wait.

I'll just turn it off. There we go. I can't I can't mess with that. Okay. Never mind.

Circumstance bonus on There. I think I did it right. I'll do it the long way because I can't do that one. Alright. Here we go.

I did it. I just did it really weird. Right. Wow. That's some phenomenal rolling.

The the avalanche of d twenties. Nice. That's the loud bang we heard. It was the goblins rolling for him. Alright.

Well, on the bright side, they all roll pretty badly. So Yeah. That's good. That's that's that's quite good. Shoot dang.

Where's Cleave? I need Cleave, by the way. A whirlwind strike? What? I'm Yeah.

Pretty sure that champions don't get clean. Yeah. Unless that's silly. That's okay. Because sorcerers do get fireball.

That is true. They better use that. Just not at level two. God. Dang it.

Fancy. That is not what I wanted to hear. Alright. So let's go ahead and get started. Alvar, you are the first.

Yeah. Sure am. Well, far away from do let's turn the volume down on this thing a little bit. Okay. Sick.

That's much better. I'm gonna do the thing that I do best, and we are going to start off make sure I do this right to your next action. Yep. Cool. Cool.

Cool. We're gonna start off by, using a lingering composition. I'm gonna make a performance, which I do have a plus one on. Excellent. That is It's a great role.

Definitely a success. If not It should be. Critical success. So my courageous anthem that I cast next will last four more rounds. Let's see.

I'll place that. Actually, I should move before I do that. Or I just hold on. How does this work? It's just planted on me.

Right? Correct. Okay. Cool. So I'll just put it on my face.

Cool. That's cool. Enter allies. Cool. Alright.

So that was an action. I have used oops. Oops. Oops. Oops.

Don't place another one. Don't do that. Alright. Cool. So that was an action.

Action two let us move a little bit because we're gonna have to do that eventually. We can walk on the air? What's that? We can walk on the air. What do you mean we can go in the air?

Yeah. Let me walk on the air. So are so these are are these here steps down to the bridge? Am I saying that right? Okay.

Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool.

Alright. So, I don't wanna be in people's way. Can I Yeah? I can. So we're gonna ah, shoot.

I forget how to do the thing. But we're gonna move here for twenty and then just go back five feet, to get out of people's way. And then finally, I would like to, recall knowledge of these goblins. That sounds like a good thing to do. And I am going to use my bardic lore because that's what it's here for.

So I will recall knowledge on them, and this counts as the specific lore or whatever it is because bardic lore counts as all lore types. And that is terrible. But that's okay. We'll let that stand. Sorry.

That's my turn. Okay. Okay. Next up, you're here. How far away are they?

Well Do they have a big fireball or something? They're about 55. The closest one is about 55 feet away. I can move 25 at a time or 30? I think depends depends on most of the times, 25.

Yeah. Yours is 25. If you had sudden charge, you'd be able to get to them easy. If I get to them, I can't swing. So what's the point in getting to them?

Not much. You do have a spear that you can chuck, though. Uh-huh. That is fair. You just need to get within 20 feet of them.

25. Again, I think that guy I need 20 feet. Okay. So I can't select him. Go ahead and target target that guy.

Am I automatically, like, raging all that stuff? You are not currently raging, but you should be automatically raging. Yeah. Reply. K.

I don't know how to do the spear thing. Oh, you you need to you need to spend an action to switch out the spear from your great axe. Alright. So you can't move twice. Yeah.

You wouldn't be able to. I'm gonna just go up here and stand in front of Elwar, wait for them to come to us. You could try and demoralize them. Mhmm. So if you go into your basic actions, like the green in in the macro bar, that green button that has two hands shaking, If you go in there, one of the options in there is demoralize.

Here in your character sheet, it's on It's not in the character sheet. It's, on the on the bottom of your screen, you've got, some options that show up in your, in your macro bar down there. Yes. You should see, like, a green button with two hands shaking. No.

I'm looking at first. I've gotta go because you need to select exactly one token to perform demoralize. Do it. I thought I already selected one. I heard blast break.

No. That that was me clicking the button. Do not pay attention to that one. You you do have, you go ahead and just select the one that you've targeted. Just click on it.

K. I'm doing that. And then click on the demoralize. It still won't. Click on your footage.

And then click demoralize. Do it. How would you like to demoralize your tar? Do it. Anything happen?

Let's see. If he tries to demoralize a small humanoid 94 with intimidating glare, he's too far away. It's okay. It's okay. Go to the next one.

I'm waiting for him to come to me. Okay. Next up is this up is gold. He got it. He's gonna lose there.

He's gonna pull out his alone, though. He's gonna do targets. He'll target the straggler over here. Oh, man. He's gonna shoot.

Hit him. Yep. He pigs and goblins. Hey. I got him.

Samir, you're up. Yeah. Sorry. I'm trying to run through stuff and and figure some things out, and I'm I feel like I'm failing miserably. So we have a couple of guys there.

I will I can move 30. How far? 25. Each slot is five feet. Right?

Right. So can I get to Kahir and then take a step back? It looks like that would work for me. Does that get to him and take a step back. I don't know with yeah.

Some of the point setting points. Are you setting points? You could, by clicking x or by pressing x. That'll let you set points. It looks like you can get to, right next to gold.

K. Cool. Thanks. Sorry. Looks good.

You can you can make it there. Okay. So that's one of the actions. I will I'll cast Runic Wend. Will I?

Maybe I will not. So one of my questions here, I I don't remember. Within the the draconic things there, they've got arcane divine occult primal. Right. Is I the arcane?

Is that what I was? No. You you are you are a primal It is primal. Dragon. But your spell list is an arcane spell list because you're a dragon.

Right. Oh, so looking at that flurry of claws, additional damage would type term by the magical tradition. So they're saying that for the primal, it would be fire, which okay. Whatever. Also, something to be noted, you are sick in one, and that condition isn't going to fall off unless you take an action to peek and then make it forward to safe.

Oh, I get to puke and then make it forward to safe. Okay. Yeah. So you have to take an action to puke in order to get a chance to Save the rule of the yeah. Yeah.

Yeah. Okay. Hey. You're gonna be puking. I love it.

Yeah. No. I just think well, we'll just make this a little bit slick right here for you. That's what I'm gonna look at. No.

My, I guess what I'm gonna do right out of the gate is, so I'll I'll target, I think. Right? Mhmm. Target. No.

That's not targeting. Target. There you are. I think I have you targeted. And I will do this.

Am I allowed to do that? Like, I'm I think I'm within a strange. Right? Yeah. Yeah.

Alright. So, Scott, you want me to take the spell effect runic weapon and pull it onto your character sheet or tear hold on to your character. K. So alright. Alright.

And I think that takes care of that's everything I can do. Right? That's Yeah. That it was two actions cast and one action. Cast and one action to to move.

Yep. Okay. Yeah. So You're good. I'll do that.

Alright. It's goblins time. It's goblin. He's gonna move up to the wing here. He's going to target gold because he doesn't like that he just shot his buddy.

So he's gonna need to shoot him back with his short bow. He's gonna miss. He's gonna take another he's gonna notch another arrow and shoot again. This time, he will hit Gald for five points of damage. So goblin runs to the corner, shoots an arrow, it goes wide, pull pulls another one out, shoots again, and hits gald, and it grazes gald on the then this one, these two guys get moved up.

Is going to targets. K. Here, he's going to How far away are they? 45. Shoot.

K. K. Here. From there. Dealing three points of damage, so another arrow comes and grazes, grazes your upper leg.

And then he's going to, he's going to attempt to he's gonna attempt to demoralize, Gulb, but he's also too far away. Morlize is not a range is not a ranged person's game here. Another goblin runs up to the other room, targets Samir, and shoots two arrows. First one misses by two. Mhmm.

Second one hits Samir for five damage. So, you also get a grazing a grazing blow from an arrow. Oh, no. He shot me straight in the shoulder. Oh, that's that's, like, a quarter of his hit point.

Points. Yep. I guess maybe not a grazing blow. I saw it hit in the shoulder. Oh, no.

Might have pierced my lung. Chris, what's your anticipation of this, length of battle time in this? I'm anticipating us stopping, oh, man. Let's let let's let's get to Carson having his turn. So we got two more goblins and then Carson, and then we'll call it for tonight and pick up pick up next time.

Okay? Yep. I want everybody to have a turn at least. Yeah. Yeah.

But I also wanna be appropriate with people's time. So Are you saying if there's nine problem, that might take a minute? Yeah. They're not ninety four. Yeah.

That guy's gonna run up. Oh, he's coming closer. Yeah. We'll see if this demoralize thing works here. Demoralize.

He fails to demoralize, Tahir, but he runs up and basically just, you know, opens his mouth wide and screams in your face as if he was very, very vicious. But you are not you do not fear the goblins. I like your music. And this guy, he went straight up to Cahir, and he's gonna take a, take a whack at him with his dog slicer. And he hits for four points of damage.

The dog slicer cuts into your cuts into your muscular, your muscular chest, but you push it off with your muscles. And now, Arston, you're up. I don't even know if I can get there in time. Maybe one action. How far do I get to move?

25 feet. I'm gonna whack that goblin. Ready? Ready. I'm ready.

Are you ready? You target him? Oh, mother yep. Now I did. Oh, there it is.

Found it. Alright. I how do I get that's gone. Wait. I have status bonuses.

That's oh, yeah. Okay. I get it. Never mind. Oh, they're real.

Oh, yeah. Oh. That is a hit. Sullivan. That's a ridiculous one.

Oh, yeah. I have a I have a yeah. Yeah. Get them. Yep.

So you run up with your sword, got your sword and shield out, and you slice down on the guy that just that just took a slice into, Cahir, and you lob that goblin's head off. Nice. Okay. And now I'm going to put up put up my shield. Oh, yeah.

Well, yeah. You can do it. You have a you have a production. Did I do it? I don't know how I did it.

No. You drew your shield. There's there should be a raise action in there. Oh, there it is. Yep.

There you go. Boom. Alright. Alright. And I will advance the turn marker so that we have everybody worked out, and this is when we'll call it for tonight.

So I like it.
