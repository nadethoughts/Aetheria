 Karsten, As you take the gauntlets, a gust of wind rushes through the chamber. Dust swirls. The air crackles. You blink—and find yourself on a storm-wracked bridge, fire and wind at your command.

#### 🌪️ Karsten (Kekoa the Firebrand – Infernal Breeze Gauntlets)

**Scene:** A storm-wracked bridge over a chasm of fire. Kekoa stands alone, gauntlets glowing with elemental fury.

**Vision:**

> Kekoa turns as Karsten approaches, the wind swirling around them, fire dancing in his eyes.
> 
> **Kekoa:**  
> “You feel it, don’t you? The weight of justice. The fury of fire. The clarity of wind.”
> 
> He raises his fists, then lowers them with reverence.
> 
> **Kekoa:**  
> “I broke armies with these. But I chose peace. Now you must choose—will your strength be a hammer, or a hand? Justice is not vengeance. It is the wind that clears the smoke.”

> The wind dies. The gauntlets cool. your stance is steadier now, as if the storm within you has found its rhythm.
