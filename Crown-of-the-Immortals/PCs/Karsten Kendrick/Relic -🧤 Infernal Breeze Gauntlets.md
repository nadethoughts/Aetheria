## How was it forged?

The gauntlets were forged in the volcanic forges of Emberdeep, where elemental fire and air were bound together in orichalcum. They were cooled in a storm summoned by Kekoa himself, fusing the fury of flame with the clarity of wind. They were not made to destroy—but to judge.

## **The Wind That Judges**  
In the twilight years of the Second Age, when the Llano still whispered through the bones of the world, there rose a warrior whose fury was matched only by his restraint. Kekoa the Firebrand was not born to command, but to protect. He was a La Pelu of paradox—his soul forged in fire, his heart tempered by wind. Where others saw war as conquest, Kekoa saw it as a crucible for justice.

The Infernal Breeze Gauntlets were his legacy. Forged in the divine kilns of Emberdeep, where magma met sky, they were cooled not in water, but in a storm Kekoa summoned with his own breath. The orichalcum was etched with runes of balance—flame for passion, wind for clarity. They were not made to destroy, but to judge. To strike only when the scales of justice demanded it.

Kekoa led the armies of the Veilcant Guard not with banners, but with purpose. At the Battle of Emberdeep, he held the central bridge alone for a full day, his gauntlets a blur of elemental fury. Fire scorched the sky. Wind carved through shadow. But when the battle was won, Kekoa did not celebrate. He walked into a shrine carved in his likeness, placed the gauntlets on the lap of his own statue, and whispered:

> “I broke armies with these. But we break nothing today.”

He turned his back on war, not out of shame, but out of wisdom. He knew that the time for fire would come again—but only when wielded by one who understood its burden.

The gauntlets were sealed in the Temple of Cadens, their power dormant, their judgment withheld. They wait now for a new bearer—not a conqueror, but a protector. One who walks the path of justice not for glory, but for balance. One who knows that true strength lies not in the fist, but in the hand held back.

## 🛡️ The Story of the Last Stand of the Veilcant Guard

At the Battle of Emberdeep, Kekoa held the central bridge alone for a full day. With the gauntlets, he summoned cyclones of fire and wind, holding back the tide of darkness. When the battle was won, he sealed the gauntlets away, choosing peace over power.

## What happens when the character picks up the Relic

When Karsten dons the gauntlets, the air stills, then surges. He feels the weight of judgment and the thrill of justice. The wind whispers his name, and the fire within him steadies. The gauntlets remember his oath—and demand he live up to it.
