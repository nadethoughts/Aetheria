## What

>As you rest, the heat of the day pressing down on you, a memory suddenly floods your mind. You stand atop a stone platform, overlooking a vast battlefield beneath the scorching desert sun. Your armor gleams with golden sigils, and a bastard sword rests firmly in your hand. Below, rows of soldiers await your command—fierce, disciplined, loyal. The scene feels familiar, like a battle you have fought many times before. The strategy, the shifting sands, the enemy's movements—all unfold with clarity, like pieces on a board.
>
>You command with precision, guiding your forces as the wind shapes the dunes. Power resonates in your voice, each word bringing justice with the weight of a mighty general. Victory is not just a hope but an inevitability, and you know you are the architect of it. As the memory fades, the weight of those long-past battles lingers—a reminder of the life you once lived, where kingdoms rose or fell by your hand.
