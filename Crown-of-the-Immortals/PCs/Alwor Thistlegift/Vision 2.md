> Alwor, As your fingers close around the hilt of the Beacon’s Blade, a single note echoes through the chamber—clear, resonant, and impossibly ancient. The blade glows, and the world around you fades into golden light.

#### 🎵 Alwor (Kaleo the Resonant – Beacon’s Blade)

**Scene:** A golden amphitheater under a twilight sky. The wind carries a melody that feels familiar.

**Vision:**

> A figure steps forward—tall, radiant, with a blade of light at his side. Kaleo smiles warmly, his voice like a chord struck in perfect harmony.
> 
> **Kaleo:**  
> “You’ve always had the heart for harmony, Alwor. But now, you must find the courage to lead the chorus. The world is ready to hear the truth—but will you sing it?”
> 
> He draws the Beacon’s Blade and holds it out. It hums in resonance with Alwor’s heartbeat.
> 
> **Kaleo:**  
> “The Llano lives in you. Let it rise. Let it resound. Let it redeem.”
