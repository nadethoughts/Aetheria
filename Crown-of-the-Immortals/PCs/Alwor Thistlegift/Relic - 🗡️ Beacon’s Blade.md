## ✨ Forged in Harmony, Tempered by Betrayal

The Beacon’s Blade was not forged in fire, but in harmony. It was sung into being by Vaerion the Resonant, a La Pelu whose voice could weave the Llano—the Song of Creation—into physical form. Vaerion was not a warrior, but a conductor of divine resonance, a diplomat, and a guardian of balance. His blade was not meant to kill, but to unify, to amplify the voices of others, and to silence the chaos that threatened to unravel the world.

The blade’s obsidian core was drawn from the Singing Mountain of Cadens, a sacred site where the Llano once echoed freely. Its orichalcum wire was braided by Vaerion himself, each strand a note of the First Song, gifted by Raythelion, the Dawnfather, who saw in Vaerion a soul worthy of bearing the light of truth.

But truth, as Vaerion would learn, is fragile.

## 🛡️ The Last Stand of the Veilcant Guard

In the final days of the Second Age, Vorath the Betrayer allied with Syrith the Shadowed and Maldran the Deceiver, turning to Erabose, god of endings, in exchange for power. The war that followed shattered the La Pelu. Only a few remained—Vaerion among them.

To protect the world from another divine war, the survivors formed the Veilcant Guard. They spread lies that the La Pelu were evil, founded the Orders of the Dawnguard and Sentinels of Equilibrium to hunt their own kind, and sealed their relics—fragments of their souls—deep within hidden sanctuaries.

Vaerion sealed the Beacon’s Blade in the Sunken Temple of Cadens, whispering:

> “Let the truth wait for the world to be ready.”

## 🔁 A Blade for the Reborn

Now, in a time of rising darkness, the blade has returned to Alwor—Vaerion reborn. Only a La Pelu can awaken its full power. Only one who remembers the First Song can hear its true voice.

To others, it is a relic.  
To Alwor, it is a memory.  
To the world, it may yet be a beacon.

## 🎵 Alwor’s First Encounter

As Alwor stepped into the mirrored chamber of the Sunken Temple, a single note escaped his lips. The temple responded. A vision overtook him—he stood as Vaerion, robes shimmering with script, driving the blade into the dais. The Llano echoed. The blade vanished.

Back in the present, the blade waited. As Alwor reached for it, it sang—not aloud, but within. The resonance aligned with his heartbeat. The blade recognized him.

> “You are not whole, but you are true. The world is not ready, but you are.”
