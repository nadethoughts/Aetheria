## How was it forged?

Forged not by hammer and flame, but by voice and vision. Kaleo the Resonant sang the blade into being during the First Harmony, weaving strands of the Llano—the Song of Creation—into orichalcum and harmonic wire. It was not merely a weapon, but a conductor of divine resonance.

## **The Song That Led the World**  
In the radiant heart of the Second Age, when the Llano—the Song of Creation—still resonated through the ley-lines of Aetheria, there lived a bard whose voice could still the fury of gods and stir the courage of mortals. His name was Kaleo the Resonant, and he was not merely a singer, but a steward of harmony. Where others wielded blades of steel, Kaleo wielded melody, weaving unity from discord and hope from despair.

The Beacon’s Blade was not forged in fire, but in song. Deep within the Temple of Cadens, Kaleo stood alone in the Hall of Echoes and sang the blade into being. Each note was a strand of the Llano, each verse a vow. The orichalcum core was wrapped in harmonic wire, tuned to the frequencies of the soul. It was not a weapon of war, but a conductor of will—a blade that resonated with the hearts of those who led with purpose.

Kaleo carried the blade into the darkest hours of the War of Fractured Dawn. He did not command armies—he inspired them. His voice rang across battlefields, bolstering the weary and breaking the resolve of the corrupted. At the Shattered Vale, as the Veilcant Guard made their final stand, Kaleo climbed the central spire and sang the Llano aloud. The blade amplified his voice, weaving divine resonance into the very air. The tide turned not with steel, but with song.

When the battle was won and the world teetered on the edge of silence, Kaleo knew the truth: the Llano could not be preserved by memory alone. It had to be hidden, protected, until the world was ready to hear it again. He descended into the Sunken Temple of Cadens, placed the blade into the dais, and whispered:

> “Let the truth wait for the world to be ready.”

The blade fell silent, its song unfinished, its purpose unfulfilled. It was not sealed in fear, but in faith—that one day, a voice would rise to complete the refrain. A voice not of command, but of conviction. A leader not of armies, but of harmony.

The Beacon’s Blade waits still, humming faintly in the deep. It remembers the song. It remembers the sacrifice. And it listens—for the one who will sing again.

## 🛡️ The Story of the Last Stand of the Veilcant Guard

At the Shattered Vale, Kaleo stood atop a spire, singing the Llano aloud as the world cracked beneath him. His voice held the line when steel could not. The blade, glowing with harmonic light, amplified his song across the battlefield, bolstering allies and unraveling the minds of the Shadow Kin. When the battle ended, he sealed the blade away, knowing the world was not yet ready for its truth.

## What happens when the character picks up the Relic

When Alwor first grasped the hilt, the blade hummed—not with steel, but with memory. A note echoed in his mind, one he had never sung but somehow knew. The blade recognized him. It whispered fragments of the Llano, and for a moment, he saw himself not as he was, but as he had been: a leader, a tactician, a voice that moved armies.
