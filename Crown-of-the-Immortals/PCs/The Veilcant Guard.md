_“When all is silent, we are the echo. When all is dark, we are the song.”_

The **Veilcant Guard** was the name once borne by your party in a past life—an elite fellowship of La Pelu, mystics, warriors, and stewards chosen to safeguard the most sacred truth in all of Aetheria: the **Llano**, the Song of Creation.

Formed in the twilight years of the First Age, the Guard was sworn to a singular purpose: to **fracture the Llano**, scattering its verses, melodies, and harmonics across the world in secret repositories, ancient constructs, and mythic vaults. Each fragment was hidden not just in space, but in resonance—requiring heart, memory, and will to retrieve.

The Veilcant Guard did not trust kings, gods, or even themselves with the full truth. Their oath was not to power, but to preservation—so that if ever Aetheria faced annihilation, the true song might be heard again, and used **only by those who remembered why it was hidden**.

The name has long since faded into myth, but echoes remain—in the wind, in ruins, and perhaps... in the blood of those who now walk the world once more.
