## When:
Between the appearance of [[Luakini o ka Manawa]] Temple and the [[Goblin]]'s second major attack on the temple.

## What:
>  The vision seeps into your consciousness like the quiet stirrings of a desert breeze at dawn. You stand at the side of a great chieftain, his presence as solid and enduring as the mountains in the distance. His eyes, sharp and calculating, meet yours for the briefest moment—a silent trust exchanged, deeper than words. You were not just his shaman, but his confidant, bound by the blood of battles fought together, your bond as strong as that of brothers.
>
> Before you, a gathering of tribal elders and emissaries. Tensions run high, the threat of war simmering beneath the surface of their veiled words. You feel the pulse of the earth beneath your feet, the latent magic that thrums through your veins. With the chieftain seated beside you, you speak with measured wisdom, offering both counsel and veiled warning. The words you choose are careful, each one weighted with purpose. You sense their power ripple through the air, a guiding force that calms the storm before it can break.
>
> The chieftain nods subtly, a gesture only you understand—his quiet acknowledgment of your indispensable role. But you know, deep down, that peace may not always be the answer. Should these men fail to see reason, you are prepared to end the conflict swiftly, by other means. The vision fades, leaving behind the lingering weight of responsibility, and the deep bond of trust you once shared with a leader who relied on your wisdom as much as his own strength.
