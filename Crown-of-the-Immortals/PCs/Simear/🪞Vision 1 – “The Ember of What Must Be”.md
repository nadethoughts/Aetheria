_(Read aloud to the player as the vision unfolds)_

> As you rest, the Mirror of Ashes begins to warm in your pack.
> 
> When you draw it out, the surface is no longer reflective—it ripples like water, then ignites with a soft, pulsing flame.
> 
> The world around you fades. The sounds of the swamp vanish. You are no longer here.

> You stand in a clearing deep within the Swamp  
> Red-leafed trees loom overhead, their branches glowing like embers in the dusk.  
> The air is thick with smoke and the scent of bloodroot.

> At the center of the clearing stands a crooked hut, its roof sagging under the weight of moss and bone charms.  
> A massive cauldron bubbles within, glowing with molten light.

> Suspended above the cauldron is Toadwin Greenleaf.  
> Vines of ash and thorn bind him like a puppet.  
> His eyes are closed. His chest rises and falls slowly.  
> He is alive… but not for long.

> A figure stirs from the shadows.  
> Cloaked in tattered robes, her skin cracked like scorched earth, her eyes burning with cruel purpose—

> Velkra.

> Her voice is a rasp, like wind through dead leaves.

> _“The heir’s blood will bind the Ember Key.  
> The seal shall weaken.  
> The Time Turner shall open.  
> And the song shall be silenced.”_

> She raises a dagger of bone and obsidian.  
> The cauldron pulses with dark light.  
> The hut groans, as if the forest itself recoils.

> You feel the mirror tremble in your hand.

> Then, the vision shifts.

> You are no longer in the hut.  
> You are standing in a place of memory—of firelight and silence.

> Before you stands a figure.

> He is tall, robed in ash and gold.  
> His eyes are draconic.  
> His voice is your own, but older. Wiser.

> Rangi the Flame-Seer.

> _“This is not prophecy,”_ he says.  
> _“This is warning.”_

> _“The Ember Key is not yet forged.  
> But the moment is near.”_

> He lifts the Mirror of Ashes and holds it out to you.

> _“You were born of storm and flame.  
> Not to watch, but to act.  
> The mirror shows what may be.  
> But only you can decide what will be.”_

> The vision fades.  
> The mirror cools.  
> The scent of smoke lingers in your nose.

> And you know—Toadwin is alive.  
> But time is running out.
