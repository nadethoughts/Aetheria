> Simear, The mirror’s surface ripples as you lift it. The chamber dims. Embers float in the air. You don't see your reflection, but a memory—your own, and not your own.

#### 🔮 Simear (Rangi the Flame-Seer – Mirror of Ashes)

**Scene:** A darkened sanctum filled with floating embers. Rangi stands before a pool of still water, the mirror in his hand.

**Vision:**

> Rangi turns, his eyes glowing with prophetic fire. The mirror’s surface ripples, showing glimpses of past and future.
> 
> **Rangi:**  
> “You see the world through many eyes, Simear—elf, dragon, mortal, celestial. But now, you must see through time.”
> 
> He holds out the mirror. It reflects a vision of Toadwin bound in a ritual circle.
> 
> **Rangi:**  
> “The past is not a prison. It is a guide. The future is not a promise. It is a choice. Use what you are to become what you must. The world needs your vision.”

> The embers fade. The mirror is still. But Simear’s gaze is sharper now, as if he sees not just what is—but what must be.
