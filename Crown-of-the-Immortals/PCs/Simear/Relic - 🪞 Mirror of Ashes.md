## 🔮 Forged in Reflection, Bound in Flame

The Mirror of Ashes was not crafted by mortal hands, but shaped by memory and fire. It was created by Elenvar the Seer of Embers, a La Pelu oracle whose visions burned through time like wildfire. Elenvar was a truthkeeper, a flame-bearer, and a guardian of forgotten futures. His mirror was not a tool of vanity, but a vessel of revelation—capable of reflecting not just what is, but what was and what may yet be.

The mirror’s surface is obsidian, dark as the void between stars, but when held by one attuned to the Llano, it shimmers with flickers of sapphire and gold. Its frame is orichalcum, etched with runes of remembrance and inlaid with sapphires that pulse with latent foresight.

## 🧠 The Memory That Burns

When Vorath betrayed the La Pelu and the world teetered on the brink of annihilation, Elenvar foresaw the cost of truth. He joined the Veilcant Guard and chose to forget—to seal his visions in the Mirror of Ashes and cast it into the sacred waters of the Sunken Temple of Cadens.

Before he let go, he whispered:

> “Let none see until the world can understand.”

The mirror sank, its surface dimming, its truths buried beneath the waves of time.

## 🔁 A Reflection Reclaimed

Now, the mirror has returned to Simear, the reincarnation of Elenvar. Though he does not yet remember the full weight of his past, the mirror does. It glows faintly in his presence, whispering truths in dreams and flickering with glimpses of what might come.

Only a La Pelu can unlock its full potential. Only one who dares to look into the fire of memory can wield its power without being consumed.

## 🪞 Simear’s First Encounter

In the vault chamber of the Sunken Temple, Simear approached a still basin of water. As he reached in, the surface shimmered, revealing a mirror resting at the bottom. The moment his fingers touched it, the water boiled away in a flash of steam, and the mirror rose into his hands.

A vision overtook him. He stood before the same basin, long ago, whispering truths into the mirror—not in words, but in memories. The mirror darkened, sealing those truths away.

Back in the present, the mirror pulsed with warmth. Its surface shimmered with firelight and reflection. It had waited for him. And now, it remembered.
