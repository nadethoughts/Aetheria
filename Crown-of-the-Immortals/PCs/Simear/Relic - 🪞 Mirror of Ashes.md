## How was it forged?

The Mirror of Ashes was crafted from obsidian drawn from the volcanic heart of Emberdeep and framed in orichalcum etched with draconic and prophetic runes. It was quenched in the sacred pool of prophecy, absorbing echoes of the past and glimpses of the future. It reflects not light, but memory, flame, and fate.

## **The Flame-Seer’s Legacy**  
In the waning years of the Second Age, when the divine harmonies of the Llano still echoed faintly through the ley-lines of Aetheria, there lived a prophet unlike any other. Rangi, known as the Flame-Seer, was born of draconic blood and divine spark. His eyes burned with the fire of foresight, and his voice carried the weight of truths not yet spoken. He was not feared for his power, but revered for his wisdom.

The Mirror of Ashes was his greatest creation—a relic forged from obsidian mined from the volcanic cliffs of Emberdeep, framed in orichalcum etched with runes of memory and flame. It was not a mirror in the traditional sense. It did not reflect the present, but the echoes of what was and the shadows of what might be. Through it, Rangi could see the threads of fate, the rise and fall of empires, the betrayal of gods, and the redemption of mortals.

When the War of Fractured Dawn erupted and the Veilcant Guard rose to defend the Llano, Rangi stood not on the battlefield, but in the sanctums of vision. With the Mirror of Ashes, he guided the Guard through impossible odds—foreseeing ambushes, revealing hidden allies, and unmasking traitors before their blades could strike. His visions saved thousands, and his counsel shaped the final stand at the Shattered Vale.

But Rangi saw more than the war. He saw what would come after—the silence that would follow the song, the rise of a new age, and the long shadow of forgetting. He knew that the truths of the Second Age would be buried beneath the myths of the Third. And so, in the final hours of the war, he brought the mirror to the sacred pool beneath the Temple of Cadens.

There, with the last light of the Second Age flickering on the horizon, he whispered:

> “Let none see until the world can understand.”

He submerged the mirror in the waters of memory, not to hide the truth, but to preserve it. He sealed away the visions of the Second Age—not out of fear, but out of hope. Hope that one day, when the world was ready, the mirror would be found again. That a new seer would rise—not to repeat the past, but to learn from it.

The Mirror of Ashes waits still, its surface dark and silent. But within it burns the memory of a hero who saw the end—and chose to light the way forward.

## 🛡️ The Story of the Last Stand of the Veilcant Guard

As the Veilcant Guard made their final stand, Rangi stood atop the central spire, the mirror in hand. He saw the battle unfold before it began, and the cost it would demand. He chose to seal the mirror, hiding the truths that might shatter hope. His final act was not of fire, but of memory—preserved in silence.

## What happens when the character picks up the Relic

When Simear touches the mirror, it reflects not his face, but his past. He sees himself—Kael’thir—lowering the mirror into the water. The memories return. The truths resurface. The mirror knows him. It had waited. It shows him not what he wants to see, but what he must.
