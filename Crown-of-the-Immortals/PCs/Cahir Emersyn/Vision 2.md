> Cahir, The crown flares with warmth as you lift it. Flames spiral around you. The chamber darkens, and you stand alone on a battlefield of ash.

#### 👑 Cahir (Maleko the Crowned Sentinel – Heart of the Flame)

**Scene:** A battlefield of ash and fire. A lone figure stands atop a scorched wall, a radiant crown blazing on his brow.

**Vision:**

> The flames part, and Maleko steps forward—tall, resolute, his golden crown gleaming like a second sun. His armor is battered, but his eyes burn with unshaken purpose.
> 
> **Maleko:**  
> “You wear the crown now, Cahir. Not for glory. Not for rule. But for the fire that guards the hearth.”
> 
> He removes the crown and holds it out, the metal warm with divine light.
> 
> **Maleko:**  
> “I cast aside my throne to become a shield. Now you must carry that fire forward. Let it burn to protect. Let it light the way when all else falls to shadow.”
