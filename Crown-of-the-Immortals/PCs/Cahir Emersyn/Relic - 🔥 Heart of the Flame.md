## ✨ Forged in Fire, Crowned in Ash

The Heart of the Flame was once a symbol of rulership, not forged in a smithy but drawn from the molten brass of the Sunforge Crucible—a divine kiln tended by the Dawnfather Raythelion himself. It was shaped by Kaelus the Crowned Sentinel, a La Pelu warrior-king who led not with tyranny, but with radiant strength and unwavering resolve.

The circlet was not merely ornamental. It was a conduit of divine fire, a crown that burned away pride and fear alike. Those who wore it were said to feel the weight of every soul they protected—and the heat of every injustice they failed to stop.

## 🛡️ The Last Ember of the Veilcant Guard

When Vorath betrayed the La Pelu and allied with the Shadow Kin, Kaelus stood at the gates of the Dawnspire and held the line as the heavens burned. In the aftermath, he joined the Veilcant Guard, sacrificing his name and legacy to preserve the world.

To ensure the Heart of the Flame would never fall into unworthy hands, Kaelus placed it atop a brass pillar in the Sunken Temple of Cadens. As the molten metal cooled, he whispered:

> “We were kings once. But kings must burn away before light can rise again.”

He turned his back on the crown—and on the truth.

## 🔁 A Crown Reclaimed

Now, the circlet has returned to Cahir, the reincarnation of Kaelus. Though he does not remember the throne he once bore, the fire within him stirs. The Heart of the Flame does not seek obedience—it seeks conviction. Only a La Pelu can awaken its full power. Only one who has burned and endured can wear it without being consumed.

## 🔥 Cahir’s First Encounter

In the mirrored vault of the Sunken Temple, Cahir approached the brass pillar. As he reached out, the metal softened, reshaping itself into a circlet of orichalcum crowned with a single sunstone. The moment he touched it, a vision overtook him.

He stood in a chamber of solar motifs, the circlet in his hands. He placed it on a pedestal of molten brass and whispered:

> “We were kings once. But kings must burn away before light can rise again.”

The vision faded. The circlet pulsed with warmth—not searing, but steady. It did not demand loyalty. It offered purpose.
