> “Let the truth wait for the world to be ready.”

### 🛡️ The Reawakening

Now in Alwor’s hands, the blade resonates with his voice and purpose. It remembers the harmony, the leadership, and the sacrifice.

### 🔥 Memory Sealed in Flame

The Mirror of Ashes was once held by **Rangi the Flame-Seer**, a prophet of the **Veilcant Guard** whose draconic bloodline and divine spark allowed him to see what others could not—echoes of what was, and shadows of what might be. In the final days of the First Harmony, Rangi submerged the mirror in a sacred pool and whispered:

> “Let none see until the world can understand.”

The mirror darkened, sealing away visions too dangerous to be known.

---

### 🛡️ The Reawakening

Now, in the hands of **Simear**, the mirror stirs. In the mirrored chamber of the Sunken Temple, he saw himself—his past self—lowering the mirror into the water. The memories returned. The truths resurfaced. The mirror knew him. It had waited.

To others, it is a relic.  
To Simear, it is a reflection.  
To the world, it may be the key to what was lost—and what must be remembered.
