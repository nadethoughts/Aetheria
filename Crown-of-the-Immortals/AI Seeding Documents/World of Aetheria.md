- **Role**: As a [[La Pelu]], Vorath was tasked with mediating conflicts, guiding rulers, and protecting the innocent. His wisdom and tactical prowess made him a revered figure among the people and his fellow [[La Pelu]].

## The Path to Corruption

- **Ambition**: Over time, Vorath's ambition grew. He began to believe that his superior intellect and strategic mind made him better suited to lead, not just advise.
- **Manipulation**: Vorath started manipulating events and people to his advantage, using his powers to sow discord and mistrust among those he was meant to protect and guide.

## The Great Betrayal

- **Ultimate Scheme**: Vorath's desire for power culminated in a plot to overthrow the leadership of the [[La Pelu]]. He sought to seize control and reshape the order according to his vision.
- **Exposure**: His plan was uncovered by his fellow [[La Pelu]]. A fierce battle ensued, and Vorath, once a beacon of hope, was revealed as a traitor.
- **Corruption**: Defeated but not stripped of his divine spark, Vorath was approached by [[Erabose]], the dark god. Seizing the opportunity, [[Erabose]] corrupted Vorath, twisting his divine powers for malevolent purposes.

## Transformation and Exile

- **Exile**: Banished from the Blessed Realm, Vorath wandered the lands, his once-noble visage now marred by the weight of his treachery.
- **Corrupted Purpose**: Embracing his new identity as the Betrayer, Vorath became a figure of fear and loathing. His presence brought distrust and paranoia wherever he went. Now serving his own dark purposes and those of Erabose, he used his powers to further chaos and destruction.

## Legacy and Impact

### Fear and Mistrust of [[La Pelu]]

- **Legacy of Betrayal**: Vorath's actions had far-reaching consequences, leading to widespread fear and mistrust of[[La Pelu]]. His betrayal was seen as proof that even those granted divine power by [[Raythelion]] could fall victim to corruption.
- **Cultural Impact**: In many regions, [[La Pelu]] are now viewed with suspicion and fear. People are wary of their motives, always questioning whether they might follow in Vorath's footsteps.

### Lasting Influence

- **Symbol of Betrayal**: Vorath's name became synonymous with betrayal and deceit. His story is told as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked ambition and the corrupting influence of power.
- **Impact on La-Pelu**: His betrayal led to stricter oversight and skepticism toward new [[La Pelu]]. The once-revered protectors are now often met with suspicion, their intentions constantly questioned.

## Final Notes

- **Myth and Reality**: Over time, Vorath's story has taken on a mythic quality. Some see him as a tragic figure, a cautionary tale about the dangers of ambition. Others view him as a monstrous villain, a reminder of the potential for darkness within even the brightest souls.
- **Continued Influence**: Despite his downfall, Vorath's legacy continues to shape the world. His story is a stark reminder of the fragile nature of trust and the devastating impact of betrayal.
- **La-Pelu's Burden**: The tale of Vorath is a constant reminder to all [[La Pelu]] of the heavy burden they bear. They must guard against corruption and strive to remain true to their purpose, lest they too fall from grace.

# The Flaming Retribution

![[flaming-retrobution.webp]]

- **Event Name**: The Flaming Retribution
- **Date**: Approximately one year before the current timeline
- **Location**: Continent of [[Solaris]], primarily affecting [[The Blessed Realm]]
- **Type**: Cataclysmic Event
- **Description**: The Flaming Retribution was a devastating event that brought meteors, flaming debris, and boiling geysers upon [[The Blessed Realm]] and other parts of [[Solaris]], leading to widespread destruction and the collapse of the once-great kingdom.

## **Cause**

### **Divine Prophecy**
- **Prophetic Warnings**: The prophets of [[Raythelion]], the god worshiped by the Blessed Realm, had foretold the impending doom. They warned the inhabitants of the Blessed Realm to repent and change their ways, but their warnings were largely ignored.
- **Divine Judgement**: The Flaming Retribution was believed to be a divine punishment from [[Raythelion]] for the hubris, corruption, and moral decline of [[The Blessed Realm]]. The kingdom had turned from their ways of enlightenment and guidance to oppression and conquest.

# **Events**
## The War of Fractured Dawn

### The Sundering of Light

In the twilight of the Second Age, the world of [[Aetheria]] flourished under the guidance of the [[La Pelu]]—divine champions of [[Raythelion]], the Dawnfather. These radiant beings were not merely warriors, but stewards of harmony. They upheld peace, nurtured growth, and served as living conduits of divine will.

But peace is fragile.

[[Vorath the Betrayer]], once a La Pelu of great renown, fell to the whispers of [[Erabose]], the Sovereign of Shadows. Alongside [[Syrith the Shadowed]] and [[Maldran the Deceiver]], he turned against Raythelion and embraced corruption. In exchange for power, they became the first of the [[Shadow Kin]], and the divine order fractured.

The war that followed shattered the La Pelu. Elemental forces raged. Cities burned. Temples fell. The world teetered on the brink of annihilation.

### The Radiant Accord

In the chaos that followed, four La Pelu remained uncorrupted. They were:

- [[Kaleo the Resonant]], bard and diplomat, wielder of the [[Beacon’s Blade]]
- [[Thandor the Crowned Sentinel]], warrior-king, bearer of the [[Heart of the Flame]]
- [[Kaelion the Firebrand]], general and tactician, wearer of the [[Infernal Breeze Gauntlets]]
- [[Seraphir the Flame-Seer]], oracle and keeper of the [[Mirror of Ashes]]

Together, they formed the [[Veilcant Guard]], a secretive order sworn to protect the [[Llano]], the Song of Creation. They rallied mortals, elemental spirits, and surviving divine allies into a coalition known as the [[Radiant Accord]].

But for every victory, the Shadow Kin claimed two more. [[Syrith]] sowed paranoia. [[Maldran]] corrupted bloodlines. [[Vorath]] remained hidden, his will carried by monstrous avatars and whispered dreams.

### The Battle of Emberdeep

The first major clash came at the volcanic forge-temple of [[Emberdeep]], where Vorath sought to corrupt the elemental forges and create the [[Unmaker’s Brand]]—a weapon capable of severing divine essence.

The Veilcant Guard stood in defense:

- [[Kaelion the Firebrand]] held the central bridge alone for a full day.
- [[Kaleo the Resonant]] calmed the forge-spirits with the Canticle of Binding.
- [[Thalara of the Emberkin]], a mortal smith-priestess, shattered the half-forged Brand with her life.

The Accord held the forge, but the cost was immense. The forge was sealed, and the war dragged on.

### The Turning of the Flame

The war reached its crescendo at the [[Shattered Vale]], where the ley-lines of the world converged and the Llano still resonated in full.

The Veilcant Guard led the final charge:

- [[Thandor the Crowned Sentinel]] held the line against Vorath’s vanguard.
- [[Kaelion the Firebrand]] led the mortal legions.
- [[Seraphir the Flame-Seer]] stood atop the central spire, channeling visions of what must come.
- [[Kaleo the Resonant]] sang the Llano aloud, weaving divine resonance into the battlefield.

The Shadow Kin were broken. Vorath was cast down. But the Llano was now vulnerable.

In the aftermath, the Guard made a pact:

- The Llano would be fractured, its verses hidden across [[Aetheria]].
- The truth of the war would be veiled, to protect future generations.
- Their relics would be sealed in the desert temple of [[Cadens]], known in the old tongue as [[Luakini o le Pese]].

Each relic was bound with a fragment of its bearer’s soul.

### Aftermath: The Age of Silence

To prevent another divine war, the Veilcant Guard founded two knightly orders:

- The [[Order of the Dawnguard]] – protectors of justice and hunters of divine corruption.
- The [[Sentinels of Equilibrium]] – guardians of balance and neutrality.

The world forgot the truth. The La Pelu became feared. The Llano became myth.

The [[Sunken Temple of Cadens]], buried beneath the sands and later submerged beneath the [[Blessed Realm]], became the resting place of the four relics:

- The [[Beacon’s Blade]]
- The [[Heart of the Flame]]
- The [[Mirror of Ashes]]
- The [[Infernal Breeze Gauntlets]]

The Veilcant Guard vanished. Their names faded into legend.

But the flame was never extinguished.

### Prophecy of the Echoing Flame

> “When the flame is fractured and the song is sealed,  
> When kings cast down their crowns and the wind forgets its name,  
> Four shall rise, not as they were, but as they must be.  
> The blade shall sing, the crown shall burn, the mirror shall weep, and the gauntlets shall bind.  
> In the shadow of the Unmaker’s breath, the world shall tremble.  
> Only those who remember why they forgot shall find the path.  
> Only those who sing the silence shall awaken the dawn.”

## Flaming Retribution
### **Meteor Shower**
- **Meteors and Debris**: The event began with a shower of meteors and flaming debris falling from the sky, causing massive fires and widespread destruction across the land.
- **Impact Sites**: Major cities, including [[Lumopolis]], were heavily impacted. Buildings were reduced to rubble, and entire regions were set ablaze.

### **Boiling Geysers**
- **Eruptions**: The ground itself erupted with boiling geysers, spewing scalding water and steam, further devastating the land and adding to the chaos.
- **New Terrain**: These eruptions altered the geography of the land, creating craters filled with boiling water and transforming once-fertile areas into steaming marshlands.

### **Consequences**

- **Collapse**: [[The Blessed Realm]], once a powerful and prosperous kingdom, was utterly destroyed. Its cities lay in ruins, and its population was decimated.
- **Loss of Knowledge and Culture**: Much of the kingdom's knowledge, culture, and history was lost in the destruction. Libraries, temples, and cultural artifacts were consumed by the flames and chaos.

#### **Survivors**
- **Exodus**: Those who heeded the prophets' warnings and managed to escape the initial devastation fled north, away from the worst of the destruction. They formed new communities, struggling to survive in the aftermath.
- **Remnants**: The surviving inhabitants of [[The Blessed Realm]] now live in scattered settlements, holding onto the remnants of their culture and striving to rebuild.

#### **Environmental Impact**
- **Altered Landscape**: The land that was once [[The Blessed Realm]] is now a collection of craters, boiling lakes, and steaming marshes. The fertile plains and rolling hills have been transformed into a harsh and inhospitable environment.
- **Climate Change**: The Flaming Retribution caused significant changes in the local climate, with increased volcanic activity and ash clouds affecting weather patterns.

#### **New Beginnings**
- **Rebuilding**: The survivors of the Flaming Retribution are determined to rebuild and create a new society. They carry with them the lessons learned from their ancestors' mistakes, striving to avoid repeating the same errors.
- **Hope and Renewal**: The aftermath of the Flaming Retribution, while devastating, also represents an opportunity for renewal and growth. The survivors see it as a chance to forge a new path, guided by the principles of [[Raythelion]] and the lessons of the past.


# Factions
### **The Namar'Zul – Seekers of the Divine Trail**
- **“Namar”** = _Path / Journey / Migration_
- **“Zul”** = _Mire / Swamp / New Land_

The **Namar'Zul** are a nomadic tribe of [[Tripkee]] bound to the divine calling of **[[Uhlvara]]**, the Seeker in the Wilds. Known for their relentless pursuit of elusive prey and hidden truths, the Namar'Zul wander the shifting lands and seas of [[Aetheria]], ever guided by the glimmer of [[The Rank of Guiding Luminecence|the Guiding Luminescence]]. Unlike other [[Tripkee]] tribes, they do not make their homes in marshes or hollowed trees, but instead atop the shell of a **titanic sea turtle** known as **[[Oloru]]**, the Shellborn Sentinel.

Gifted to the Namar'Zul by [[Uhlvara]] himself generations ago, **[[Oloru]]** is a living sanctuary and symbol of divine favor. His back bears a mossy forest, herbal gardens, and homes crafted from bone and driftwood. It is said his eyes reflect the stars of every sky he has seen, and he knows the paths through hidden currents and ancient ley lines lost to time.

The Namar'Zul escaped the horrors of the [[Flaming Retribution]] by mere fate, as [[Oloru]] glided through safer seas. Now, they reside in a **volatile swamp**, its waters near boiling, brimming with elemental danger and dark corruption. Here, they face off against **giant flora and insects**, the **twisted [[Goblin#Fire Walker Tribe|Firewalker Tribe]]** and their **hag mistresses**, the monstrous **[[Grul’Mog the Deep Belly (Froghemoth)]]**, and roaming **undead spirits** displaced from ruined [[Lumopolis]].

Yet the Namar'Zul endure, living not in fear but in purpose. To them, every threat is a signpost on the divine trail — a challenge set by [[Uhlvara]] to guide them toward a greater revelation.

# [[Solaris Sentinels]]
![[solaris-sentinels.webp]]

The Solaris Sentinels were a secret sect within [[The Order of The Blessed Realm]], operating as highly trained and devoted champions for the protection of the order and the community against evil forces. 

Originally established as a paladin sect, the Solaris Sentinels were renowned for their discipline, dedication, and martial prowess. They were tasked with safeguarding the order's interests and upholding its ideals in the face of adversity.

However, with the destruction of [[The Blessed Realm]] and the onset of the [[Flaming Retribution]], the fate of the Solaris Sentinels remains uncertain. It is likely that the once-venerated organization has been disbanded or decimated, its members scattered or lost in the chaos that engulfed [[Solaris]].

#[[Order-of-the-High-Sun]]
![[Order-of-the-Blessed-realm.webp]]

The Order of the Blessed Realm was a once-prominent organization in the Sun Kingdom, known for being the bringers of enlightenment. Originally migrating from the south, they shared advancements in agriculture, technology, and the ways of true magic with the people of Solaris.

Over time, however, the Order began to impose lordship over the free peoples of Solaris rather than acting as peaceful guides. They abandoned their old ways and started practicing new forms of worship. Prophets of Raythelion foretold of impending doom, but the inhabitants ignored the warnings and punished the mouthpieces of the great god Raythelion, leading to their downfall.

The Order's stronghold, the Blessed Kingdom, was destroyed by the Flaming Retribution, a catastrophic event that left the once-great kingdom in ruins. With the destruction of the Blessed Realm, the Order ceased to exist, becoming a relic of the past.

## **Oloru, the Shellborn Sentinel**

**Oloru** is a colossal sea turtle, ancient beyond reckoning, and a sacred gift from **[[Uhlvara]], the Seeker in the Wilds**. He is both sanctuary and guardian to the **[[Namar'Zul]]**, bearing their people on his mossy, forested shell as he travels the waters and skies of [[Aetheria]]. His slow movements conceal deep wisdom and immense power, and though he is at home beneath the waves, **when the world needs him most — he flies**.

---

### **The Wings of the Hunt**

Legends speak of the moment during the **[[Flaming Retribution]]** when fire rained from the heavens and the seas boiled. The [[Tripkee]] cried out to [[Uhlvara]] — and Oloru answered.

With a deep, thunderous bellow that split the storm, Oloru's limbs shimmered with celestial light. Massive, glowing **fins expanded like wings**, unfurling from his body with the grace of an eclipse. Lifting into the air, **he soared**, bearing the [[Namar'Zul]] out of the dying sea and into the sheltering arms of the sky.

Since that day, the [[Namar'Zul]] revere his **Flightform** as a holy mystery — a hidden power awakened only in dire times, when fate itself turns against them.

### **Traits and Divine Abilities (Flavorful)**

- **Flightform (Divine Gift):** Oloru can call upon [[Uhlvara]]’s blessing to take to the skies. In this state, his fins glow with radiant energy, and he leaves behind a trail of stardust and sea mist. He only flies when threatened, or when following signs from [[Uhlvara]].
- **Sky-and-Sea Bond:** Oloru feels the pulse of both ocean and air currents. His instincts lead him to places of power, danger, or destiny — an extension of [[Uhlvara]]’s domain.
- **Shelled Worldwalker:** As he soars, the [[Namar'Zul]] see a vision of a world untouched by shadow — a glimpse of the Hunt’s truest path.

![[La Pelu Raythelion-logo-1.webp]]
or in the common language ***Sun Swords***

In the realm shaped by the divine [[Raythelion]] a La-Pelu is an individual marked by destiny to embody the celestial will on [[Aetheria]]. These enigmatic beings emerge only during epochs of dire crisis, serving as the reincarnated champions of lore. The method of their selection remains a mystery—whether they are born anew with the soul of a past hero or chosen for their kindred spirit. It is widely held that the spirits of former La-Pelu dwell within their successors, offering counsel and support without seizing control. Once anointed by [[Raythelion]]’s light, a La-Pelu’s fate is irrevocably sealed, their path unalterable by any deed.

In the modern Culture however, they are thought to be servants of [[Erabose]] with hidden agendas of destruction, due to a time of fear and destruction, 400 years ago in which many of the Sun Swords ([[La Pelu]]) were corrupted and made to be servants of [[Erabose]]. This brought to an end the Golden Age of [[The Blessed Realm]] and in order to save the world, they were forced to put all the [[La Pelu]] to the sword. Rather than risk another time of darkness, [[The Blessed Realm]] created Systems and Knights orders to destroy any Sun Swords who appear before they become too powerful to defeat.

La-Pelu are feared as harbingers of ruin, their intentions mistrusted due to the infamy of recent bearers whose very names— [[Maldran the Deceiver]], [[Syrith the Shadowed]], and [[Vorath the Betrayer]] —evoke terror in the common folk. This grim legacy compels the nascent La-Pelu to tread with utmost caution, concealing their true nature from all but the most trusted confidants, lest they face societal exile or, worse, the relentless pursuit of their demise. Two venerable orders of knights, [[The Order of the Dawnguard]]and [[The Sentinels of Equilibrium]], have arisen to purge this perceived threat. For a La-Pelu, existence is akin to balancing upon the razor’s edge.

## Game Statistics 
### **Sign of the Sun**
The character calls upon their connection with [[Raythelion]], igniting an inner sun. Their skin begins to glow like a lampshade, and an aura resembling flickering flames moves up and down their body. This aura eventually takes the shape of an animal that represents their inner self, a unique trait that unmistakably identifies them as a La-Pelu.

Activating this ability takes one action and causes the character to shed light in a 20-foot radius for 10 minutes. This effect cannot be removed or dispelled before the time limit ends. While this ability is active, the character gains resistance to spirit damage equal to half their level, rounded down.

When a La-Pelu uses an innate spell granted by their La-Pelu Nature or a Sun's Blessing ability, a lesser version of this phenomenon occurs. They glow faintly, and a silhouette of their aura appears. Although this glow is not bright enough to read by, it unmistakably marks them as a La-Pelu. As they use more abilities, the aura's intensity increases, making battles involving La-Pelu a spectacular sight.

### **Brilliant Toughness**
La-Pelu are tougher than a typical creature of their class and heritage. La-Pelu increase their max HP by 3 for each level they possess.

### **Enlightened Skills**
La-Pelu catch on to abilities quicker than your average person. Every time your class would grant you a skill feat, you get +1 Skill Feat. (If you are a Rogue this is every level, if you are anything else, it is every even level)

### **Innate Spells** *(Mystic Armor, Radiant Beam and Sunburst)*
A La-Pelu can channel the power of [[Raythelion]], gaining access to cleric spells granted by [[Raythelion]]. They can use these spells once per day as innate abilities. These innate spells are automatically heightened based on the La-Pelu's level and the corresponding spell rank, even if the character is not a spellcaster.

### **Ancestry Paragon**
All La-Pelu automatically have the ***Ancestral Paragon Variant Rule*** Applied

### **Sun's Blessing**
La-Pelu possess unique supernatural powers that grow stronger over time and become signature abilities for each individual. At 1st level, the character can choose one Deviant Ability Feat and adapt it to fit a sun theme. This ability will become even more powerful at 4th & 10th level.

### ***Level progression***
| level | Ability |
|------|-------|
|1 | Mystic Armor (Innate Spell), Sign of the Sun, Brilliant Toughness, Enlightened Skills, Ancestry Paragon (2 Ancestory Feats)|

_“When all is silent, we are the echo. When all is dark, we are the song.”_

The **Veilcant Guard** was the name once borne by your party in a past life—an elite fellowship of La Pelu, mystics, warriors, and stewards chosen to safeguard the most sacred truth in all of Aetheria: the **Llano**, the Song of Creation.

Formed in the twilight years of the First Age, the Guard was sworn to a singular purpose: to **fracture the Llano**, scattering its verses, melodies, and harmonics across the world in secret repositories, ancient constructs, and mythic vaults. Each fragment was hidden not just in space, but in resonance—requiring heart, memory, and will to retrieve.

The Veilcant Guard did not trust kings, gods, or even themselves with the full truth. Their oath was not to power, but to preservation—so that if ever Aetheria faced annihilation, the true song might be heard again, and used **only by those who remembered why it was hidden**.

The name has long since faded into myth, but echoes remain—in the wind, in ruins, and perhaps... in the blood of those who now walk the world once more.
