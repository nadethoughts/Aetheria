# ⚔️ The War with Vorath

## 🌅 The Golden Age and the Rise of the La Pelu

In the Second Age of Aetheria, the world flourished under the guidance of the La Pelu—divine champions of Raythelion, the Dawnfather. These radiant beings were not merely warriors, but stewards of harmony. They upheld peace, nurtured growth, and served as living conduits of divine will.

## 🕳️ The Betrayal and the Fall

But peace is fragile.

Vorath, once a La Pelu of great renown, fell to the whispers of Erabose, the Sovereign of Shadows. Alongside Syrith the Shadowed and Maldran the Deceiver  (The Shadow Kin), he turned against Raythelion and allied with Erabose. In exchange for power, they embraced corruption, and the divine order fractured.

The war that followed shattered the La Pelu. Cities burned. Temples fell. Solaris, The countries and cities burned. The conflict threatened to destroy all of Aetheria. The world teetered on the brink of annihilation.

## 🛡️ The Veilcant Guard and the Sealing of Truth

In the aftermath, a handful of La Pelu survived. Among them were:

- Kaleo the Resonant, bard and diplomat, who wielded the Beacon’s Blade.
- **Kaelus the Crowned Sentinel**, warrior-king and bearer of the Heart of the Flame.
- **Kaelion the Firebrand**, General of the Veilcant Guard and wearer of Infernal Breeze Gauntlets
- **Kael’thir the Flame-Seer**, oracle and keeper of the Mirror of Ashes.

These survivors formed the **Veilcant Guard**, a secretive order that chose to veil the truth to protect the world from another divine war. They:

- Spread lies that the La Pelu were evil.
- Founded the Orders of the Dawnguard and Sentinels of Equilibrium to hunt their own kind.
- Sealed their relics—fragments of their divine essence—within hidden sanctuaries.

Each relic was hidden with a vow:

- “Let the truth wait for the world to be ready.” —Kaleo
- “We were kings once. But kings must burn away before light can rise again.” —Kaelus
- “I broke armies with these. But we break nothing today.” -- Kaelion
- “Let none see until the world can understand.” —Kael’thir

## 🧟‍♂️ The Return of the Betrayer

Now, in the Age of Decay, Vorath stirs once more.

Clues uncovered by the party reveal:

- Goblins and underdark creatures are digging toward the **Ruins of Kuth’Alar**, Vorath’s resting place.
- A **Cryptic Prayer Scroll** speaks of serving “The Betrayer” in the shadows beneath the Broken Tower.
- A **Whispering Skull** warns: “The sands of time shall turn again… the Betrayer will rise, and the flame shall be snuffed out.”
- **Rangiained Goblin Runes** call him “The Unmaker of Ages,” who seeks to return the world to a time before flame.

The goblins, manipulated by Vorath’s agents and the Hag Velkra, seek to use the **Great Time Turner** to undo the Flaming Retribution and restore Vorath’s dominion.

## 🔥 Legacy and Rebirth

The player characters are reincarnations of the Veilcant Guard. Their relics—Beacon’s Blade, Heart of the Flame, Mirror of Ashes, and Infernal Breeze Gauntlets—are awakening. Their visions recall the war, the sacrifices made, and the truths buried.

They must now decide:

- Will they reveal the truth of the La Pelu?
- Will they stop Vorath’s return?
- Will they restore the Llano and the balance of creation?

The war is not over. It is beginning again.
