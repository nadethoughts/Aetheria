# Into the Temple

## Location: [[Luakini o ka Manawa]]

### **Starting Location**
Starting Town

# Preamble
* Don't forget your Hero points!!
* Clairifications of the world
	* Being [[La Pelu]] is viewed similarly to someone on the real world being Demon possessed and all of you know this.
	* Different cultures regardless will view La Pelu as evil. Doesn't matter were you come from what race you are a part of. No one knows that they are Raythelion's Chosen and those that do generally consider them to be a test or a trial of Raythelion, not a blessing.
* About half of you were perfectly happy to be here, but there were some requests for more RP and more combat.
* This adventure was designed to throw your character into a situation that they are uncomfortable and use the adversity to bond you together. I am not specifically seeing that in the responses that I got from the questionnaire, so I will definitely need do more to get your characters to mesh as a team and would appreciate your cooperation.

## Answers to questions
1. ***What are your character's next steps?***
	1. **[[Cahir]]** - See sister to discuss what is happening. Talk to town leaders and hone skills
	2. **[[Karsten]]** - Healing up, selling the booty and purchasing anything new. Then focusing on the next question.
	3. **[[Simear]]** - I think he would find a way to isolate himself, take time to get his head wrapped around what is/has been going on, and practice working with/using/controlling the new abilities. He would also be willing to fall back into some of his crafting work. (I think this is a time to have him working to develop some of the new feats he has chosen, since many of these would not have an in story context for there development.)
	4. **[[Alwor]]** - Honestly, he's not sure. He's quite thrown by the events in the temple, but taking it as the purpose for which he was saved from the calamity. He's feeling empowered as a call to adventure but unsure exactly where to go / what to do with it.
2. ***In the time gap between the end of this adventure to the beginning of the next one, what is your character doing?***
	1. **[[Cahir]]** - Hone skills as blacksmith. Make or buy spears and practice. Discuss with town leadership to plan to watch for wickedness around the area.
	2. **[[Karsten]]** - exploring all the things that just happen. Researching how to repair the hour glass. Looking for leads to find the goblin hideout. Going into the cave and studying the temple. Helping people who need it. with in the village.
	3. **[[Alwor]]** - He would be continuing his role in the town, and looking for ways to help that may be more dangerous then usual. In his downtime, he would be trying to hone his skills and practice with his new found abilities.
3. ***How is your character dealing with his new abilities? La-Pelu are known for being evil and committing evil deeds in society. Most people consider them to be the boogie man.*** ![[hide_powers_chart.jpg]]]
	1. **[[Cahir]]** - No need to hide my strength
	2. **[[Karsten]]** - I am keeping it under wraps until I get a better understanding of what this means as a character. I wouldn't be showing them off. I would try to act as I did before the temple arriving.
	3. **[[Simear]]** - I feel like this is not something that would have happened often in the context of the elven society or that perhaps the reputation would be somewhat different. As a result, I don't think Simear would have much of a grid for this. Much like some of his draconic features, he would find trying to hide some traits unnecessary. And like some of his past with magic, he would find some of these traits better left undisclosed to the public.
	4. **[[Alwor]]** - It would depend a bit on how this particular town views them and how we could discuss it with them. By nature of the towns existence, they are more open to the gods and to Raythelion, and may be more open to these powers once they understand where they really come from. But if it would put him in danger with the town, he would try to hide them.
