- [x] [[Goblin#Fire Walker Tribe|Fire Walker Tribe]] attacks: If they want to kill Goblins, then they can wait around for a bit, as [[Oloru]] is quite often attacked by the Goblins. ((The [[Tripkee]] don't know why, but the reason is due to the [[Sunken Temple]]. [[Oloru]] is resting right on top of it and The [[Namar'Zul]] just happen to be in the way.))
- [x]  [[Alwor]] notices a Tapestry that is being used as a blanket for an elderly [[Tripkee]]. (Wobalu) The Tapestry is part of the story of the creation of [[Aetheria]]. What caught his eye is the story is referencing the use of music in the creation story ([[Llano]]).

The group where once friends in a previous life as [[La Pelu]] and they made a pact of protection for the [[Llano]]. They called themselves [[The Veilcant Guard]] and one of the places that they hid bars of the Song of Creation was the [[Sunken Temple]].

This temple was buried and hidden for such a time as the Song was needed once more.

### Flashbacks IP
**Flashback: Alwor – The Beacon’s Blade**

The air was thick with salt and metal as Alwor, clad in robes etched with shimmering script, stood at the base of the temple’s central pillar. His voice hummed with the final notes of the Llano, a harmony so perfect it made the air vibrate. As he drove his blade into the stone dais—an obsidian weapon wrapped in golden wire and humming with stored resonance—he murmured, _“Let the truth wait for the world to be ready.”_ The blade vanished into the stone, sealing with it the memory of his judgment and sacrifice.

**Flashback: Cahir – The Heart of the Flame**

In a chamber filled with carved solar motifs, Cahir removed the circlet from his brow—once a symbol of his rulership—and set it upon a pedestal of molten brass. “We were kings once,” he whispered to no one, “but kings must burn away before light can rise again.” As the circlet sank into the metal, the flame within dimmed. He stood for a long time, not as a king, but as a sentinel, and turned his back on the past.

**Flashback: Karsten – The Bound Gauntlet**

Lightning split across the sky beyond the cracked ceiling of the hall. Karsten’s gauntlet, etched with runes that once bent the wind to his will, lay across the lap of a statue shaped in his image. “I broke armies with this,” he said, “but we break nothing today.” He pressed his hand to the statue’s chest, whispering a single line of the Llano that bound the artifact in stasis. The wind fell still, unnaturally still.

**Flashback: Simear – The Mirror of Ashes**

Before the temple’s mirrored pool, Simear held a small obsidian mirror, its surface already dimming. He whispered to it, not in words, but in truths: _who they were, what they had lost, and what must be forgotten._ The mirror shimmered and then darkened as if swallowing the memories whole. He placed it beneath the water. “Let none see until the world can understand.”

# Session Notes
Upon arriving at Oloru (A giant sea turtle that the [[Namar'Zul]] live on) the party met [[Chief Croakmar Greenleaf]] and his wife [[Lady Lilypad Greenleaf]] and daughter [[Frorella Greenleaf]]. They are the family of [[Prince Troubadour]]. Being that they brought [[Prince Troubadour]] with them, unharmed and safe, the party was welcomed generously. They were feasted with all manner of types of food from all over the world. 

After the feast they met with [[Chief Croakmar Greenleaf]] About what’s been happening. The party explained that the fire Walker tribe has been attacking their village and They have been asked by their superiors to take out the threat. 

Chief Cromar informed them that they have been fighting the fire Walker tribe for sometime. They don’t know how to locate the fire walkers due to some sort of magic that is causing them to be unable to find their encampment. Either the scouting parties Get turned around or they are never seen from again. He is happy to assist the group in finding and destroying the fire walkers, but must wait until His eldest son returns. 

In the meantime, they will interrogate the goblin prisoner that the Party brought them to see if they can clean some knowledge from this goblin. 

The threat of a goblin incursion is significant. Goblin‘s attack on a very regular basis.

While they were waiting over, decides that he wants to have a conversation with all the giant turtle. In asking the giant turtle, he gets the story of all the room being in existence prior to the creation of the sea. That he was a constant companion of Alvira and a close friend. The truck keys did Ovara a great service that gave them the honor of Being protected and watched over by Alvaro.

Overall reviews that the Lablue are actually divine beings and most were good. Those that were turned to evil or corrupted by Arvo himself. The power that they wheeled was turned for evil and that is why the world fears them now, but it was not always so.

They also find out that there is a temple of cadence that is underneath the lake and surrounded by brine sharks. Now they have to figure out a way of making it to the temple because it is believed that a piece of the line exist inside that temple

When they return to the shell of [[Oloru]], [[Cahir]] meets with [[Frorella Greenleaf]] To ask after[[Toadwin Greenleaf]] And discover the family dynamic. He finds that while the rest of the family considers [[Prince Troubadour]] A bit odd they love him and appreciate his abilities. [[Toadwin Greenleaf]] He’s a great Hunter and tracker, and there is some concern about him not having returned yet. This is especially the case since being that he is such a great tracker the party should have run into him on their way back. He’s recognized as a humble and capable leader, and he doesn’t have any power hungry grab for the throne blood thirst in him. 

[[Cahir]] Has a plan of reverse engineering, a fire resistance potion. He came up with three different solutions.
1. Diluted so that it will only produce fire resistance for 15 minutes, but be able to be split four ways
2. Make it so it is a oil that they can put on fabric in grant fire resistance on a wetsuit style situation, but every 10 points of damage that they take reduces the fire resistance of the wetsuit by one
3. Make a fire resistant submersible

Now the group has to figure out what to do next
