### Information
- [ ] Location of the [[Goblin#Fire Walker Tribe|Fire Walker Tribe]]: The [[Namar'Zul]] know the general location of the [[Goblin#Fire Walker Tribe|Fire Walker Tribe]] but not the specific location. Every time a raiding party goes in the general direction, they either get confused and return or are never seen from again.
- [ ] [[Goblin#Fire Walker Tribe|Fire Walker Tribe]] attacks: If they want to kill Goblins, then they can wait around for a bit, as [[Oloru]] is quite often attacked by the Goblins. ((The [[Tripkee]] don't know why, but the reason is due to the [[Sunken Temple]]. [[Oloru]] is resting right on top of it and The [[Namar'Zul]] just happen to be in the way.))
- [ ]  [[Alwor]] notices a Tapestry that is being used as a blanket for an elderly [[Tripkee]]. (Wobalu) The Tapestry is part of the story of the creation of [[Aetheria]]. What caught his eye is the story is referencing the use of music in the creation story ([[Llano]]).

## [[Sunken Temple]]
### Scenario
The [[Sunken Temple]] is an old temple of [[Cadens]] as well as a resting place for some artifacts. The group where once friends in a previous life as [[La Pelu]] and they made a pact of protection for the [[Llano]]. They called themselves [[The Veilcant Guard]] and one of the places that they hid bars of the Song of Creation was the [[Sunken Temple]].

This temple was buried and hidden for such a time as the Song was needed once more.

### Flashbacks IP
**Flashback: Alwor – The Beacon’s Blade**

The air was thick with salt and metal as Alwor, clad in robes etched with shimmering script, stood at the base of the temple’s central pillar. His voice hummed with the final notes of the Llano, a harmony so perfect it made the air vibrate. As he drove his blade into the stone dais—an obsidian weapon wrapped in golden wire and humming with stored resonance—he murmured, _“Let the truth wait for the world to be ready.”_ The blade vanished into the stone, sealing with it the memory of his judgment and sacrifice.

**Flashback: Cahir – The Heart of the Flame**

In a chamber filled with carved solar motifs, Cahir removed the circlet from his brow—once a symbol of his rulership—and set it upon a pedestal of molten brass. “We were kings once,” he whispered to no one, “but kings must burn away before light can rise again.” As the circlet sank into the metal, the flame within dimmed. He stood for a long time, not as a king, but as a sentinel, and turned his back on the past.

**Flashback: Karsten – The Bound Gauntlet**

Lightning split across the sky beyond the cracked ceiling of the hall. Karsten’s gauntlet, etched with runes that once bent the wind to his will, lay across the lap of a statue shaped in his image. “I broke armies with this,” he said, “but we break nothing today.” He pressed his hand to the statue’s chest, whispering a single line of the Llano that bound the artifact in stasis. The wind fell still, unnaturally still.

**Flashback: Simear – The Mirror of Ashes**

Before the temple’s mirrored pool, Simear held a small obsidian mirror, its surface already dimming. He whispered to it, not in words, but in truths: _who they were, what they had lost, and what must be forgotten._ The mirror shimmered and then darkened as if swallowing the memories whole. He placed it beneath the water. “Let none see until the world can understand.”
