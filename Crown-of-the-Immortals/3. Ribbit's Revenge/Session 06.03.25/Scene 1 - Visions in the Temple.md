## 🎤 Transition to Argail’s Tale

> The chamber is silent. The relics glow faintly, pulsing in rhythm with unseen music. Then, a voice breaks the stillness—calm, resonant, and filled with reverence.

**Argail steps forward.**

> **Argail:**  
> “You have seen what was. Now hear what must be remembered.”

> He raises his hand. The relics respond, casting light and shadow across the walls. His voice deepens, becoming something more than mortal—a vessel for memory, for myth.

![[🎭 Argail’s Tale – “The Last Harmony”]]

- Argail offers final words:
    
    > “The world remembers you now. But it is not memory that will save it—it is action.”
    

**Exit Hook:**

- The temple begins to tremble slightly—as you hear a singler perfect note.
- You feel the temple moving after a few moments you see the light of day through skylights in the chamber  that you didn't know existed.
