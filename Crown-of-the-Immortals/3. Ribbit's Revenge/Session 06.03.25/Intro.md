## 🧭 Adventure Log: The Journey So Far

The party arrived at Oloru and were welcomed by the Namar’Zul. They learned of the Fire Walker Tribe’s attacks and the magical concealment of their camp. Alwor discovered a tapestry referencing the Llano and traced it to a sunken temple beneath the lake. The party built a fire-resistant submersible and used illusion magic to distract the brine sharks.

Inside the temple, they solved a glyph puzzle and surfaced in a chamber where each character experienced a vision of their past life. They met Argail, who guided them to a vault containing their relics and the Llano scroll. Each character reversed their ancient vow to unlock the vault and reclaim their relic.

Now, standing in the Sunken Temple of Cadens, relics in hand and memories stirring, the party faces a new truth. Argail, the Herald of Cadens, awaits their questions. The Llano scroll pulses with quiet power.

Outside, the Fire Walker Tribe grows bolder. Toadwin Greenleaf, heir to the Namar’Zul, has vanished. The hag Velkra prepares a ritual—one that Simear’s mirror may soon reveal.

The party must return to Oloru, rally the Namar’Zul, and begin the hunt for the hidden Fire Walker camp. The fate of the swamp—and perhaps the world—hangs in the balance.
