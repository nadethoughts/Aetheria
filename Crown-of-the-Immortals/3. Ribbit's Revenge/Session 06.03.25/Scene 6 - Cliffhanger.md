### 🧩 Scene 6: Cliffhanger – “The Ember Key Forged” (5–10 min)

**Aftermath:**

- If the Goblin Hexer is captured, they mutter through cracked lips:
    
    > “The Ember Key… it’s almost ready.  
    > The heir’s blood will bind it.  
    > The cauldron burns… and the seal will break.”
    
- The Llano scroll pulses violently in one of the players’ packs—its light flickering like a heartbeat.
    
- A Tripkee scout bursts through the underbrush, panting, wounded, eyes wide:
    
    > “We found it… the hut… in the red trees…  
    > Toadwin is there. They’re going to bleed him into the fire!”
    
- A low rumble echoes through the swamp. The wind shifts. The scent of smoke and iron fills the air.
    

> “The cauldron is boiling. The Ember Key is nearly forged.  
> If you don’t stop them by moonrise… the seal will fall.”
