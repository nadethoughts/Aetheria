## 🧙‍♀️ The Witches’ Hut: Ritual of the Ember Key

### 🏚️ Location:

A twisted, vine-choked hut deep in the Burned Wood, built atop the ruins of an ancient La Pelu shrine. The hut is surrounded by red-leafed trees and warped totems. Inside, a massive cauldron bubbles with glowing embers and blood-red mist.

### 🔥 The Ritual:

The hags are not trying to resurrect Vorath directly—they are attempting to **forge the Ember Key**, a magical construct that will allow them to bypass the divine locks on the Time Turner.

To do this, they need:

- **Toadwin’s blood**, as he is a “soul of balance” tied to the Llano.
- **The cauldron**, which channels the corrupted essence of the Fire Walker totems.
- **A fragment of a La Pelu relic**, stolen from a ruined shrine (perhaps a broken sunstone or shard of the Mirror of Ashes).

### 🧪 Ritual Mechanics:

- The cauldron is the ritual focus. It glows brighter as the ritual progresses.
- Toadwin is suspended above it, unconscious, bound in thorny vines and fire glyphs.
- The hags chant in Infernal and Goblin, invoking the “Unmaker’s Flame.”

### 🧭 Narrative Stakes:

- If the ritual completes, the Ember Key will be forged.
- This key will allow the hags to **breach the Time Turner’s seal** and begin unraveling the Llano’s protections.
- Vorath’s influence will begin to seep into the world—not as a body, but as a **corruptive force** that alters memory, time, and truth.

## ⚔️ Encounter Setup: “The Cauldron of Unmaking”

### Enemies:

- **Velkra**, Hag Matron of the Fire Walker Coven (ritual caster)
- **2 Fire Walker Goblin Brutes** (protecting the hut)
- **1 Goblin Hexer** (maintaining the cauldron’s magic)
- **Environmental Hazard**: The cauldron pulses every round, dealing fire or psychic damage in a 10-ft radius unless disabled.

### Objectives:

- Rescue Toadwin before the ritual completes
- Disable or destroy the cauldron
- Defeat or drive off the hags

### Optional Twist:

- If the party interrupts the ritual mid-casting, the cauldron explodes in a burst of temporal energy, causing a **brief time distortion** (e.g., players relive a round, or enemies act twice).

### 📦 Boxed Text: Arrival at the Witches’ Hut

> The trees thin as you push deeper into the Burned Wood, their red leaves glowing like embers in the fading light. The air grows thick—hot, humid, and heavy with the scent of ash and rot.
> 
> Then you see it.
> 
> A crooked hut rises from the clearing like a wound in the earth. Its roof is sagging under the weight of moss and bone charms. The walls are stitched together from warped wood, bound with sinew and rusted iron. Smoke curls from a crooked chimney, black and oily.
> 
> At the center of the hut, visible through a shattered window, a massive cauldron bubbles with molten light—its glow casting flickering shadows that dance like spirits on the walls.
> 
> Suspended above the cauldron is a figure—Toadwin Greenleaf. Bound in thorny vines, his body hangs limp, his chest rising and falling in shallow breaths.
> 
> Around the cauldron, three figures move in a slow, deliberate circle. Cloaked in tattered robes, their skin cracked and blistered, their eyes glowing with cruel purpose.
> 
> One of them—taller, hunched, her voice like wind through dead leaves—raises a dagger of bone and obsidian.
> 
> _“The Ember Key shall be bound in blood,”_ she rasps.  
> _“The seal shall break. The flame shall open the path.”_
> 
> The cauldron pulses. The forest holds its breath.
