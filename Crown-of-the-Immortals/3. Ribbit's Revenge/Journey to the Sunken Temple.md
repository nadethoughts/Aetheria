## 🧭 Dungeon Structure – _The 5 Rooms of the Sunken Temple_

---

### **Room 1: The Descent – Breach the Temple**

**Room Type:** Hazard Encounter  
**Goal:** Reach the temple alive through the boiling lake.

**Entry Options:**

- **Fire Resistance Potion:** Short-term, risky.
- **Wetsuit-Oil Hybrid:** Grants protection, but reduces mobility.
- **Submersible:** Safe, but noisy—may attract enemies.

**Scene:**  
An obsidian archway juts from scalding depths, surrounded by melted coral and hardened glass sculptures. As they approach, **Brine Sharks** circle—mutated guardians infused with divine fire and loyal to Cadens.

**Encounter Options:**

- **Combat:** Fight 3–4 Brine Sharks (see stat block).
- **Skill Challenge:** Swim, Stealth, or Distract to slip past.
- **Secret Entry:** Harmonic coral gate opens to music. Performance or bardic magic may allow entry without a fight.

### **Room 2: The Flooded Antechamber – Traps of Cadens**

**Room Type:** Puzzle / Trap  
**Goal:** Synchronize with temple defenses to proceed.

**Scene:**  
A vast hallway with musical glyphs pulsing light along the walls and floor. The rhythm shifts, forcing synchronized movement.

**Trap/Puzzle:**

- The glyphs flash in musical time.
- Characters must pass using **Dexterity (Acrobatics)** or **Intelligence (Arcana or Performance)** to move in sync.
- Failure causes:
    - **Thunder Pulse:** 2d8 damage and knockback.
    - **Summoned Guardians:** 1–2 brass constructs (CR 1).

**Optional Reward:** Solving the pattern reveals a hidden alcove containing a **Cadens-blessed healing fountain** (restores HP and 1 focus point or spell slot).

### **Room 3: The Echoing Chamber – Visions of Sacrifice**

**Room Type:** Lore / Vision  
**Goal:** Recover the truth of past lives and their sacrifice.

**Scene:**  
In this dome of mirrored water and floating lights, time bends. The party is drawn into a **shared memory** from their past incarnations:

> Each player embodies their ancient self and sacrifices a powerful **orichalcum artifact** to seal the **Llano Fragment** with the aid of a mysterious gnome named **Selavin Dhrienelion**.

**Roleplay Prompt:** Each player delivers a line or action marking the sacrifice. Let them flavor it—this is a moment of deep identity.

**Outcome:**

- Artifacts are shown and their significance revealed.
- Each is retrievable in Room 5.
- The seal echoes with their soulprints—only they can unbind it.

---

### **Room 4: The Guardian’s Watch – Selavin’s Test**

**Room Type:** Social / Mental / Ritual Trial  
**Goal:** Prove they are worthy of reclaiming what was sacrificed.

**NPC:**  
**Selavin Dhrienelion** — Bleachling Gnome, eternally preserved guardian. His voice rings like crystal and shadow. He tests each soul before allowing the seal to break.

**Trial Options (choose or mix):**

- **Insight of Rhythm:** Solve a riddle or harmonic pattern based on Cadens’ teachings.
- **Trial of Identity:** Duel a spectral version of one’s former self.
- **Offering of the Soul:** Speak a poetic truth or vision explaining why they must reclaim the Llano.

**Failing** does not end the adventure—but it causes:

- Disruption of the vault's protection
- Unstable magical effects in Room 5

---

### **Room 5: The Llano Vault – Fragment and the Relics**

**Room Type:** Climax, Reward, Choice  
**Goal:** Decide the fate of the Llano Fragment and reclaim the relics.

**Scene:**  
The final chamber glows like the inside of a music box. Crystalline gears turn in slow rhythm. The **Llano Fragment** floats in a mirrored stasis cage. Pedestals surround it, each holding the orichalcum relics from Room 3.

**Choices:**

- **Claim the Fragment**: Triggers pursuit—an echo of the Flaming Retribution or ancient defenders.
    
- **Leave the Fragment, Awaken It**: Begin a spiritual bond, unlocking future visions and guidance.
    
- **Use Relics to Forge a New Pact**: Sacrifice one or more items to Cadens to gain divine favor or blessings (boon decided by GM).
    

**Optional Danger:**  
If the seal is broken without passing Selavin’s test, the vault:

- Collapses in unstable time-magic.
    
- Forces a combat with time-clones or a burning vision of the Flaming Retribution.
