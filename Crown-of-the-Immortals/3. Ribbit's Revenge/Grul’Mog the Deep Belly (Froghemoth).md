There is a Giant Amphibian that Trapses around the bog. It is seen to be a force of nature that simply cannot be beaten. It's called Grul'Mog - The Deep Belly — “Grul” being a croaky sound to mimic its bellowing call, and “Deep Belly” implying its hunger and swampy lair.
### Grul'Mog Size Details:

- **Size Category**: Gargantuan
- **Height/Length**: Roughly ***30 feet long or tall***, depending on posture
- **Reach**: Typically 20 feet (especially with long tentacle attacks)

These enormous aberrations are amphibious horrors, well-known for ambushing prey from swamps, bogs, and lakes. Definitely not something you'd want to see rising out of a lake covered in glowing algae... 😬

#### Grul'Mog Foot Size:

- **Length**: 7 feet
- **Width**: 5 feet
- **Toe Span**: Likely webbed with 3–4 massive digits, each ~2 feet long
### **The Scorched Maw**

The Tripkee say the swamp was born in fire and fury.

When the sky cracked and flame poured down like divine judgment, the land that had once been gleaming and golden melted into mire. Trees withered, stone towers sank, and the Blessed Realm’s pride—**Lumopolis**—was swallowed whole by smoke and muck. From that cursed belly of ruin and ash rose a shape too massive to be born of flesh alone: **Grul’Mog**, the Deep Belly.

The Tripkee arrived months later, fleeing storms and strife. They found a swamp still steaming with ruin, thick with strange magic and humming with sorrow. And they found **him**—slumbering in a crater-lake of bones and vines, a behemoth of bloated hunger and quiet rage.

Elders whisper that **Grul’Mog was not born**, but **forged in the flaming retribution**, a punishment given form. They say he is the buried guilt of the gods, or perhaps the guardian of some secret left in the swamp’s shattered heart. Whatever his purpose, the Tripkee know one truth: when he stirs, the fog grows cold and the water grows still.

They leave him offerings. They whisper songs into the mist. And when the ground shakes in the night, they do not go looking.

### **King Halcyon the Radiant**

A once-beloved ruler, praised for his charisma and vision, King Halcyon was said to "walk in the footsteps of the La Pelu," believing he was destined for divinity. His fall was as grand as his name—his light devoured by ambition, now transformed into Grul'Mog the Deep Belly. As he hungered for power and immortality, now he knows nothing but hunger. A mindless, hungry beast.

#### **"The Maw of the Radiant Throne"**

Once called _Halcyon the Radiant_, he is now known among the dark faithful, Drow cultists, and whispered swamp legends as **The Maw of the Radiant Throne**—a cruel joke on his former glory. The name evokes the image of a once-noble king, now a gaping, mindless hunger seated atop the ruins of his kingdom.

This title is often spoken with reverence by those who serve Vorath or Erabose, believing Grul’Mog’s monstrous form is a divine punishment _and_ a sacred tool of their dark gods. Some say the throne still lies buried in his belly—swallowed whole along with the last breath of the Blessed Realm.
