## 🎭 Argail’s Tale – “The Last Harmony”

### 🌅 The Song Before Silence

> _“Before the towers, before the kings,_  
> _Before the Blessed Realm took wing,_  
> _The world was music, pure and wide,_  
> _A song that flowed through time and tide._
> 
> _The Llano sang in every stone,_  
> _In every leaf, in flesh and bone._  
> _And those who heard its sacred call,_  
> _Were La Pelu, guardians of all.”_

### 🕳️ The Shadow’s Whisper

> _“But even light casts deepest shade,_  
> _And one among them was betrayed._  
> _Vorath, proud and fierce and bright,_  
> _Turned his gaze from dawn to night._
> 
> _He heard the voice of Erabose,_  
> _A god of ruin, cloaked and close._  
> _With Syrith’s blade and Maldran’s lies,_  
> _They tore the song from earth and skies._
> 
> _The harmony began to break,_  
> _The seas did boil, the mountains quake._  
> _And from the silence, war was born—_  
> _A world unmade, a world forlorn.”_

### 🛡️ The Rise of the Veilcant Guard

> _“But four stood firm when all else fell,_  
> _Their names now lost to time’s cruel shell—_  
> _Yet echoes linger, strong and true,_  
> _And now I sing them back to you._
> 
> **Kaleo the Resonant**, voice of flame,  
> _Whose song could still the gods by name._  
> _Atop the Spire, he sang the tide,_  
> _And turned despair to hope and pride._
> 
> **Maleko the Sentinel**, crowned in fire,  
> _Held the gate ‘gainst shadow’s ire._  
> _He cast his crown into the flame,_  
> _And rose a shield, not seeking fame._
> 
> **Kekoa the Firebrand**, fierce and wise,  
> _Held Emberdeep ‘neath burning skies._  
> _With wind and flame, he judged the foe,_  
> _And let the guilty only know._
> 
> **Rangi the Seer**, with mirror bright,  
> _Saw treachery before the fight._  
> _He led them through the darkest night,_  
> _With whispered truths and second sight.”_

### 🔒 The Price of Victory

> _“They won the war—but not with cheer,_  
> _For what they saved, they held in fear._  
> _The Llano’s power, pure and vast,_  
> _Could unmake all if held too fast._
> 
> _So they sealed it, deep and far,_  
> _In temple, vault, and mirrored star._  
> _Not just to guard from wicked hands,_  
> _But to prepare for future lands._
> 
> _For they believed, with hearts grown wise,_  
> _That darkness would again arise._  
> _And when it did, the song would wake,_  
> _To arm the just for justice’s sake._
> 
> _The relics too, they locked away,_  
> _To wait for those who’d find the way—_  
> _Not kings, not gods, but hearts made true,_  
> _To rise again, as heroes do.”_

### ☀️ The Dawnfather’s Will

> _“Though they feared what might return,_  
> _The Dawnfather’s light continued to burn._  
> _He did not cast his chosen out,_  
> _Nor silence them with wrath or doubt._
> 
> _He watched. He waited. He forgave,_  
> _And from the ashes, paths He paved._  
> _For when the time was right and near,_  
> _He called them back to persevere._
> 
> _Not to relive the pain once known,_  
> _But to redeem what once was sown._  
> _To wield the past, not as a chain,_  
> _But as a torch through night and flame.”_

### 🔥 The Present Flame

> _“Now the Betrayer stirs once more,_  
> _The goblins dig, the hags implore._  
> _The Time Turner lies cracked and bare,_  
> _And silence thickens in the air._
> 
> _But you… you four… have heard the song,_  
> _The relics wake, the notes grow strong._  
> _You are not just blades and breath—_  
> _You are the echo that defies death.”_

### 🌟 The Final Refrain

> _“So now I ask, not as a bard,_  
> _But as a witness, battle-scarred—_  
> _Will you rise, as once they stood?_  
> _Will you sing, as only you could?_
> 
> _The world still waits, the song still sleeps,_  
> _The flame still burns, the shadow creeps._  
> _The final verse is yours to write—_  
> _Will you bring the dawn… or night?”_

> _(Argail bows his head. The relics glow faintly. The silence that follows is not empty—it is waiting.)_
