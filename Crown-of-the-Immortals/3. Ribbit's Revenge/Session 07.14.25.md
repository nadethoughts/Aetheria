---

### 🛕 Aftermath at the Temple of Cadence

- The party, now wielding their **reclaimed relics**, returns to **Uluru** after raising the Temple of Cadence from the lakebed.
- They assist in repelling a goblin assault alongside **Prince Troubadour** and a Tripty scout.
- The goblins are confirmed to be from the **Firewalker tribe**, identified by their cracked, red-veined skin.

---

### 🧠 Interrogation & Clues

- The captured goblin, questioned by Chief Croakmar’s people, reveals:
    - The goblins pass through **“red trees”** to reach their destination.
    - Their **mistress** is forging the **Ember Key**, which will make her the **master of time**.
    - The key requires the **blood of a prince**.

### 🛶 Into the Swamp

- Sameer has a vision through his **obsidian mirror**:
    - A grove of **red trees**.
    - A **goblin camp**.
    - A **hag** preparing a golden elixir, saying: _“We need the blood of a prince to complete the key.”_
