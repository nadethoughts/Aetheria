# **[Cahir’s](../../PCs/Cahir-Emersyn.md) Interim:**

You embraced the next six months as a time of preparation, both for yourself and for the community. You continued to strengthen your bond with your sister, [Angel](../../../World/Characters/Angel.md), sharing concerns about the strange occurrences surrounding the temple. You also find yourself thinking more and more about protection of the people of this town. 

During this time **[Gald](../../../World/Characters/Gald.md)** played a surprising role for both you and the community. [Gald](../../../World/Characters/Gald.md) had several encounters with the goblins in the Woods. These encounters were not mere skirmishes; they were calculated ambushes meant to probe [Gald](../../../World/Characters/Gald.md)'s knowledge of the land and the temple’s surroundings. Though [Gald](../../../World/Characters/Gald.md) managed to escape each time, the encounters left him rattled. After much thought, he swallowed his pride and reported the goblins’ strange tactics to you, warning that their numbers were growing and that something dark seemed to be driving them. Despite your rivalry, [Gald](../../../World/Characters/Gald.md)’s information proved invaluable to the town’s leadership.

As [Cahir’s](../../PCs/Cahir-Emersyn.md) armed the town’s militia with his expertly crafted weapons, you also found that you had a nack for engineering battlements and fortifying the town, you also kept an eye on his brother’s reports and people of the town are starting to look at you in a new way and defer to you.
## Cahir's Vision

    As you work the forge the Hammer falling in a rythmic crash of hammer on avil. You find your mind wandering to a Desert Land, that you have never seen. You remember standing at the crest of a large dune. You see a mighty army at the bottom of the dune waiting for the attack. You look behind yourself to see your Honor guard. Your company consists giants, humans, Orcs, Elves as well as many other peoples. These people, your people look at you with Admiration and fearce loyalty. You have been through so much together. Each person here would die for you, and you for them. So it is with those that live and die for justice.

  - Strengthened bonds with Angel and town leaders.
  - Armed the town with finely crafted spears.
  - Monitored goblin movements through [Gald](../../../World/Characters/Gald.md)’s reports, increasing vigilance against the threat.
  - Reluctantly worked with [Gald](../../../World/Characters/Gald.md), knowing his brother’s encounters held key information about the goblins.

**[Gald](../../../World/Characters/Gald.md)’s Encounters with the Goblins:**

[Gald](../../../World/Characters/Gald.md) had never cared much for the town or its politics, but the goblin threat had forced him to reconsider. In his hunts through the wilds, he had stumbled upon goblin patrols on more than one occasion. The goblins were smarter than before, using guerrilla tactics to blend into the landscape and avoid detection. They ambushed [Gald](../../../World/Characters/Gald.md) twice, testing his knowledge of the terrain and asking cryptic questions about the temple. Their attacks seemed driven by an obsession with reaching the **Time Turner**.

Though [Gald](../../../World/Characters/Gald.md) had always been a loner, these encounters made him realize that the goblins were not just his problem—they were everyone’s problem. Begrudgingly, he brought the news to [Cahir’s](../../PCs/Cahir-Emersyn.md) and the town leaders. Tensions between the brothers remained high, but [Gald](../../../World/Characters/Gald.md)’s information was critical in setting up defenses and preparing for the inevitable clash with the goblins.

- **Progress:**
  - [Gald](../../../World/Characters/Gald.md) encountered and survived multiple goblin ambushes.
  - Shared vital intelligence with [Cahir’s](../../PCs/Cahir-Emersyn.md) about the goblins' movements and growing numbers.
  - A growing sense of responsibility for the town, despite his dislike for its people.

# **[Karsten](../../PCs/Karsten-Kendrick.md)'s Interim:**

You spent these months in deep reflection, unraveling the mystery of the **Chronal Prism** and how it could be used to repair the Time Turner. You spent time studying ancient texts and investigating the strange temporal phenomena surrounding the temple, determined to uncover any leads that might point them toward more Chronal Prism.

You took the news of the goblins’ activity seriously, working closely with the town leadership. While [Cahir](../../PCs/Cahir-Emersyn.md)'s approach was that of fortifying the town, you took a more proactive approach in taking a unit of [Solaris Sentinals](../../../World/Factions/Solaris-Sentinels.md) and seeking them out, being empowered by the information you got from [Gald](../../../World/Characters/Gald.md), you tracked a majority of the Goblin's activities to be in the direction of [the burned wood](../../../World/Locations/Solaris/New-World/the-burned-wood.md). Thus far you have not been able to find their location, but have had a few skrimishes with them as you have delved deeper into that area.

Your growing role in the community cemented your reputation as a military leader, protector, and champion of [the Solaris Sentinels](../../../World/Factions/Solaris-Sentinels.md). You know the coming months are critical, not just for the town, but for the entire continent of Solaris.

## [Karsten](../../PCs/Karsten-Kendrick.md)'s vision
    As you rest, the heat of the day pressing down on you, a memory suddenly floods your mind. You stand atop a stone platform, overlooking a vast battlefield beneath the scorching desert sun. Your armor gleams with golden sigils, and a bastard sword rests firmly in your hand. Below, rows of soldiers await your command—fierce, disciplined, loyal. The scene feels familiar, like a battle you have fought many times before. The strategy, the shifting sands, the enemy's movements—all unfold with clarity, like pieces on a board.

    You command with precision, guiding your forces as the wind shapes the dunes. Power resonates in your voice, each word bringing justice with the weight of a mighty general. Victory is not just a hope but an inevitability, and you know you are the architect of it. As the memory fades, the weight of those long-past battles lingers—a reminder of the life you once lived, where kingdoms rose or fell by your hand.

- **Progress:**
  - Researched the Chronal Prism and possible locations to find more.
  - Reinforced town defenses with [Cahir’s](../../PCs/Cahir-Emersyn.md) and the leadership.
  - Strengthened his spiritual connection to [Raythelion](../../../World/Religion/Raythelion.md) and [the Solaris Sentinels](../../../World/Factions/Solaris-Sentinels.md).

**[Alwor’s](../../PCs/Alwor-Thistlegift.md) Interim:**

The events at the temple had left you filled with both purpose and uncertainty. Over the six months, you returned to your role as the community’s cheerful morale-booster but found yourself drawn more and more to the mysteries of the **Time Turner**. The visions you experienced in the temple had awakened a deeper connection to [Cadens](../../../World/Religion/Cadens.md) and gave you insight into the time-altering magic surrounding the Chronal Prism.

In addition to your role in the town, you began training your magical abilities in secret, experimenting with the strange bardic spells and new abilities that had begun to manifest. you knew that his newfound powers were tied to the **Llano** or **song of creation**, and that in order to complete the repair to the Great Time Turner, you not only needed to find the Chronal Prism but need to find the right refrain from the Llano to complete the repair.

The Lano and the Great Time Turner are connnected somehow, but you are not sure exactly what that connection is nor what you specifically need to do to get it, but you know it is the key somehow...

## Alwor's vision
    As you sit in a council meeting, you find yourself daydreaming, and you're transported to a time long past. You stand amidst the bustling streets of a grand desert city, its golden sands shimmering under the relentless sun. You are having a conversation with someone familiar, but you can't quite put a name to their face. You feel the weight of responsibility pressing upon your shoulders; your network of connections keep the kingdom afloat. Your mind races as you take the information of this agent and work it into the web of information you have from your other informants. You know you can trust this information because all of your people are as loyal to you as you are to them. How many times have you gotten each of them out of impossible situations?

    You feel a profound connection to the people you protect, knowing that your strategic brilliance keeps them safe. As you stand there, the sun setting behind the dunes, you embrace the memories of a leader who inspired loyalty through intellect and charisma, crafting a legacy that would echo through the ages.

- **Progress:**

**Simear’s Interim:**

Simear used the six months to train and unlock new powers, honing his draconic heritage and experimenting with his abilities. While he remained somewhat detached from the town, he contributed by enhancing their weapons and armor with subtle draconic magic. He knew that his magic was tied to something far greater, and he began to see the goblin threat as an opportunity to test his growing powers.

- **Progress:**
  - Strengthened his magical abilities, unlocking new powers.
  - Helped enhance the town’s defenses with draconic magic.

### The Goblins’ Interim (with Updates from [Gald](../../../World/Characters/Gald.md)’s Encounters)

The goblins, under the control of a dark, unnamed force, spent the last six months digging through the collapsed tunnel to the temple. However, their progress was not without obstacles—[Gald](../../../World/Characters/Gald.md), [Cahir’s](../../PCs/Cahir-Emersyn.md)’s estranged brother, had thwarted several of their attempts to scout the area undetected.

The goblins knew they were being hunted now and moved more carefully, avoiding the town’s patrols and waiting for the right moment to strike. Their leader, driven by a desperate need to control the Time Turner, urged them to move faster, believing that activating the device would allow them to erase the **Flaming Retribution** from history.

- **Progress:**
  - Goblins continued to dig through the collapsed tunnel.
  - Engaged in multiple skirmishes with [Gald](../../../World/Characters/Gald.md), who brought back vital intelligence to the town.
  - Awaiting the right moment to storm the temple once the tunnel is clear.

### The Party’s Next Steps:

The party now understands that the temporary fix using star metal won't last. They must find the **Chronal Prism** to permanently repair the Time Turner before the goblins can activate it. With [Gald](../../../World/Characters/Gald.md)’s reports about the goblins’ increasing presence and their obsession with the Time Turner, time is running out.

Rumors suggest that the **Twilight Spire** and the **Evershift Caverns**, both places warped by temporal magic, might contain enough Chronal Prism to complete the repairs. The party must decide their next move, knowing that each day brings the goblins closer to their goal.
