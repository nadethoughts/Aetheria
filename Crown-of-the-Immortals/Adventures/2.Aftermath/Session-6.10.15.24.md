### 1. **A Fragment of a Map**
- **Location**: In the room with the underground lake, found within a tattered chest or carved into the stone itself.
- **Description**: A fragment of a map made from dark leather, showing a mountain range with ominous ruins marked with the symbol of a shattered sun—Vorath’s mark.
- **Clue**: The ruins are hinted to be "deep in the Western Wastes," giving the players a directional lead on where Vorath may be lurking.

### 2. **A Twisted Goblin Idol**
- **Location**: In one of the side chambers, likely hidden behind rubble or in a goblin chief's quarters.
- **Description**: A small, warped idol crafted from bone and black stone. It depicts a hooded figure with a cracked crown—resembling Vorath’s transformation into "The Betrayer."
- **Clue**: When examined closely, it radiates faint dark magic. Arcane or religious checks might reveal that this idol is associated with a figure known in dark legend for betrayal and corruption, possibly Vorath.

### 3. **Torn Journal Page**
- **Location**: Hidden near the alter dedicated to Vorath, possibly within a crevice or tucked into a goblin's belongings.
- **Description**: A torn page from a human’s journal, stained and worn. It appears to be the musings of a scholar or explorer, chronicling their investigation into dark rumors of an ancient betrayer.
- **Clue**: The journal entry includes a fragment: “The Betrayer stirs in the Ruins of Kuth'Alar, his servants—beasts of the underdark—dig ever deeper to restore him to power. May the gods preserve us.”

### 4. **A Whispering Skull**
- **Location**: A shrine room, found in the goblin tunnels, near the exit door leading toward the temple.
- **Description**: A humanoid skull placed on a pedestal, with small blackened candles around it. The eyes are dark sockets, but an eerie magical aura hangs over it. When approached, the players may hear faint whispers in a language only understood with magic or a successful check.
- **Clue**: The whispers reveal cryptic information about Vorath’s betrayal and his current plan: "The sands of time shall turn again… the Betrayer will rise, and the flame shall be snuffed out."

### 5. **A Faded Tapestry**
- **Location**: Hanging on a wall inside a chamber filled with remnants of ancient goblin history, the tapestry is mostly tattered and ruined.
- **Description**: The faded artwork depicts a vast army, led by a regal figure with a cracked crown, leading a charge against a bright sun symbol. The sun is being consumed by shadows in the tapestry.
- **Clue**: The imagery represents Vorath leading his followers to defy the gods. Closer inspection reveals an inscription in an ancient script: "The hour of betrayal draws near. The past must be undone."

### 6. **Blood-Stained Goblin Runes**
- **Location**: Found in the entrance to a hidden chamber in the tunnels or near one of the tunnel doors, carved into the rock.
- **Description**: Strange goblin runes, written in what appears to be blood, line the walls. The runes speak of a master who promises "a return to a time before the flame" and refers to the Betrayer as "the Unmaker of Ages."
- **Clue**: The runes reveal that the goblins believe Vorath can undo the catastrophic event (the flaming retribution) that devastated their lands, and they are working to awaken him from his slumber.

### 7. **A Cryptic Prayer Scroll**
- **Location**: Found within a goblin shaman’s chamber, perhaps hidden under his bedding or hanging from the ceiling.
- **Description**: A scroll, written in a mix of goblin and infernal, is a prayer to “The Betrayer.” It speaks of raising an ancient master who will restore their tribe’s strength.
- **Clue**: One line stands out: “At the Broken Tower of Kuth'Alar, we shall serve him. In the shadows beneath, he waits to walk the world again.”
