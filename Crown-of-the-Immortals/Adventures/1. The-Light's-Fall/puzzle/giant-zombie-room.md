### Temple Puzzle: Opening the Sarcophagus of Shananooah

#### Room Description
The room is octagonal, filled with sand, and features the following:
- **Three Urns**:
  - **West-North Corner**: Urn A
  - **East-North Corner**: Urn B
  - **East-South Corner**: Urn C
- **Doors**:
  - **South Door**: Represents the Past
  - **North Door**: Represents the Future (locked)
  - **West Door**: Represents the Present (locked)
- **Sarcophagus**: Located in the center of the room, adorned with symbols of time and space.
- **Pedestals**:
  - **Next to South Door**: Pedestal for the Past
  - **Next to North Door**: Pedestal for the Future
  - **Next to West Door**: Pedestal for the Present

#### Objective
Open the sarcophagus to retrieve the Bastard Sword by placing the urns on the correct pedestals.

#### Puzzle Mechanics
The urns must be placed on specific pedestals to unlock the sarcophagus. Each urn has a glyph corresponding to a phase of time:
- **Urn A**: Past
- **Urn B**: Present
- **Urn C**: Future

#### Clues
1. **Sand Patterns**: The sand around the room forms subtle patterns, directing attention to the three urns and hinting at their order.
2. **Glyphs**: Each urn has an inscription:
   - **Urn A (West-North)**: "The past lays the foundation."
   - **Urn B (East-North)**: "The present stands firm."
   - **Urn C (East-South)**: "The future unveils the truth."
3. **Pedestal Inscription**: Each pedestal has a corresponding glyph and inscription:
   - **South Pedestal**: "Reflect on what has been"
   - **West Pedestal**: "Focus on the here and now."
   - **North Pedestal**: "Turn your gaze to what lies ahead"

#### Solution
1. **Urn A (West-North)**: Place on the South Pedestal.
2. **Urn B (East-North)**: Place on the West Pedestal.
3. **Urn C (East-South)**: Place on the North Pedestal.

Upon placing the urns on the correct pedestals, a mechanism within the floor activates.

#### Result
The sarcophagus slowly opens, revealing a Bastard Sword resting inside. Additionally, the mechanisms unlock the North and West doors, providing further access within the temple.

#### Challenges
- **Perception Check (DC 15)**: To notice the subtle sand patterns leading to the urns and pedestals.
- **Arcana Check (DC 13)**: To understand the glyphs and their meanings.
- **Strength Check (DC 10)**: To lift and move the urns.

#### Extra Details
- **Hidden Compartment**: Inside the sarcophagus, along with the Bastard Sword, there's a hidden compartment containing a scroll with a minor time-related spell or lore about Shananooah.
- **Traps**: If the urns are placed on the wrong pedestals, a minor sand trap activates, causing sand to fill the room slightly, creating a need for quick problem-solving to avoid being buried.

### Narrative Description
Upon entering the octagonal room, the air is thick with ancient dust, and the ground is covered in a thin layer of sand. The central sarcophagus, adorned with intricate carvings of time and space, beckons with an aura of mystery. Three large urns stand in the corners of the room, each bearing an ancient glyph.

The urns represent the past, present, and future, pivotal elements in the domain of Shananooah, Goddess of Time. To unlock the secrets of the sarcophagus and reveal its treasure, the adventurers must understand and manipulate the flow of time through these urns.

With careful observation and interpretation of the clues, the path to unveiling the sarcophagus lies in the correct placement of these sacred urns on the pedestals corresponding to the past, present, and future. The correct arrangement will not only unlock the tomb but also the knowledge and power it guards.
